Each year, I am always thinking about the kind of post that I want to draft and share amidst all the highs and lows as we approach the new year. 2018 was a year of retrospection, a year to take it slow, a year to re-set new goals and ambitions in life, a year to look after my pending health issues and finally, a year to be a better (Family) person. I know that the last part of my sentence can sound a bit confusing, but in reality, this was one area I struggled to cope up with the most. Whether it was making time to call up my parents in my very busy life or speaking to my childhood bestie (which wasn't more than 8-10 odd times this year) or taking up 'at home' responsibilities a lot more seriously. I intended to be a better person, making time to do things at home with a lot more passion indulge in forgotten hobbies, doing daily yet understated routines better and making time for exercising at least 3-4 times in a week without fail. Blogging as an industry, as a business has changed completely in 2018 and even though I am one of the first gen bloggers, I find it quite difficult to cope up with the virtual life with all the craziness that I have in my real life. If you have read my post on how to make money by blogging in India, or how much money I earn by blogging then you'll know that in today's age time, personal development is being compromised to live an 'Instagram' perfect life and I am guilty of doing the same. Having said that, if you are a married (to someone who doesn't even close to your profession), have things-to-do (home edition and not personal skincare list), have compromised your health to some extent or have wandered aimlessly on your mobile apps (for hours) this year, then this the post for you!Each year, I am always thinking about the kind of post that I want to draft and share amidst all the highs and lows as we approach the new year. 2018 was a year of retrospection, a year to take it slow, a year to re-set new goals and ambitions in life, a year to look after my pending health issues and finally, a year to be a better (Family) person.

I already feel judged to share this- but I haven't read any book after the first one and only saw films, the Harry Potter studio in London to know things in details. 4. Don't travel for Instagram perfect photos. It's important to travel, live your experience, learn about a place you visit and still not have perfect Instagram photos. The business of 'influencing' is only effective when your experiences make people opt for that very thing that you used or endorsed. Branded travels are a different game altogether but when you are traveling with family or your loved ones on a non-sponsored journey than try not to fall for perfect photos. It will save you time and help you see places from a different perspective. I made it a point to share a few peels of all the travels I undertook in the second half of the year and it just made me happier!Note to self: keep continuing with posting-less-photos-while-traveling to make most of a trip!5. It's OKAY to change your goals and ambitions in life as you grow old. There's no harm in developing an idea with utmost passion while you are continuing with your present journey. For bloggers, Goals, ambitions will change and Moreover, the lives of your readers will also change. Ambitious people are goal oriented and are always striving towards the next milestone. Don't feel too bad if your current project doesn't excite you anymore- you can always change your job, your work profile, your travel plans, your business ideas, your content feed on Instagram et al. Your ambitions also control your quality vs quantity parameter- For say, I don't believe in anyone on social media who gets excited about EVERY new product launch in the market and then goes all ga-ga about it on their social media, this is also a reason why you'll notice me cutting down on so many product collabs  from same product category on my blog. For a long time I resisted this change but after 7 years of blogging, and many small projects in between- here I am with Weddingbytes.in. A label that I have co-created with my most passionate team to bring to you guys wedding basics and ethnic Indian wear at great price points!Note to self: Master the art of balancing between projects and go all out with weddingbytes in 2019.6. Avoid the trap of comparing yourself to others. I have been guilty of doing this and have felt disappointed at times on not working with some brands or how some influencers were getting to do so much whereas I was struggling with time...Over the due course I have come to terms with the fact that you should measure your success with how much you are able to stretch yourself, cross your own limits. Setting goals and working towards them with passion and focus will help you achieve everything and at the same time appreciate other's success genuinely.Note to self: Get inspired by other people's fire but always remember to set your limit in 20197. Practice manifestation for positive thoughts will attract positive outcomes. I am pretty new at this but my mom's surgery post-Diwali this year and a few other life touching incidents have assured my faith in the power of manifestation. You can begin with a gratitude journal or meditate your desires or begin with simply visualizing what and how the outcome will make you feel like to attract all positive vibrations. This is science and if you find doing this tough then believe in the powers of prayers and pray atleast once in 24 hours. You can learn more about manifestation here.Note to self: Do Not Question the Universe Too Much.My finale outfit post had to be a saree and this entire look is from my label weddingbytes. The hair and makeup have been done by my talented MUA, Shilpi. The stunning photos have been taken by Dulhan herself, Megha. Also, a big shoutout to Doubletree by Hilton, Gurgaon for helping us with the most pleasing locations. I love our festivals mostly because I go on a shopping spree for new ethnic Indian outfits. 2018 has been big on the wide-legged trend even when it came to quintessential India wear. Pallazos, Shararas, ghararas, wide-legged pants under kurta- there has been everything on the must-have list. I swear...I discovered so many new, homegrown, local fashion brands doing Indian wear like never before. So when I have to pick A LOT many number of festive outfits and still stick to a budget, I always fall back on my tried and tested Amazon Indian Fashion website. I have tried so many smaller, newer labels and needless to say, I love my shopping experience. This sharara set from Amazon comes from a brand called Khushal and is made of 100% cotton fabric. I love the block printed pattern on the entire set with a subtle gota design on the neckline. It is indeed a great bet for home pujas and card parties. I bought a Medium size but it is extremely fitted and hence I would recommend for you to go a size down for a more comfortable fit or rather refer to the size chart for exact details. Also, this stunning ensemble is priced at INR 1299 on Amazon and can be purchased here on this link.I love our festivals mostly because I go on a shopping spree for new ethnic Indian outfits. 2018 has been big on the wide-legged trend even when it came to quintessential India wear.

With over 60% market share, Orient Electrics also happens to be the largest exporter of fans from India. Having been associated with the brand in the past only made me happier to finally take a tour of their assembly line at Orient Electric’s Faridabad plant. From enjoying a dominant position in the fan industry to creating some path-breaking technology in fans, Orient Electric today has the widest range of products in its portfolio. As a fashion aficionado, the key takeaway for me is the fact that they have laid a great emphasis on the aesthetics of their products that comes packed with a cutting-edge technology. The factory visit was a great learning experience for our group that featured popular lifestyle bloggers and technology enthusiasts. It is not every day that you get invited to visit one of the largest manufacturers of ceiling fans in India.

The factory visit was a great learning experience for our group that featured popular lifestyle bloggers and technology enthusiasts. As we arrived at the Orient factory, we all were taken to the experience room that featured a wide range of all types of fans Orient Electric manufactures. From ceiling fans, to pedestal fans, wall fans, table fans and multi-utility fans there was so much to discover. I spotted incomparable technology, premier quality, inordinate aesthetics all along. I also learnt that these products are reliable for a long-term usage, are super easy to clean and have been designed keeping different kinds of environment in mind.Everything at Orient Electrics comes together at their Faridabad plant assembly line. We were given a complete download of the brand, its mission, core values by its Senior leadership team who by the way shared the utmost passion for this product line in the industry. There was so much to learn at every pitstop- from dangling blades to automated painting machines, to motor assembly units to quality control tests that finally culminates into a desirable packaging. I wish we could shoot some more photos of their R&D labs, innovation center but guess that’s not for everyone to see.With innovations happening in every aspect, Orient Electric boasts of their PSPO technology that helps provide cooler air in a larger space while consuming less power to the BLDC (brushes direct current motor) which basically means that they have successfully been able to reduce the power consumption by over 50% with their products in the industry. Their Aero Series has continued to wow consumers both for its aesthetics and overall effectiveness. From being very silent revolutionary fans to sporting contemporary designs- the #AeroSeries have created its own niche with its range of super premium fans in the market. I remember attending the launch of their Aerostorm fan in January that is inspired from aerofoil design of Aircraft wings and is reinforced with winglet technology. This one, in particular, gave an astounding air delivery of 300 CMM. It is not every day that you get invited to visit one of the largest manufacturers of ceiling fans in India.

Ever since my wedding, I have become so pro handlooms, made in India fashion and homegrown labels. You'll notice that many of my summer fashion stories featuring local/desi fashion brands going forward but hey, that doesn't mean that I won't be spotted wearing Shein, Romwe, Koovs fashion ;)I love the summer sun for I can wear the cotton fabric in all its glory!

Of all the things I got for myself from London, this high waisted Zara pants has been the best purchase till day. I have worn these flared pants with just about everything and yet they look absolutely new and well fitted (rather perfectly fitted). The top is another favorite summer purchase from Jaypore.com. The hand block printed crop top here is basically a saree blouse but that's the beauty of the Indian handlooms. They are versatile, look very pretty and can be styled for a laid-back summer look almost all the time. The indigo with red accents is my favorite combination especially when it comes to block prints. As for the accessories, I am wearing another (over-used) clutch purse that I bought from Sonam and Rhea Kapoor's brand Rheson. This one is available on Shopper's Stop website online (at a discounted price now) along with pink boho earrings- another London purchase from Primark store and blue sunnies courtesy the good folks at Lenskart.

We stayed at the spectacular Taj Madikeri property and kick-started our #CaptureYourSenses drive from there! I am sure that most of you saw my #RenaultCaptur posts on Instagram wherein I traveled to the beautiful city of Coorg for a very exciting experience with Renault India!

We stayed at the spectacular Taj Madikeri property and kick-started our #CaptureYourSenses drive from there! The two days were action packed and I not only got a chance to drive the very stylish SUV, but all of us influencers explored the massive capabilities of the Renault Captur in rough and crazy terrains. For an adventure aficionado like me who also loves driving- this vehicle makes for a very hands-on choice for SUV. It’s a car that’s fabulously good looking, has very impressive exteriors, smooth lines and offers close to 50+ features. The C-shaped Sapphire LED DRLs are the bomb, and then you also have an integrated audio system being offered as standard equipment in the vehicle. The Renault CAPTUR boasts of an expressive design, great innovation and a committed performance that makes for a great drive. This car is designed to handle any kind of roads and as we drove to Mandalpatti and thereafter the tougher off-road terrain, CAPTUR offered a much flawless drive. It is outright wide and comes with a remarkable ground clearance of 210mm. I am sure that most of you saw my #RenaultCaptur posts on Instagram wherein I traveled to the beautiful city of Coorg for a very exciting experience with Renault India!

Along with this you can also unlock the smartphone from the front camera using the Face Access technology.The phone sports a 5.99-inch IPS display (1440x720 pixels) protected with a Corning Gorilla Glass on top.

The device sports a thick portion on one side that helps you hold it firmly and then with the screen it tapers into a thin side measuring 3.4 millimeters that ultimately results in balancing the e-book, no matter which hand you’re reading with. Reading on this premium e-book feels as light as paper as the Kindle Oasis is over 20% lighter and 30% thinner on average than any other Kindle.This Kindle is exclusive in so many ways, for instance- you can physically turn pages using the buttons on the right side or simply tap utilizing the touchscreen option. An accelerometer rotates the page when you switch hands, and the page transitions are the fastest I’ve ever seen on an E Ink display. Whether I am sitting in a Delhi metro or an evening cab, reading on Kindle Oasis is a genuinely immersive experience. The adaptive front light will dim and brighten depending on where you are, which also gets a big thumbs up from me. Currently, I am reading YouTuber Lilly Singh’s super fun biography on Kindle Oasis, and I have only charged the device just once. The Amazon Kindle Oasis offers 6-weeks on a single charge, which can help you finish approximately two books. The marquee feature of this year’s Oasis is its water resistance. The Oasis is designed to work after immersion in up to two meters in water for up to an hour so you must co sider carrying it with you to the beach, to the poolside or a Jacuzzi when you are traveling :)The new Oasis can sync your reading positions across Audible books and ebooks. If you have bought both the ebook and the audiobook you can seamlessly switch between the two by using a pair of Bluetooth headphones or a speaker connected to the Oasis, a feature that’s an absolute winner. You can also choose between two storage options- 8GB and 32GB for your device. The more prominent screen makes reading better and makes for a great indulgence no matter what.I had been an avid reader in my life until I resumed my first job, changed a few to don the hat of an entrepreneur finally. In between growing up and blogging, I realized that I had (almost) stopped reading novels, books; biographies that helped me shape up my thoughts to become who I am today really. So when Amazon India reached out to me to test their all-new launch, the Kindle Oasis- I couldn’t have been more excited.

HIRE good resources that can help you grow and add value to your business. I didn’t have huge budgets when I did my first hiring, and I chose to hire at home moms who quit their corporate jobs. They were (and have been) professional, dependable and multi-taskers. I ensured to update my website every single day, and today we post about 12-15 or more blogs in 1 day. I decided to hire because I wanted the site to grow and with our growing website traffic (significant numbers here), I have only scored more and more brand opportunities.As I complete 6 years of doing what I love doing the most, my heart is filled with immense gratitude, love, emotions, and excitement brimming all at once. It was only 6 years ago that I posted my first ever blog post which was then known as an ‘article’ and shared it on my Facebook personal profile. I am not going back to where and how it all started, but I have instead decided to share how I have managed to stay on top of my blogging game, turn it into a consistent business and win awards in between ;) Few blog anniversaries ago, I had posted this article on how I turned blogging into a full-time business in India and a lot many of you loved it. I wouldn’t lie, but I started getting passionate emails from new bloggers seeking advice on how to start a successful fashion blog. From what I can collect- I have worked with over 1000 brands that include startups, more prominent corporations, individuals, agencies and at home labels. The few things that ensured that my business was a consistent one (read not having to worry about my salaries after I quit my full-time job) are as follows-  1.    Authenticity is an indispensable tool. Many times multiple bloggers work on a client’s campaign together hence its imperative for you to have your own perspective and not cltr+c someone else’s ideas/shoots/outfits. Not every time I may have had a very Instagram perfect photo that someone else for the same brand may have put, but I have learned to trust my intuition and my voice foremost.  It may not be perfect, but it has worked with my followers and makes for a unique selling point.2.    Its okay to miss out! I am married and am a proud Army wife that has kept me on my toes owing to my duties towards the organization and then I am a full-time content person, a blogger, and a branding consultant. While it may sound like a lot (and there’s no doubt that it really is), I have never pushed myself to post my personal life or an OOTD on my feed. I have had days when I haven’t posted any content on my Instagram feed or Facebook page. While this may sound like a bad business plan- trust me, you can be MIA and still be very significant online.

I want to stress on the fact that I cook food, do dishes (if the maid doesn’t turn up), manage laundry and groceries and have to be socially active in sarees in our fauji fraternity and travel between cities for work and yet not give up. I can’t give my best shot every single day on my social media accounts but that still won’t stop me from going all out as and when I want. So, don’t stop doing what makes you happy just because it doesn’t pay you for long. Your voice is at the heart of your business and should take center stage in everything you do. DON’T stop responding to emails just because it’s a barter proposal, or because someone was seeking your free advice. Being true to who you are and sharing your message is so much more important than just putting something out there to “check it off your list.” When you think you are at your peak, remember to get even better.

HIRE good resources that can help you grow and add value to your business. I didn’t have huge budgets when I did my first hiring, and I chose to hire at home moms who quit their corporate jobs. They were (and have been) professional, dependable and multi-taskers. I ensured to update my website every single day, and today we post about 12-15 or more blogs in 1 day. I decided to hire because I wanted the site to grow and with our growing website traffic (significant numbers here), I have only scored more and more brand opportunities.4. Be aware of the ‘surprise’ costs and then decide your collab commercials/costings! If you outsource your photography and styling projects, then you already know about this one. From website hosting to blog designing to clothing, accessories, makeup to post photo shoot lunches- there are a lot of hidden costs. Calculate your fees in advance and create a budget that works for your income level and then commit to a brand. Just remember to evaluate your growth step by step. Also, don’t be scared o re-invest aggressively!!!5.    Pay attention to numbers! You may want to position yourself as a fashion blogger, but your food posts get more hits/video views then its time for our to re-invent your content strategy. Don’t be shy to experiment and read your analytics for numbers don’t lie!!!!!! While your niche can remain fashion, you shouldn’t shy away from writing about Bollywood fashion, beauty trends, etc. In case you don’t feel too convinced about this one then just know that I WON ELLE Beauty Blogger of the year award in 2014 and then again I won COSMOPOLITAN Lifestyle blogger award in 2016- different categories and it still works!6.    #MakeMoves to reach your long-term goals! I want to stress on the fact that I cook food, do dishes (if the maid doesn’t turn up), manage laundry and groceries and have to be socially active in sarees in our fauji fraternity and travel between cities for work and yet not give up. I can’t give my best shot every single day on my social media accounts but that still won’t stop me from going all out as and when I want. So, don’t stop doing what makes you happy just because it doesn’t pay you for long. Your voice is at the heart of your business and should take center stage in everything you do. DON’T stop responding to emails just because it’s a barter proposal, or because someone was seeking your free advice. Being true to who you are and sharing your message is so much more important than just putting something out there to “check it off your list.” When you think you are at your peak, remember to get even better. Opportunities won’t stop; brands won’t stop working with bloggers/influencers so continue to make moves for your long-term goals. For consistency of any business, you have to remain tad-bit disciplined, and one thing that has changed my work-life is that I write down my to-do list every single day. The front page reads editing blog posts, responding to emails and the backside reads onions ½ kg, tomatoes 1 kg, lassan-adrak (garlic-ginger) and more ;)As I complete 6 years of doing what I love doing the most, my heart is filled with immense gratitude, love, emotions, and excitement brimming all at once. It was only 6 years ago that I posted my first ever blog post which was then known as an ‘article’ and shared it on my Facebook personal profile. I am not going back to where and how it all started, but I have instead decided to share how I have managed to stay on top of my blogging game, turn it into a consistent business and win awards in between ;) Few blog anniversaries ago, I had posted this article on how I turned blogging into a full-time business in India and a lot many of you loved it. I wouldn’t lie, but I started getting passionate emails from new bloggers seeking advice on how to start a successful fashion blog. From what I can collect- I have worked with over 1000 brands that include startups, more prominent corporations, individuals, agencies and at home labels. The few things that ensured that my business was a consistent one (read not having to worry about my salaries after I quit my full-time job) are as follows-  1.    Authenticity is an indispensable tool. Many times multiple bloggers work on a client’s campaign together hence its imperative for you to have your own perspective and not cltr+c someone else’s ideas/shoots/outfits. Not every time I may have had a very Instagram perfect photo that someone else for the same brand may have put, but I have learned to trust my intuition and my voice foremost.  It may not be perfect, but it has worked with my followers and makes for a unique selling point.2.    Its okay to miss out! I am married and am a proud Army wife that has kept me on my toes owing to my duties towards the organization and then I am a full-time content person, a blogger, and a branding consultant. While it may sound like a lot (and there’s no doubt that it really is), I have never pushed myself to post my personal life or an OOTD on my feed. I have had days when I haven’t posted any content on my Instagram feed or Facebook page. While this may sound like a bad business plan- trust me, you can be MIA and still be very significant online.

I decided to hire because I wanted the site to grow and with our growing website traffic (significant numbers here), I have only scored more and more brand opportunities.4. Be aware of the ‘surprise’ costs and then decide your collab commercials/costings! If you outsource your photography and styling projects, then you already know about this one. From website hosting to blog designing to clothing, accessories, makeup to post photo shoot lunches- there are a lot of hidden costs. Calculate your fees in advance and create a budget that works for your income level and then commit to a brand. Just remember to evaluate your growth step by step. Also, don’t be scared o re-invest aggressively!!!5.    Pay attention to numbers! You may want to position yourself as a fashion blogger, but your food posts get more hits/video views then its time for our to re-invent your content strategy. Don’t be shy to experiment and read your analytics for numbers don’t lie!!!!!! While your niche can remain fashion, you shouldn’t shy away from writing about Bollywood fashion, beauty trends, etc. In case you don’t feel too convinced about this one then just know that I WON ELLE Beauty Blogger of the year award in 2014 and then again I won COSMOPOLITAN Lifestyle blogger award in 2016- different categories and it still works!6.    #MakeMoves to reach your long-term goals! I want to stress on the fact that I cook food, do dishes (if the maid doesn’t turn up), manage laundry and groceries and have to be socially active in sarees in our fauji fraternity and travel between cities for work and yet not give up. I can’t give my best shot every single day on my social media accounts but that still won’t stop me from going all out as and when I want. So, don’t stop doing what makes you happy just because it doesn’t pay you for long. Your voice is at the heart of your business and should take center stage in everything you do. DON’T stop responding to emails just because it’s a barter proposal, or because someone was seeking your free advice. Being true to who you are and sharing your message is so much more important than just putting something out there to “check it off your list.” When you think you are at your peak, remember to get even better. Opportunities won’t stop; brands won’t stop working with bloggers/influencers so continue to make moves for your long-term goals. For consistency of any business, you have to remain tad-bit disciplined, and one thing that has changed my work-life is that I write down my to-do list every single day. The front page reads editing blog posts, responding to emails and the backside reads onions ½ kg, tomatoes 1 kg, lassan-adrak (garlic-ginger) and more ;) Here’s to #smashingsixyearswithguiltbytes and many more milestones!...Oh and for the giveaway, one of you can win a stunning HUDA beauty 3D Highlighter palette.As I complete 6 years of doing what I love doing the most, my heart is filled with immense gratitude, love, emotions, and excitement brimming all at once. It was only 6 years ago that I posted my first ever blog post which was then known as an ‘article’ and shared it on my Facebook personal profile. I am not going back to where and how it all started, but I have instead decided to share how I have managed to stay on top of my blogging game, turn it into a consistent business and win awards in between ;) Few blog anniversaries ago, I had posted this article on how I turned blogging into a full-time business in India and a lot many of you loved it. I wouldn’t lie, but I started getting passionate emails from new bloggers seeking advice on how to start a successful fashion blog. From what I can collect- I have worked with over 1000 brands that include startups, more prominent corporations, individuals, agencies and at home labels. The few things that ensured that my business was a consistent one (read not having to worry about my salaries after I quit my full-time job) are as follows-  1.    Authenticity is an indispensable tool. Many times multiple bloggers work on a client’s campaign together hence its imperative for you to have your own perspective and not cltr+c someone else’s ideas/shoots/outfits. Not every time I may have had a very Instagram perfect photo that someone else for the same brand may have put, but I have learned to trust my intuition and my voice foremost.  It may not be perfect, but it has worked with my followers and makes for a unique selling point.2.    Its okay to miss out! I am married and am a proud Army wife that has kept me on my toes owing to my duties towards the organization and then I am a full-time content person, a blogger, and a branding consultant. While it may sound like a lot (and there’s no doubt that it really is), I have never pushed myself to post my personal life or an OOTD on my feed. I have had days when I haven’t posted any content on my Instagram feed or Facebook page. While this may sound like a bad business plan- trust me, you can be MIA and still be very significant online. I come back with brand collabs, throwback photos and I don’t feel apologetic about it. On the other hand, my blog is regularly updated (more details in the next point)3.    HIRE, HIRE, HIRE!

I have had days when I haven’t posted any content on my Instagram feed or Facebook page. While this may sound like a bad business plan- trust me, you can be MIA and still be very significant online. I come back with brand collabs, throwback photos and I don’t feel apologetic about it. On the other hand, my blog is regularly updated (more details in the next point)3.    HIRE, HIRE, HIRE! Blogging is not just a hobby to most, and since there’s so much happening around us always, it’s impossible to be everywhere. HIRE good resources that can help you grow and add value to your business. I didn’t have huge budgets when I did my first hiring, and I chose to hire at home moms who quit their corporate jobs. They were (and have been) professional, dependable and multi-taskers. I ensured to update my website every single day, and today we post about 12-15 or more blogs in 1 day. I decided to hire because I wanted the site to grow and with our growing website traffic (significant numbers here), I have only scored more and more brand opportunities.4. Be aware of the ‘surprise’ costs and then decide your collab commercials/costings! If you outsource your photography and styling projects, then you already know about this one. From website hosting to blog designing to clothing, accessories, makeup to post photo shoot lunches- there are a lot of hidden costs. Calculate your fees in advance and create a budget that works for your income level and then commit to a brand. Just remember to evaluate your growth step by step. Also, don’t be scared o re-invest aggressively!!!5.    Pay attention to numbers! You may want to position yourself as a fashion blogger, but your food posts get more hits/video views then its time for our to re-invent your content strategy. Don’t be shy to experiment and read your analytics for numbers don’t lie!!!!!! While your niche can remain fashion, you shouldn’t shy away from writing about Bollywood fashion, beauty trends, etc. In case you don’t feel too convinced about this one then just know that I WON ELLE Beauty Blogger of the year award in 2014 and then again I won COSMOPOLITAN Lifestyle blogger award in 2016- different categories and it still works!6.    #MakeMoves to reach your long-term goals! I want to stress on the fact that I cook food, do dishes (if the maid doesn’t turn up), manage laundry and groceries and have to be socially active in sarees in our fauji fraternity and travel between cities for work and yet not give up. I can’t give my best shot every single day on my social media accounts but that still won’t stop me from going all out as and when I want. So, don’t stop doing what makes you happy just because it doesn’t pay you for long. Your voice is at the heart of your business and should take center stage in everything you do. DON’T stop responding to emails just because it’s a barter proposal, or because someone was seeking your free advice. Being true to who you are and sharing your message is so much more important than just putting something out there to “check it off your list.” When you think you are at your peak, remember to get even better. Opportunities won’t stop; brands won’t stop working with bloggers/influencers so continue to make moves for your long-term goals. For consistency of any business, you have to remain tad-bit disciplined, and one thing that has changed my work-life is that I write down my to-do list every single day. The front page reads editing blog posts, responding to emails and the backside reads onions ½ kg, tomatoes 1 kg, lassan-adrak (garlic-ginger) and more ;) Here’s to #smashingsixyearswithguiltbytes and many more milestones!...Oh and for the giveaway, one of you can win a stunning HUDA beauty 3D Highlighter palette.1.

It was only 6 years ago that I posted my first ever blog post which was then known as an ‘article’ and shared it on my Facebook personal profile. I am not going back to where and how it all started, but I have instead decided to share how I have managed to stay on top of my blogging game, turn it into a consistent business and win awards in between ;) Few blog anniversaries ago, I had posted this article on how I turned blogging into a full-time business in India and a lot many of you loved it. I wouldn’t lie, but I started getting passionate emails from new bloggers seeking advice on how to start a successful fashion blog. From what I can collect- I have worked with over 1000 brands that include startups, more prominent corporations, individuals, agencies and at home labels. The few things that ensured that my business was a consistent one (read not having to worry about my salaries after I quit my full-time job) are as follows-  1.    Authenticity is an indispensable tool. Many times multiple bloggers work on a client’s campaign together hence its imperative for you to have your own perspective and not cltr+c someone else’s ideas/shoots/outfits. Not every time I may have had a very Instagram perfect photo that someone else for the same brand may have put, but I have learned to trust my intuition and my voice foremost.  It may not be perfect, but it has worked with my followers and makes for a unique selling point.2.    Its okay to miss out!

And as Holiday Season has officially started, our favorite brands had gone on sale and made us happier. Check out Lulu & Sky as it's upto 60% off and we are loving it. Lulu & Sky & Their Party EditsFor starters, I have always considered dupatta as a statement accessory that's designed for you to have fun with especially when you go all out to do desi girl fashion! The beauty of statement accessories is that it only takes one piece to make your whole outfit stand out. Hence I focus on keeping it simple with a maximum of two eye-catching pieces by striking a right kind of balance. I love this champagne colored suit that I got from designer Ritu Kumar's store in Pune. To this neutral set, I added a striking green dupatta with Sitara work by designer Abhinav Mishra and some accessories. To draw attention to the bottoms, I decided to pick shoes from Aldo India and needless to say, I love the overall grace it adds to my ensemble. You can never ever go wrong with a maang tikka, and this is why I suggest that you do away with any kind of chunky jewelry and spot a bold jewel for the wedding parties.Photo: Megha Jain, @SunflarearthouseThis winter, Abhinav Mishra is showering an underlying magical vibe to your wardrobe with his all new collection- Haseen by Abhinav Mishra. The new bridal and wedding wear line is young, modern and yet has an earthiness to perfection.

My sister and I have been best friends for life and I wouldn’t lie but I really was her absolute bridesmaid at her wedding and if only bridesmaid were glorified in those times (2011 precisely) then I would have broken the internet will all the maddening things I did for her. Whether it was about finding the right colored chooda for her, or the Jodha Akbar nath in the year she got married or leading the dancing preps or even making an adult cake at home for her bachelorette – I did it all. And when my time came, well….she got preggers! But since she has been always over enthusiastic about wedding shopping and planning, she did what she could for me! This is how important the sister of the bride really is and that’s why my today’s look is like an ode to the best bridesmaid featuring some outfit ideas that the bride’s sister can steal for the big family celebrations!According to me, the sister of the bride makes the wedding preps come alive!!

You can play with colours, the fabric, and the accessories individually and together as well. I personally love flowy silhouettes and this year has been all about cotton and gota work so that’s why I picked up this sunshine yellow sharara set with gota work from The Neh Store, Shahpurjat.  I love how pink chanderi silk dupatta adds a pop of colour to the ensemble. I am done with overdressing for the season and that’s why you can see me play with jewellery here. Ladies don’t shy away from creating outfits where jewelry can be a conversation starter. I am sporting a stamen maang tika with a choker necklace that adds royalty to the timeless designer set that I am sporting. As for the makeup, golden glitter eyes and pink lips work like a classic combination that one can’t go wrong with! You can wear comfortable juttis with the look or elevate the outfit with a pair of stilettoes- the choice is absolutely yours! According to me, the sister of the bride makes the wedding preps come alive!!

While there are so many different elements that go into making a perfect bridal look, hair is something that plays such a significant role that you can’t imagine and it becomes even more important if you are planning for a destination wedding. For a destination bride, there is such a huge opportunity to play with her hair using color in terms of contouring, highlights, global coloring, strobing and so much more!On a recent visit to Mumbai, I decided to drop by at the L'oreal Academy and play with my hair yet again. That is where I learned that whether you’re a bride or now in my case a bridesmaid, ‘Destination Brides’ collection by Matrix is exactly what you need for your picture-perfect day. Destination Brides is a collection of three unique looks crafted by hairstylists and inspired by the gorgeous wedding destinations.Not many of you would know, but the one thing that always catches my attention at a wedding is a bride’s hair color and the hairstyle she sports.

That is where I learned that whether you’re a bride or now in my case a bridesmaid, ‘Destination Brides’ collection by Matrix is exactly what you need for your picture-perfect day. Destination Brides is a collection of three unique looks crafted by hairstylists and inspired by the gorgeous wedding destinations.The Matrix team introduced the three individual looks of the collection to me with three beautiful wedding destinations - The Modern Maharani bride with a touch of royal opulence for those regal palaces, The Boho Beach Bride with a young and carefree vibe for the free-spirited beaches and the Ethereal Garden bride with a charm found only in the lush gardens.After going through the lookbook, I knew exactly what I wanted! To be the boho beach bride because it was so exciting and I always fancied having a beach wedding!Hair is such an important accessory to highlight your facial features and your overall personality to perfection. When you play with your hair, in terms of both styling and color, you can actually carry off any look with utmost confidence.For me personally, I followed a very strict regime for my wedding and I also gave a lot of importance to my hair styling as I had 3 distinct looks for my functions- the Mehendi, the cocktails and the wedding of course! Working with the Matrix experts made me learn so many new things about my hair and this time I decided to document the entire journey with visuals and a video as well.  I learned about the hair color palettes like never before - say if you are inspired by the ornate or goldens then shades from Matrix India’s SoColor’s Gold palette would help you put together a look just like the Maharani bride. For someone who’s having a garden wedding, then shades from the Red palette would complement the décor as well as your look. For a beach bride (and my favourite), the color palettes from the Plum family would do wonders to your overall look. Once we decided to go with the Boho Beach Bride look, they choose the shade- 6.28 for me and a process that lasted for over 4 hours was worth every minute.Only trust the experts especially when it comes to your hair for your big day. Make sure to style your hair with the Style Link products by Matrix such as- Smooth Setter Crème, Heat Buffer Thermal Styling Spray, Style Fixer Hair Spray, Volume Builder Mousse and more. Post color hair care is just as important. To maintain the vibrancy of the salon hair color, use Biolage Colorlast range of haircare daily.Get more details and hair color inspiration on Matrix India’s Facebook page here!Fashion weeks for me are perfect occasions to meet colleagues, artists, designers, and people from the fraternity that contribute to the overall success of the 5-day long celebrations. This year too witnessed mad rush from one designer showcase to the other; launch parties, sneaking in a cup o latte in between and endless conversations with people who eat, live and breathe fashion. Even though I had been hustling hard since last 4 days, Day 5 was pretty easy and effortless. I had been waiting to attend the finale show that was conceptualized by the Amazon Fashion team, which also brought in a prêt-à-porter collection featuring various designers on the runway whose collections could then be purchased with just a click.Fashion weeks for me are perfect occasions to meet colleagues, artists, designers, and people from the fraternity that contribute to the overall success of the 5-day long celebrations.

I had been waiting to attend the finale show that was conceptualized by the Amazon Fashion team, which also brought in a prêt-à-porter collection featuring various designers on the runway whose collections could then be purchased with just a click.Fashion weeks for me are perfect occasions to meet colleagues, artists, designers, and people from the fraternity that contribute to the overall success of the 5-day long celebrations.

Before I even begin to share details about the amazing grand finale show, I want to share my OOTD of the day, which was an unequivocally playful dress by Pankaj and Nidhi. Wearing this dress just made me reminisce days where ingenious makeup and big hairdos didn’t really exist, where the clothes were a true representation of one’s personality. Fashion weeks for me are perfect occasions to meet colleagues, artists, designers, and people from the fraternity that contribute to the overall success of the 5-day long celebrations.

You can now immediately indulge in a great shopping experience courtesy Amazon Fashion’s See Now Buy Now initiative.From being shoppable to curating the best of designers all at once, the two-phased AIFW SS18 Grand Finale saw Prêt and Couture come together on the same ramp at the 30th edition of FDCI’s India Fashion Week. Amazon Fashion collaborated with its finale designers and presented the prêt-à-porter collection that is available to shop with a single click on the Amazon India website. For their ‘See Now Buy Now’ festive collection, Amazon Fashion got designers Rina Dhaka, Rohit Gandhi & Rahul Khanna, Ashish N Soni, Krishna Mehta and Pankaj & Nidhi. The collections included remarkable silhouettes by Pankaj & Nidhi, block printed, tie-dyed and embroidered fabric by Krishna Mehta, textured jacquards by Ashish N Soni, fluid garments by Rina Dhaka and some clean & crisp drapes with basic style staple by Rohit Gandhi & Rahul Khanna. The highlight for me was the grand festive display by master couturier Suneet Varma marking his 30 years in the fashion industry presenting a line of 37 limited edition ensembles. The theme for his showcase was ‘Garden of Eden’ and we witnessed a mix of traditional motifs with conceptual artworks, drapes, and stunning embellishment. The #AmazonDesignerBoutique is the ‘it’ place to shop and discover designers for your go-to and occasion specific fashion needs. This designer boutique on Amazon.in brings in great accessibility and an exhilarating shopping experience starring over 50 designers, all under one roof.  I always wanted to do a Saree at the Fashion Week and am so happy that this year it finally happened courtesy the #AmazonDesignerBoutiue. Having Amazon Fashion, as my official fashion partner for the fashion week has been both ecstatic and so valuable that I can’t even begin to tell!

The day started with the launch of an all-new collection by GAP India which was then followed by a Mogra themed party by the brand Rheson. Sonam & Rhea Kapoor's brand Rheson is now available on Amazon Fashion online and am sure that the shoppers will love to explore the brand on the all-new e-store powered by Amazon. I always wanted to do a Saree at the Fashion Week and am so happy that this year it finally happened courtesy the #AmazonDesignerBoutiue.

A traditional woman with a “girl boss” attitude and that’s why I proudly wore a saree by designer Priti Sahni in all its glory. This stunning silk saree in hues of blue complimented my vibe impeccably. For a laid-back fashion week look, I loved to pair this saree’s original blouse that features a contrasting printed pattern. The minimal jewellery might look casual but the statement clutch purse from designer Puneet Gupta amps up the overall style quotient. This clutch purse blends in beautifully on the outfit and at the same time embraces the multi-faceted qualities of a modern Indian woman! And in case you didn’t notice already, I wore a pair of printed Juttis with my saree because comfort comes FTW. You can now shop this look online on Amazon.inThough it's tempting to fall into the all-black-everything habit the moment autumn-winter begins, fashion weeks, on the other hand, continues to inspire me to embrace rainbow year round. This week at the Amazon Fashion Week Spring Summer 18, my eyes have been overwhelmed by the brightness: jackets, dresses in cobalt, and pants in orange colour and more. And so I scored an OOTD idea that brought in a lot of versatility and helped me put 3 bold pieces together from the label Krishna Mehta who is now available on the #AmazonDesignerBoutique. Though it's tempting to fall into the all-black-everything habit the moment autumn-winter begins, fashion weeks, on the other hand, continues to inspire me to embrace rainbow year round.

And so I scored an OOTD idea that brought in a lot of versatility and helped me put 3 bold pieces together from the label Krishna Mehta who is now available on the #AmazonDesignerBoutique. I met designer Krishna Mehta at her showcase at the fashion week and loved the way she puts together all her design inspirations. My outfit for the day represents pure fabrics, great choice of colour with a twist of the unexpected. I loved wearing the orange tunic for its very avant-garde and is a great everyday staple. The layer on top is a personal favourite featuring a silhouette that’s quite versatile with a pair of pants that easy, effortless and superbly comfortable. This is a kind of fashion that’s my own particular style- the way I’d dress almost all the times. To add a dash of lemon yellow co,our to my outfit, I added my fav accesory label for the fashion week- a clutch purse by designer Puneet Gupta. Love these quote clutch purses and 'SWAGGER', well it has to be a favourite :) I also did a silver eyeliner with extended wings in black because fashion weeks are all about experimenting with new beauty trends after all, isn't it?

I won't lie, I am an unapologetic lover of the black and whites especially when it comes the style staples. A lot of times it has got to do with the kind of brands you feel an affinity for- the fit, the stitch, the cut and the passion that an outfit brings with itself. The other times, monochromes become my go-to color that always seems to work for me in terms of fashion. This outfit from the #AmazonDesignerBoutique is one of my most favourite looks for the season. It's a fundamental need to update our wardrobes as we enter a brand new season of fashion week!

I paired the monochrome ensemble with a drool-worthy clutch purse by designer Puneet Gupta to add a hint of colour to the outfit.

Oh and yes, you do stand a chance to win the new handset for your own self too :)I love the saree for it adds an understated elegance that no other outfit can ever compete with. From handloom fabrics, luxe embroidered sheers and electric prints, the six yards of elegance is constantly being re-imagined to suit every woman’s style & taste. I personally feel that sarees are a great way of playing the #fetsiveseasondressup. Starting with Rakshabandhan to festive season exhibitions and popups, It’s time to update your wardrobe with some accessories that go well with your saree and help you experiment a new style altogether. I am wearing a stunning pastel colour saree from label Asha Gautam (I had also worn another saree from their collection for a destination wedding) and I have teamed up my saree with a stylish crop top (again from Asha Gauatm) and a waist belt from designer Ridhima Bhasin’s collection. I have ditched the heels and paired a handcrafted jutti from Jutti junction’s festive collection. As far as the jewllery is concered, nothing can beat hand painted earrings from Tanya Anand's Paisleypopshop. Without any further adieu, check out my photo story…No matter what the season looks like, denim has always been a wardrobe essential. The denim skirts are back in style and while a lot women with my body type will refrain from trying the denim silhouette, I think it's about time we find the right style that works with our body type. I created a new summer ready look, inspired from the sitcoms of the late 80s (read hollywood glam) featuring linens from Marks and Spencer India. This is the kind of outfit that you can absolutely rock on a casual Friday to work or simply sport it for a summer brunch. No matter what the season looks like, denim has always been a wardrobe essential.

For my trousseau, I also didn’t shy away from adding heritage weaves in form of jackets, ethnic skirts and more. Preserving the sanctity of the age old handlooms and lending the craft a contemporary appeal is the new way forward for this fashion plot. I have collaborated with label Asha Gautam to showcase a destination wedding ready outfit that has both home-grown craftsmanship and opulence that any woman needs in her life. Also, I am listing out ways to wear a lightweight benarasi lehenga to all wedding occasions this season.Across the wedding shopping market there is a new Benarasi narrative that has hit the right chord with the brides and wedding shoppers.

Also, I am listing out ways to wear a lightweight benarasi lehenga to all wedding occasions this season.#1 Give importance to colour combinationsA lot of people don’t wear benarasi or have apprehensions with the fabric for they feel that it does not romance their age. This is where you must lay emphasis on the colour combinations that you choose. For bright summer weddings avoid jewel tones or take them in combinations with pastel shades.#2 Originality In Dupatta Don’t ditch the benarasi dupatta for a net dupatta unless you just don’t want to carry the weaves with you. After creating a couple of combinations, I have realized that nothing looks as regal than a pure benarasi dupatta on a lehenga.#3 Wear statement jewelleryYou must have read and heard this word ‘statement’ but all I intend to say is that pick pieces that you think will stand out and not blend in. These can be small jewelry pieces, statement maang tika or a raani haar. Deck up your weaves with baubles just how you would deck up any other wedding outfit.#5 DetailsThe kind of weaves on your benarasi skirt also work with different body types. Pick patterns that you know will work with your structure. For say an all over woven design on the skirt will help you not look super fuller especially if you are broad. Also, opt for oodles of latkans, lehenga accessories to your outfit to make it look more playful.#6 Pair New Makeup TrendsI did metallic lipstick and I am so happy with the way it turned out in these photos. With these handlooms, you too can try new makeup trends that will add the vision of ‘India-modern’ to out look!This stunning outfit is from the house of Asha Gautam, Defence Colony. The beautiful jewellery is by Tanya Anand, Paisleypop. Indian weddings have been all about the big flared lehengas, layers of jewllery, tons of makeup and chaos. While we can’t really edit the chaotic vibes they offer, its time we embrace our handlooms and hand crafted jewels with utmost pride. With resurgence of antique weaves and traditions I am going to share my vision of ‘how to dress up’ for weddings in 2017. Indian weddings have been all about the big flared lehengas, layers of jewllery, tons of makeup and chaos.

With resurgence of antique weaves and traditions I am going to share my vision of ‘how to dress up’ for weddings in 2017. The sari as a garment is so versatile that it actually gives the wearer the freedom to drape it however they want. When a rich fabric like benarsi is taken into consideration in ones trousseau, it speaks a lot about the woman’s legacy & her taste. When paired right with not so usual jewellery- you create a timeless yet winning combination.  Indian weddings have been all about the big flared lehengas, layers of jewllery, tons of makeup and chaos.

These RedTape white shoes feature a really cute floral pattern that has made it my favorites list already. Guess its time to move away from minimalism to a bit more vigorous vibe this summer! Layering can help you bring out your inner style creative by making you work with pieces in a really bewildering ways. With so many newer combinations, no outfit will ever look the same ☺All photos by Megha Jain.A pair of heels can change your whole life, and take you to place you never been to.View on PinterestA pair of heels can change your whole life, and take you to place you never been to.View on PinterestWedding or no wedding, we bring you list of sexy shoes that will never let you down and is every girls dream.

This campaign has given me an opportunity to feel blessed for what I have, to celebrate our first Valentine’s Day together and reminisce our good times. From recalling our long-distance courtship period to learning finer details about each other while we travel together, I have been sharing it all with my readers with the hashtag #FlightofLove. Romance and travel go hand in hand, and that’s why I was really excited to learn about the British Airways #FlightofLove BA142 that will fly on Valentine’s Day from Delhi to London. British Airways is just the perfect travel partner for a special occasion, isn’t it?As for my #FlightofLove, It happened long before the actual engagement ceremony when my soldier husband decided to take a flight on New Year’s Eve to meet me. To my surprise, what I thought was going to be just him joining me for the celebrations, turned out to be a full-fledged wedding proposal! He took me for a long drive and started telling me how right he thought we were for each other. While I was still soaking in all the sweet things he was saying, he parked the car below a beautifully lit tunnel, got down on his knees and proposed. I couldn’t help but scream out an emotional “YES!”London is high up there on our ‘bucket list’ of cities to visit and the idea of the city in itself inspires me to relive my wedding proposal! I want it to be right in front of the illuminated London Eye, while I gaze at the capital's skyline with a glass of bubbly in my hand! Wouldn’t that just be lovely?

I now realize that the way we spend our time defines who we really are. Weddings aren’t just a milestone in one’s lifetime but your relationship or rather the new role teaches you so much more about time and its value. As cliché as it may sound, time goes by faster than you imagine and I am enjoying every bit of being a wife, taking responsibility of our house, changing sheets, cooking and above all blogging from a new space! I have decided to play with my wedding wardrobe as much as I can and use some of the statement pieces to create new outfit posts this year.

Here’s my first one from the lot ☺Being the younger child, I have been (more) fortunate to live with my parents for the longest and while they had always taken onus for everything even until I was engaged, marriage really does change you. It teaches you time management, selflessness and the art of multi tasking. I’d be lying if I said I could pull it off easily because NO I haven’t and I am still trying. Time has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters hence I have been working of daily planning (something that I never thought of until 25 years), things to do that by the way also includes my grocery, meal plans and taking time out for our families every single day. I insist that you carry a beautiful timepiece with you that not only help you in keeping track of things but also add to your personality as a statement accessory. Casio Sheen has been in my vanity for over a year and every time I feel low, it reminds me that even miracles take a little time. Stylish yet superbly elegant, this watch can help you transform your look from day to night and compliments just any ensemble. I paired it up with a Fab India Kurta dress and together it makes for a sweet symphony!

Though we know it doesn't happen every time but you need to get yourself ready with these special occasion dresses to show off your fashion quotient.- The high style leather jackets, shoes that are in vogue, we should always keep them in our closet to look our best.- And those clothes that have some sentimental value attached to it, like your dadi or nani saree that they gave you out of love. After all there are some staples that have emotional values too.View on PinterestWhat to say Buhbye to?Once you have decided what items you are going to keep, now it's time to sort your pile a little more by saying buhbye to those you don't need anymore.- Say bye to those items you haven't worn in past 6 months, believe me if you think you will wear it soon, you will not and you know it.- Don't keep those items that no longer fit you or is too loose because there is no point in keeping it in your wardrobe.- Overly used tees, yes please just throw it away, because you really have worn it for so long that the item itself wants some rest.View on PinterestHow to organize your wardrobe?Ok!

Whether you are a Bon Jovi girl or a Coldplay fan, I have covered an outfit for you that is concert appropriate (in India at-least) and looks just as casual as the event scene. The only few things that I did consider while putting together an outfit is that a concert ready outfit should aid movement to your body for dancing and having a great time, from being able to jump around the places and if the concert is in the open grounds or stadium arena then help you keep safe and yet look your stylish best. Well before you begin to scroll down on my OOTD just take my advice and invest in timepieces that will help you track your evening but are also statement making.

Casio India's SHEEN collection is one to look out for and the watch that you see me sport fits the whole concert vibe like how!Honestly, if you ask me then there is a hugeeeee difference between dressing up for a concert in  an outdoor location and having a ball at a dance party in a club. Concerts in India involve lots of walking through areas that are uneven and I can tell you this from my experience of attending lots of International and Indian artists performing in Delhi-NCR. Avoid wearing any type of heel in Capitals— not only are they impractical, but you'll also feel extremely tired moving around in those. With Coldplay concert happening in November along with major events in my life- I just can't wait for this month to happen already!

A solid coloured t-shirt is an effortless way to style your denims and you must carry a cover up or a plaid shirt to layer yourself up if required or wear it around the waist just like the 90s style. A choker takes me back to the Spice Girls Era and I love how it works well with the concert OOTD. The outfit is always complete with a statement watch and Casio Sheen collection's all black mineral glass finish watch embedded with cut glass crystals all around the bezel makes for a great concert outfit accessory.  Love the Swarovski elements embedded in the watch and yes you can take a look at it Here.With Coldplay concert happening in November along with major events in my life- I just can't wait for this month to happen already!

It’s elegant, wearable and trendsetting. Move away from the usual lehegna cholis and try a more diverse outfit from our very existing homegrown design houses.  The colour works perfectly for a day function and the embroidery is extravagant yet understated. I have finished the look with jewels by @raabtabyrahul & a statement clutch by@beaumondeaccessories that marries this dreamy ensemble like no other.The three-day Bridal Asia event will offer the finest collection of every conceivable article for prospective brides, grooms and their entourage starting 1st October until 3rd October. Follow me on Instagram for the cocktail and wedding looks!Before writing this post I do want to acknowledge that all offices are different, and that casual Fridays are relevant at some work places only. At Guiltybytes HQ, casual Fridays get a little serious since we line up lots of brand meetings on this day. Everyone’s got his or her own sense of style but I feel that “Casual Friday Dressing” should reflect a relaxed environment at work and yet nit be boring. I have been advocating how Casio India’s Sheen collection seamlessly compliments the modern woman’s style and that’s why the only accessories I chose to wear today is a statement watch. Stay tuned until the end for some tips that you can follow flawlessly.  First things first, have you had a chance to follow my #ShaadiDiaries on Popxo.com yet?

I am sharing my journey of becoming a bride with these awesome folks and you can get details on my leheng shopping, trousseue, makeup and more here. The latest story showcases my trousseue and I have also shared so pro tips for a 20 something bride. As a bride-to- be, I was awaiting wedding shopping and putting together a trousseau that I would cherish for life. More than the purpose, I love this experience for it involves so many emotions and it only strengthens a bride’s relationship, especially with her mother. There are certain things without which a bride’s trousseau is incomplete and today, I am going to share some tips on trousseau shopping for a 20-something bride and my personal favourites. From the start I knew that I wanted some key Indian outfits (I am marrying an Army Officer) for all occasions. I made a list of suits, sarees, Indo-western ensembles and the styles that I wanted to don post wedding. We picked a myriad of suits and I would recommend buying diverse styles like A-lines, anarkalis, straight cut, jacket styles, kaftans and more. I picked up some from Frontier Raas, Meena Bazaar, Fab India and designers like Dheeru and Nitika at Saket. Dheeru and Nitika are doing some bespoke hand embroidered pieces for me that even includes statement dupattas to go with solid coloured suits. Abhinav Mishra DesignI do recommend checking out Shahpur Jat and designers like Abhinav Mishra for some fun and quirky prints. For your Banarasi dose, do not forget to visit Asha Gautam in Defence Colony. Unlike the suits, sarees were more on intuition and I picked up everything that I liked. Nallis at South Ex houses some of the best silk sarees and I have also added some gorgeous chanderi sarees from Raw Mango to my trunk as I am going to get ample opportunities to don the six yard as an Army wife. Designer Asha Gautam’s Collection Designer Ritu Kumar’s saree collection is just as grand as lehengas done by her. The store at South Ex is a must visit as you even get to explore Label Ritu Kumar, a brand for your everyday street fashion fix. As for the saree blouses, mom and I decided to ditch blouse stitching for every single saree and instead picked up some basic blouses from GK-1, M block market. If you are in Delhi then pay a visit to the famous ‘blouse wali gali’, Eves tailor and a store called as The Goldy’s Nest (they house some of the best gota patti blouses, skirts, suits etc).

But trousseau has just given me an opportunity to streamline my existing collection and add some party clutches to the line. I have shopped for a lot of neutral bags from ALDO and Charles & Keith that have plenty of storage space and will compliment most of my casual daywear.

You can play with the styles of the clutch purse and opt for some potli styles too. Versatile jewellery collectionChoosing the perfect bridal jewellery that will make one look like a royalty is every girl’s dream! But it is just as important to invest in pieces that you will adorn when the wedding celebrations are over. Often the standout piece in an outfit, diamond jewels can evoke heirloom passion, and that’s why I absolutely recommend investing in diamond jewellery such as earrings and necklaces for the new-age brides. I started by reading and researching before visiting different stores. Having prior knowledge about the stones, diamonds and metal gave me a fair idea of the budget and the style preference. What I did realize was that you can buy much more jewellery with thorough planning. For my wedding I got myself a beautiful Polki set to go with my gota patti lehenga. Just remember that getting your neckline style on point can add character to your wedding outfit or even highlight a unique feature. For instance if you have a sweetheart neckline then skip the necklace and maybe focus on a pair of chandelier earrings. A V-neckline can be accessorized with a choker or a pendant for a little décolletage decoration and more. I also decided to experiment with detachable jewellery and multipurpose jewels and recommend all brides to visit Tanishq store for jewels that can be worn together and as stand-alone pieces too. Another must have are a pair of earrings that transition from modern to traditional easily. Gold earrings never go out of fashion, hence don’t forget to invest in a suitable pair. First things first, have you had a chance to follow my #ShaadiDiaries on Popxo.com yet? I am sharing my journey of becoming a bride with these awesome folks and you can get details on my leheng shopping, trousseue, makeup and more here. The latest story showcases my trousseue and I have also shared so pro tips for a 20 something bride. As a bride-to- be, I was awaiting wedding shopping and putting together a trousseau that I would cherish for life. More than the purpose, I love this experience for it involves so many emotions and it only strengthens a bride’s relationship, especially with her mother. There are certain things without which a bride’s trousseau is incomplete and today, I am going to share some tips on trousseau shopping for a 20-something bride and my personal favourites. From the start I knew that I wanted some key Indian outfits (I am marrying an Army Officer) for all occasions. I made a list of suits, sarees, Indo-western ensembles and the styles that I wanted to don post wedding. We picked a myriad of suits and I would recommend buying diverse styles like A-lines, anarkalis, straight cut, jacket styles, kaftans and more. I picked up some from Frontier Raas, Meena Bazaar, Fab India and designers like Dheeru and Nitika at Saket. Dheeru and Nitika are doing some bespoke hand embroidered pieces for me that even includes statement dupattas to go with solid coloured suits. Abhinav Mishra DesignI do recommend checking out Shahpur Jat and designers like Abhinav Mishra for some fun and quirky prints. For your Banarasi dose, do not forget to visit Asha Gautam in Defence Colony. Unlike the suits, sarees were more on intuition and I picked up everything that I liked. Nallis at South Ex houses some of the best silk sarees and I have also added some gorgeous chanderi sarees from Raw Mango to my trunk as I am going to get ample opportunities to don the six yard as an Army wife. Designer Asha Gautam’s Collection Designer Ritu Kumar’s saree collection is just as grand as lehengas done by her. The store at South Ex is a must visit as you even get to explore Label Ritu Kumar, a brand for your everyday street fashion fix. As for the saree blouses, mom and I decided to ditch blouse stitching for every single saree and instead picked up some basic blouses from GK-1, M block market. If you are in Delhi then pay a visit to the famous ‘blouse wali gali’, Eves tailor and a store called as The Goldy’s Nest (they house some of the best gota patti blouses, skirts, suits etc). Marrying into a Punjabi family, I also picked up some beautiful Phulkari dupattas online. Designer Anu P.D based out of Hauz Khas is doing some versatile saree accessories for me and that’s something that I recommend to all new-age brides. These versatile separates not only add glam but are also head turning pieces that compliment the Indian attire to perfection. You can check out her store for more. Bags and clutchesHonestly, I have been collecting bags since much before I decided to get married. But trousseau has just given me an opportunity to streamline my existing collection and add some party clutches to the line. I have shopped for a lot of neutral bags from ALDO and Charles & Keith that have plenty of storage space and will compliment most of my casual daywear. For handcrafted handbags I also recommend brides to check out brands like Pratinava, Taws and Poem Bags. The clutch collection is my favourite and I picked up my gorgeous, hand embroidered bridal clutches from RuSaru. I also found solid coloured clutches at great prices on Stalkbuylove. If you don’t want to exceed your budget then get party clutches in black, silver, golden and copper that will pretty much cover all your Indian wear. You can play with the styles of the clutch purse and opt for some potli styles too. Versatile jewellery collectionChoosing the perfect bridal jewellery that will make one look like a royalty is every girl’s dream!

For other occasions like mehendi and sangeet, I have shopped for gold plated jewellery from Zariin and some silver rings from Amrapali. First things first, have you had a chance to follow my #ShaadiDiaries on Popxo.com yet?
