			 Important info for you. What do you think of when I say the word “padlock”—your high school gym locker room? That bridge in France that collapsed because everyone kept hooking little metaphors for their relationships on it? (This is why we can’t have nice things, BTW.)  Anyway, now it’s time to associate jewelry with the term—if you didn’t already—because, just like chunky chain necklaces, lock details are in. Some would even say they’re the fall/winter version of the puka shell craze! Either way, necklaces and earrings with padlocks on them were seen on the runways of designers like Tom Ford, and they’ve now made their way to the mainstream, landing at all your fave online retailers. Not sure how you feel about padlocks on jewelry? Peruse the lil curated list of cuties, below, to get a nice sense for what’s out there. Then, because you’ll ultimately be on board, shop with me because I hate being alone and also I want us both to be fashionable.

			 Honestly, why couldn’t this show have gone on forever? Alas, it has been months since everyone’s favorite HBO fantasy series ended and somehow we still don’t have that last George R. R. Martin book in our hands? That being said, some of you are still obsessed with Game of Thrones, and I certainly don’t blame you.  So, whether you want to play out your deepest alternate-ending fantasies, want to resurrect some of your faves who were tragically gone too soon, are waiting patiently for the prequels, or just love GoT and can’t wait to dress like characters from the show for Halloween, this list of costume ideas has you covered. Valar morghulis. Note: Light series-ending spoilers below. If you haven’t finished GoT, first, who are you? Second, beware. 
  Not all of them lasted to the end of the series, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t get your love and support in costume form. Show your adoration for these lorge pups in the form of a full-on onesie... ...or just a mask with a semi-blank stare, because why not. From baby Khaleesi Dany... ...to dragon-flying Mad Queen Dany. Pick your poison.  Also, there’s this version of Dany actually riding an inflatable dragon, which is perfect in every way.   All those early hairstyles are way too complicated to attempt, so I’d stick with costumes from the final couple seasons.   Night King killaaa!   Sexy Jon is the only Jon I recognize.   Get yourself this mask. Then top it off with this getup. Then do the arm thing and bring all your friends back from the dead.   How warm will you be on Halloween night when you’re bundled up in this amazing cloak? The night is dark and full of potential frostbite, but not for you.   If you want to be more cuddly, go with this guy for sure.

			 Dang, these are B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L.  If you’re in need of a new go-to handbag, look no further than the fall/winter runways, duh. You’ll totally impress your friends with the latest trends if you snag these gorge bags fast—or at least before the beginning of winter rolls around. From shearling to geometric shapes to croc-embossed materials, everyone will ask, “Wait, where did you buy that?!” Here, 13 of winter’s biggest trends that you’ll want to add to your cart ASAP. This winter’s shearling trend, seen here on this Chanel fanny pack, will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside (and out).  Chanel A cute crossbody isn’t so basic when it’s covered in this texture. This faux-shearling-trimmed tote is perfect to bring to yoga or while running errands. Plus, it’s made from environmentally conscious materials. This take on the shearling trend is super glam thanks to its structured gold handle. Croc-embossed leather is definitely Instagram bait. For a high-end look, try the trend in structured silhouettes. Max Mara This ’90s-inspired bag shape is back and even better in croc. Also great news? This version is under $100. If you want to be an accessories influencer, splurge on Staud. This croc-embossed, angular bag in brown is practically a work of art. This new modern bag shape by Parisa Wang is so elevated with the gold-accented buckle. Yes, they might be hard to open and close, but damn, do they look chic. (And hey, at least you know your things are safe, right?)  Oscar de la Renta The shape of this bag looks so elegant, but surprise! It’s actually way under $100. This luxe option comes with a gold closure that almost resembles jewelry. Try this belt bag in a fun color palette. The locks are sleek, and you can fit your phone, lipstick, and debit cards hands-free. These bold, graphic, and geometric-shaped purses, seen here on the runway in Paris, are a perfect way to update your boring ol’ evening bag.  Paco Rabanne This heart-shaped clutch is surprisingly elegant considering the price tag. Take it with you on a fancy dinner as a fun accessory. This cute lil purse is perfect for holding just the essentials. It’s available in three dark winter colors with a chic fringe tassel on the bottom. If you really want to go mini, try a bracelet pouch like this sleek round one. The coin purse, also known as a “kisslock clutch,” got a modern update during Fashion Week thanks to different bold hues and prints.  Balenciaga A burgundy design with croc-embossed texture is two trends in one, y’all. This bright-yellow coin purse has a chic chain strap, perfect for a night out. This Coach kisslock clutch is made from buttery-soft leather and will brighten up any winter look. Checks, plaids, and graphic prints are I-N, like this version that appeared at the Louis Vuitton show.  Louis Vuitton Keep the pattern monochromatic in two shades of brown. This faux-pearl version is a gorgeous take on the trend. This cute cube shape is black and white on the outside but has colorful lining on the inside. Inspired by your grandma’s purse but not as outdated, the quilted bag got a fresh makeover on the catwalks.  Tibi Carry your phone, but make it fashion, amirite? This bold red V-quilted bag definitely makes a statement. Try this glossy leather bag by Rebecca Minkoff for an eye-catching accessory. Adorned straps with beads, spheres, tassels, chains, and more definitely made an impact this season.  Ulla Johnson You’ve probs seen this bag from By Far on all your fave influencers. This version in hunter green is super chic for the winter months.

			 You will hardly recognize the retail giant's two new labels. ALERT: Shopping at Target just got way better.

			 Yes, it’s THAT time of year again.   There’s nothing like a leather jacket to get you in the fall mood. It is a staple for transitional weather and also happens to look hella cool on everyone?! And there are SO many ways to wear it. You can commit to the edgy theme and go with an all-black ensemble, keep it low-key with jeans, dress it up with skirts or, well, a literal dress. Here, 18 leather jacket outfits that’ll give you some serious styling inspo for the new season.  Contrast the edginess of a moto with a fuzzy light-pink top and floral-printed skirt. So cozy!  Go all out with head-to-toe animal print (or wear the jacket separately with something else), then slide your feet into a pair of knee-high white boots—and prepare to turn heads.  In a rut? Coordinating sets, like this beige jacket and zip skirt combo, are an easy go-to outfit to throw on with black boots if you don’t want to think too hard—plus, it looks pretty amazing, right?  Not all leather jackets are black, ya know. A burgundy one adds a pop of color to a leather mini and black combat boots. Keep this one open or belt it for those chillier days.  If it’s got a lot of pretty zipper details, show ’em off by closing the jacket. With black jeans and sneakers, it’s effortlessly chic.  Shearling trim adds contrast while super skinny jeans and suede boots keep you looking sleek ‘n’ simple.  Snakeskin-patterned jackets like this one are v on trend and also happen to go with everything, like charcoal-colored denim and white heels, because of the neutral colors.  A white leather jacket will definitely get all the compliments. Make it the real focal point by keeping the rest of your ’fit—blue jeans and kicks—minimal.   Update your closet this fall with a patent PU leather bomber that easily pairs with anything—like a graphic tee and ripped roll-up jeans.  The extra shine definitely makes it a standout.  Speaking of animal prints, these leopard-print pants really take a basic jacket to a whole other level. Complete the look with pointy-toe slingbacks and you’ve got an outfit you can wear to the office—and to those happy hour drinks.   There are leather jackets and then there are shackets—i.e., a shirt jacket. Wear this one as outerwear over a plaid shirt and a checkered knit skirt or on its own buttoned up all the way.   A faux leather peplum jacket works great as a work staple for cooler weather. Keep it modern with a belted tiered minidress and studded mid-heel mules.  REALLY into the animal-print trend? Get it on your pants, too, for an even more eye-catching ensemble.  A faux leather blazer is a chic upgrade to your everyday leather jacket. Paired with an oh-so-trendy leopard midi skirt and black combat boots, this ’fit goes to the next level.  Opt for a bold red hue that stands out from your jeans and black accessories. If it’s not quite so cold yet, wear it open with a bra top for a no-fuss but sexy going-out look.  Not all leather jackets have that moto vibe. Take this faux-leather puffer, for instance. It makes the silhouette look super luxe—while keeping you warm. Throw on some coordinating high-waisted faux leather leggings to complete the all-black theme.  Step out in a flirty floral pattern sheer bodysuit for your next girls’ night out. A simple pair of great-fitting jeans and lizard-embossed vegan leather jacket makes gives this that “off-duty model” aesthetic. Offset the solid colors of a wine-colored jacket and coordinating skirt with an embellished striped sweater. Add a pair of embroidered boots that hit right at mid-calf if you’re into the whole Western thing.

			 Would you wear one? Miami Swim Week is currently underway, and, as you can imagine, it includes a lot of sexy fashion shows. Right now, I'm here to talk about just one, because it has left me with so many unanswered questions.  Here are the relevant details: On Monday, photographer and self-professed "King of Tape," Joel Alvarez, debuted a line of swimwear called The Black Tape Project. The catwalk featured very skimpy—and by that I mean truly almost nude—designs made of metallic, mosaic-like tape tiles. Yes, I said TAPE, and yes, this is wild and you just have to see it for yourself: So let's get to it: Like, how long did it take to apply this much tape to this many women? This is awk, and I'm sorry, but what's going on down there? Is it a tape-to-skin situation, or is there something else between the skin and the adhesive? I need to know. Speaking of the adhesive, is it painful to take off? Especially in all these very sensitive places? WHAT DO THESE TAN LINES LOOK LIKE???? Actually, there's an answer to that question:  Cool sun tan result to being in the sun while in the tape #blacktapeproject A post shared by  father of dragons (@thekingoftape) on Feb 25, 2018 at 7:21am PST Last question: Would these "bikinis" really stay on in the water??

			 It's not everybody's favorite night, OK? Everyone makes a big deal out of the ultra-exclusive Met Gala: Only the most A-list celebs get an invite to the annual fundraiser at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they show off their OTT ensembles on the red carpet. But these five stars are so over it — and (most of them) have pretty much vowed to never return. Despite showing up very on-theme for his very first (and only) Met Gala in 2016 alongside his on-again-off-again GF Gigi Hadid, Zayn Malik is not a fan of the event.  In 2018, the singer told GQ that he thought the event was "self-indulgent" and admitted he would "rather be sitting at my house, doing something productive, than dressing up in really expensive clothes and being photographed on a red carpet." One day after her first Met Gala, Demi posted an awkward photo to Instagram of herself standing to the side of designer Jeremy Scott and Nicki Minaj, writing, "This picture pretty much summed up my first and probably last met. #cool #sofuckingawkward #notforme #sweatpants #forensicfiles #whatsgood." Almost two years later, she expanded on why she'd most likely never be back in an interview with Billboard: "This one celebrity was a complete bitch and was miserable to be around. It was very cliquey. I remember being so uncomfortable that I wanted to drink." As soon as she could, Demi, who has famously opened up about her journey to sobriety, says she went to an AA meeting. She still had some of her accessories from the event on. "I changed my clothes, but I still had my diamonds on — millions of dollars of diamonds on in an AA meeting. And I related more to the homeless people in that meeting who struggled with the same struggles that I deal with than the people at the Met Gala — fake and sucking the fashion industry's dick." After her first — and likely last — Met Gala experience in 2016, Amy told Howard Stern that attending the annual event "felt like a punishment ... I left the second I could. I left earlier than I should have been allowed ... It's people doing an impression of having a conversation ... I don't like the farce." She added, "We're dressed up like a bunch of fucking assholes." Gwyneth had such a bad time at the 2013 Met Gala that she told USA Today, "I'm never going again. It was so un-fun. It was boiling. It was too crowded. I did not enjoy it at all." She may have had enough time to heal, though, as she did, in fact, attend the event in 2017. She even posted a throwback picture of her very first Met experience on Instagram to express just how excited she was to be back: "My first ever Met Ball in 1995. #calvinklein #fullcirclemomentcomingup." Tina wasn't excited about her 2010 Met Gala, later telling David Letterman on The Late Show, that it was "such a jerk parade ... if you had a million arms and all the people you would punch in the whole world, they were all there."  The Project Runway host has a long-running feud with the mastermind behind the event, Anna Wintour, so he's been  "disinvited" for life. Way harsh. "I was asked what is the most unforgettable thing I've ever seen in fashion," he said on E!'s Fashion Police, "and I said, 'It's easy. It was watching Anna Wintour being carried down five flights of stairs by two bodyguards — to big hulking men — from a fashion show ... All hell broke loose ... It was insane. We've had an open war ever since."

			 It sold out 25 (!) times in a single year. Listen, guys: We know a great swimsuit when we see one. Whether it’s a cult-favorite $25 one-piece with more than 1,600 five-star reviews on Amazon or a bikini that actually supports the girls, we have a knack for scoping out grade-A bathing suits. However, it doesn’t take an expert to see that Summersalt’s best-selling Sidestroke one-shouldered swimsuit is amazing—the style literally sold out 25 times within its first year of sale. The waiting list for the suit is regularly filled with thousands of eager would-be buyers, and nearly 200 reviewers have given the suit a perfect five stars. Luckily, it’s finally back in stock, just in time for the Fourth of July.  What makes this bathing suit so special? Summersalt is a direct-to-consumer swimwear company that offers “the best designer quality at the best price,” which means that none of the suits will set you back more than $100. While Summersalt suits are not Amazon-cheap, they’re also better than Amazon quality (sorry, it’s true!). The company claims the UPF 50+ fabric is five times stronger and has four times the compression of ordinary swimwear for a softer yet more durable suit (magic!). You can also expect a superior fit, thanks to 1.5 million body measurements taken from 10,000 women that inform the fit. Sangria & Dragonfruit & White Sand Blue Lagoon & Pacific & White Sand White Sand White Sand & Stingray & Deep Sea Sea Urchin Lava & Hibiscus & White Sand White Sand & Mango & Deep Sea Deep Sea The Sidestroke is crazy-popular because the brand claims it is built to move with you but stays in place where you need it most. That means you won’t get wedgies from taking a few steps or have to avoid bending over for fear of indecent exposure. Reviewers say the claims are legit: “I like how comfortable I feel in it. I’m not constantly pulling and adjusting it,” says one, while another raves, “I am never worried about a nip slip in this suit.” The suit comes in sizes 2 to 24, in more than nine colors, with varying booty coverage, depending on your preference. Summersalt has also adapted the super-popular style into a bikini too. Above are some of our favorite colors—good luck choosing just one!

			 SO. Pretty.  Sure, maybe it’s no secret that jewelry is a fun way to make your style feel fresh. And while I’ll always have room in my heart for statement earrings and all the necklaces in the world, rings have become the most important part of my jewelry collection recently. That’s mainly because there are so many types of rings. Truly. SO many.  Especially when talking about “fashion” rings—which is to say, not engagement rings but the kind you can buy and wear every damn day. There are birthstone rings, statement rings, stacking rings—and even mood rings.  You can wear as many types of rings at the same time as you could possibly want, by the way. Or as few. Pile a ton on one finger, separate them, mix metals...the jewelry world is your oyster. Get started by learning the array of rings available for you to choose from, below. A tubular, rounded piece in gold or silver will seriously upgrade any ring party you have. These pair particularly well with thick, juicy hoop earrings, like the ones the model wears here.  Don’t be afraid to venture into text-heavy rings. Short words are a great way to show off something you love—like tacos—without having to say much. Wear it loud and proud every damn day. The signet part of the ring is the seal stamped in the middle, which can be anything—something super meaningful, if you like, or something just for fun.  Remember when birthstone jewelry was...the most important accessory you could buy? Well, nothing’s changed, btw. This one combines the birthstone with a delicate chain ring for an updated version of the look.  When considering a new ring to add to your plentiful stacks, it’s always fun to find a band that has a little something extra going on. Enter the braided band. A quirky cocktail ring is nothing if not a conversation starter. Wear this horse-themed one to your next party and see what I mean. You know when a jewelry piece just has that je ne sais quoi that gets you all the compliments? Yeah, you can typically chock that up to it being asymmetrical and delicate. Okay, stacking rings are maybe one of the most important types of rings you could invest in right now. They’re everywhere—and they deserve to be. Getting a pack of these little baubles is fun because they all have a similar theme, but each ring is strong enough to wear on its own too.  Super-thick band rings, also known as cigar rings, are becoming ultra popular. They have a very noticeable effect on their own of course, but they also look unexpectedly stylish as hell stacked with a few thinner rings around them.  Thick, juicy chain necklaces deserve a trendy, ring counterpart, IMO. Although gold and silver metals might be the most popular types of materials used for fashion (aka not fine) jewelry, that doesn’t mean they’re the only ones. Take this gorgeous glass ring, for example. Its raised blue design and extra-thick size makes it really fresh, fun statement with any outfit.  What’s more fun than a lovely gold ring that spirals up your finger like a snake? Nothing, that’s what. Want to be fancy, but not too fancy? Consider sliding on a pearl ring like this one for your next brunch or get-together. This ring isn’t metal, but it is just as precious. Consider a ring made of a mineral component, like jade, when buying your next band. Channel-set rings are ones where the stones inside are all set in a row, with no brackets in between. These ones in baguette-cut shapes form a nice bar across the top of your finger. The best part about this ring, though, is its fun, colorful design. The vibrant lineup makes for a cheerful add-on to literally any colored outfit.  Once you start a ring collection, you’ll also start finding little ways to make each piece feel personalized. The mini moon in this one adds dimension to a ring collection without sacrificing that ever-important stackability ratio.  Flat-top rings are an awesome way to add dimension to a set of  without disrupting the flow. The flat top is fun on its own, but it also serves to make a finger full of rings feel expertly curated.  A pearl ring has the same kind of polished feel that a pearl necklace does, but in a completely fresh way. This one looks especially cool when you wear it with something decidedly unexpected, like a utilitarian button-down.  Did you really think I’d go through tons of important ring types without talking about mood rings? ’Course not. This huuuuge one, in particular, is amazing and I need it.  What could be more fun than a diamond-crusted sunshine ring? Oh right...wearing said ring to a cocktail party and partaking of said cocktails.  Unconventional ring shapes are extremely fun for adding to the top of a stack—especially when that ring shape just so happens to be a crown.  The size of the ring itself makes all the difference in how it lies on your hand. This chain ring is so small that you can barely tell it’s made up of a chain until you’re in hand-holding distance. Wear it on its own for the teeniest detailing or stacked with others for a little extra somethin’-somethin’. Good news: Lockets are alive and well. But they aren’t just for necklaces anymore. The teeny-tiny keepsakes are made for rings too.  There are infinite types of diamonds rings out there, but when it comes to everyday ones, there’s something special about a thin, curved band. It’s the perfect shape to feel more special than a straight band, but it’s not too trendy. Wear it for life, and pass it on.  These fun “jackets” fit neatly over your other stackable rings. They’re a great way to make sure your stack looks cohesive and thoughtful.

			 All hail the street-style (and red-carpet) queen! She’s not 2019 Carla Bruni. She’s not an extension of her older sister Gigi. She’s Bella freakin’ Hadid, and in case you haven’t noticed, she’s literally one of the hottest supermodels in the game right now. Hailed for her dope street style and obsessed over for her chic red-carpet looks, Bella is one of fashion’s brightest stars. And to honor that, we’re taking a look at some of her best looks in honor of her birthday—HBD, Bella! So sit back, relax, and prepare to experience major fashion envy get some serious style inspiration. You are so welcome! You know, if I were to rock a pair of pants with a big fat doodled butterfly on it, I would look like an unfashionable child. But Bella? Bella makes it work.  This layered tulle dress Bella wore to the Cannes Film Festival seriously made her look like a fairy godmother come to life—all she’s missing is a sparkly wand! Bella whipped out her fiercest denim tuxedo for Gigi Hadid’s birthday party in NYC—she wore a killer bustier, Dickies Girl carpenter jeans, a Louis Vuitton bag, and combat boots for the occasion. Bella looked like the textbook definition of a snatched waist in this  stunning red dress she wore to Bulgari’s B.ZERO1 XX Anniversary Global Launch Event in Rome. Bella proved that bundling up in brick NYC winters doesn’t mean you need to look like an actual marshmallow. Leather as insulation? Genius! Who wouldn’t want to look this chic while casually popping into a Michael Kors fashion show? Holy cow, a lot is going on here. Boobs, legs, arms—oh my! Bella pulled out all the stops for the 2018 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show after-party and wore a sexy shimmery, plunging dress for the event. I’m not exactly sure if it was raining on this day of Paris Fashion Week, but Bella donned a Chrome Hearts clear PVC raincoat and matching bucket hat with a white Chanel tank and baggy blue jeans. Honestly, looking this good in rain gear should be a crime. Bella straight-up killed Paris Fashion Week with this off-duty look. This Y/Project organza denim jacket and pant set, Prada bag, and teeny square glasses combo makes her look like the ’90s e-girl I have always aspired to be. Pink! Skirt! Suit! This alone was enough to make me drool over Bella’s outfit, but then she had to go and add a fuzzy T-shirt into the mix. As a bona fide cozy girl, I could not be more in love. Have you got Dior saddlebag fever yet? No? Well, you totally will after peeping Bella’s logo one, which she paired with a navy-blue striped suit set and orange sunnies while out in NYC. PLEASE bury me in something remotely similar to this slinky, drippy, gold Versace concoction of a dress that Bella wore to a Bulgari dinner in Rome. Please. I’m fully convinced I would look like a stumpy banana trying to wear this look, but Bella pulled it off with ease while attending the Dior Homme fashion show in Paris. Bella’s latex Chrome Hearts dress at the 2018 Met Gala is a literal gothic Slip ’N Slide party waiting to happen. Emo me is living! I never thought I would ever want a hot-pink patent-leather blazer in my life, but the one Bella is pictured wearing by Georgine is really making me reconsider. This whole look is cake, and the vintage Chanel chain belt is the icing on top. *files away in Paris outfit inspo* This street-style Paris Fashion Week look that Bella rocked in this pic is E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. The color-blocking! The blazer! The itty-bitty Dior bag! It’s just sooo much look to process.  I’m beyond obsessed with how Bella layered her denim jacket under a black patent-leather blazer—it is so unexpected and feels beyond chic. The Alexander Wang heels and ’90s Balenciaga sunglasses are really just a plus. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Bella Hadid or a scene from The Matrix??  Bella—the correct answer—wore a to-die-for shimmering black trench coat by Ralph Lauren, a black dress, Liudmila lace-up boots, and Roberi & Fraud mini sunglasses while out in Paris. So much fashion, so little time! This red leather coatdress and white go-go boots combo Bella wore in Paris is absolutely stunning and reaaally making me regret not sifting through my grandma’s closet for those go-go boots she has from her ’70s dancer days. I wonder.... Bella might not be a born-and-bred New Yorker, but this city-girl-chic look she wore during a Brooklyn outing is extremely hard-pressed to tell me otherwise. Bella flew out to Dubai to support the newest Bulgari resort and wore a satin Fendi dress with a Versace belt to cinch in her waist. The necklace and clutch? Both Bulgari, duh!  I am such a fan when Bella decides to go bold. Case in point: This shiny ’90s-inspired suit in a shade of candy-apple red is so good, I can’t help but drool. I never look this good strolling NYC at night, but alas, I am no Bella Hadid. This white gown by Roberto Cavalli Couture that Bella wore to a Bulgari event hugs her curves in alllll the right places, and it’ll inspire you to whip out your LWD (little white dress) AFTER Labor Day. Cobalt-blue separates? During OCTOBER? Somehow, this delightful contradiction Bella wore in Paris suits (get it?) her so well that I have zero complaints! If you were to look up the definition of “Parisian chic” in the dictionary, this legit would be the first picture you see! During Paris Fashion Week, Bella wore the cutest leather beret and red hoop earrings with a Claudia Li blazer, biker shorts, and Christian Dior patent-leather heels. Bella wore this velvet corset and pinstripe suit combo while leaving Marc Jacobs’ New York Fashion Week show, and something tells me she was one of the better-dressed models leaving backstage. Juuust a hunch! Would you try approaching Bella in an outfit this fierce? I think not. Sweater over the shoulders = “Don’t even try talking to me, sweetie!” Bella’s Off-White hot-pink blazer just gives me major brunette Barbie vibes, and I am living for it. I mean, how the hell else should a fashion icon show up to the CDFA Fashion Awards? Bella attended the 2017 amFAR Gala in the most delicate dress  I have ever seen in my LIFE. The dress, by René Caovilla, is perfect for the chilliest of ice princesses...or the highest class of supermodels. Bella was clearly feeling sassy when she stepped out in this Clueless-inspired Chrome Hearts x Bella cardigan and pleated leather skirt ensemble while out in London. She’s literally two seconds away from flipping her hair and saying, “As if!” For the 2017 Met Gala after-party, Bella basically said “F*ck it” and showed up in a completely see-through dress and nothing underneath...except for a black panty to cover her lady bits and black tape to cover her areolae. Cheeky AF!

			 Knowledge is power. If you’ve landed on this page, it means you're not sure what type of swimsuit to get and you may even be confused by all the different styles out there. Well, no worries, boo. Below, a comprehensive list of all the kinds of bikinis and one-pieces you may encounter. A bandeau is a strapless top that is straight across. This one has off-the-shoulder sleeve details that are super cute! This term is pretty straight forward, but in case you're still not clear—a bikini top with triangles covering each of your boobs is a triangle top!  A bikini with underwire is one that kinda looks like a bra and offers a bit more lift and support than one without. They can come padded or unpadded, depending on the coverage you want. This kind of bikini is asymmetrical, meaning there's just one strap going over one shoulder, instead of both. Instead of tying your bikini behind your neck and at your back, these ones tie in the front for and easy on-and-off situation! A two-piece top that looks just like a sports bra works well for swimming laps or generally being very active in the water. High-neck suits fit closely to the neck and don't plunge. Take a look at this one here to see what I mean. This cut of suit has a crop top like feel, hitting a little lower on the rib cage than most other bikinis. Rash guards can come in long-sleeve styles or short-sleeve styles and are typically used in sports, like surfing. Nowadays, many people use them instead of or over their regular swim tops to help prevent harmful UV ray damage. Basically, a suit that covers your top and bottom in just one piece versus two pieces. Why not both? Monokinis are a hybrid of one- and two-pieces. They generally have cool cutouts and show lots of skin.  If you're trying to just get your laps going, this is the suit you need. No frills, no muss, just the ability to stay in place and be aerodynamic. This is a silhouette you'd expect to see a surfer wear—something with a mock turtleneck and boyshorts all in one piece. Scuba divers, snorklers, and water-skiers/wakeboarders/what-have-you sporty people also wear variations on this theme, sometimes with pants involved depending on how cold they expect to be.  Now, let's get into bottoms, shall we? Cheeky cuts show a li’l ass, but not too much. Here's an example! This ’80s- and ’90s-style cut typically sits above the hip bone. They make your legs look really long.  Generally, these bottoms hit right at, above, or below the bellybutton. You guessed it—these have strings that tie at the side, which typically function to adjust the size and keep things in place but can also just be fashion details that don't serve any purpose other than looking good. Basically, these look like short shorts that hit just below the curve of one's butt cheeks. They're great for sporty activities, like playing beach volleyball!  Bottoms with this cut are typically curved hipster styles that are lower in the center and higher above the legs. The scoop can be more subtle, like the one here, or more extreme, like you'd expect from ’90s-inspired looks.  If modesty is your priority in a two-piece, this is the style of bottoms you'd most likely want to get. This little detail in the center of many swimsuit bottoms helps create a bubble-butt illusion and can be found in all types of two-pieces, from thongs to full coverage. If showing off that ’donk is a big priority for you, you'll want to wear this style of bottom.

			  Trust the reviews, folks.  In need of some new underwear ASAP? I know that feeling, girl. Here, 16 of the top-rated styles on the internet, whether you’re looking for a comfortable thong, a no-show silhouette, a sexy lace number, or all of the above. These’ll take you from your barre class to Trader Joe’s to a date night and everywhere in between. Aerie’s boybriefs are a mix of a boy short and a brief (get it?), giving you the perfect amount of coverage. And the material really hugs your body for an amazing-feeling fit. Reviewers also say they make your butt look cute, which is why this style has an almost-perfect five-star rating. Another plus? You can buy them in bulk and get 10 of these for $35. High-waisted pants are super comfy, but have you ever tried high-waisted underwear? This Wacoal pair comes in six other shades and has a super-stretchy fabric for a comfy fit. They’re great if you’re looking for more coverage, and to prove it? These have more than 500 reviews and a near-perfect rating. These Calvin briefs are a go-to if you want a retro look (or if you want to channel Kendall Jenner). But they’re not just for Instagram selfies—they are actually SO soft. With more than 700 Amazon reviews, they have an impressive 4.6-star rating. The bottom line? Customers say they are breathable and stay in place. The brand is known for its wide range of bra sizes, and the same rings true with its underwear. Its pima cotton thong is available from XS to 3X, and reviewers say it doesn’t ride up and it fits true to size. This style is also available in three other shades, and you can buy three for $30 if you’re looking to stock up. Amazon actually has tons of great options, including this six-pack of hipsters for less than $25. This set, which comes in other hues, BTW, has a whopping 1,300 reviews and a 4.4-star rating. Just be sure to order a size down since they run large, but once you do that, you’ll love the stretchy fabric, coverage, and minimal design. The Never Say Never thong from Cosabella is one of the brand’s most popular styles because it’s seamless, the wide hip band ensures it stays put, and it still looks sexy with its scalloped lace. It also holds up in the wash and doesn’t tear or shrink. Your butt will never want to take off these Natori briefs. Trust me. The lace trim adds a cute detail, while the cotton fabric doesn’t irritate your skin. Not convinced? Then listen to the 600+ reviewers who gave these a near-perfect rating. They’re THAT good. Negative Underwear is popular among the minimalist crowd, and its mesh thong is no exception. The silky elastic band doesn’t dig into your hips and the mesh fabric keeps things breezy—especially in rising summer temps. If you’re looking for a neutral shade that matches your skin tone, this bikini style is it. It comes in seven shades ranging from light beige to dark brown so you can finally have a pair that blends in with your natural color. These are basically invisible, even under tight clothing, so you can wish your VPL goodbyyye. Hanky Panky is the classic cult panty. This cheeky hipster sits low on the waist and is flattering and sexy with its partial coverage. It’s a good go-to for everyday use—wear it under a flowing dress, cigarette trousers, or even a skirt. This innovative style is an amazing solution when it’s your time of the month. These briefs have a 4.8 rating out of 5 stars with almost 1,500 reviews. Why are they so great? They can absorb up to two tampons’ worth of blood while keeping you dry. Customers also rave over the comfortable fit and the fact that they can wear them stress-free with no leaks. If you just got that promotion and want to splurge on a chic yet comfortable pair, opt for these. The stretch jersey and mid-rise waist will feel heavenly, but the see-through trim keeps it sexy—especially when worn with the matching bra. This cotton design is meant to make you feel like you’re on vacation, thanks to its airy and effortless silhouette. Since it’s not seamless, you’ll want to wear these under flowing dresses or when you’re just lounging around the house, but you’ll be so obsessed with the cozy bloomer-like style. Want to amp up the sex appeal? Go for these bow-adorned mesh briefs. The design from Agent Provocateur was so popular that the brand brought it back, and you’ll love to wear ’em on a night out. The fabric is breathable and the neutral hue is subtle, making the bows the cute focal point. If you’re wearing a figure-hugging dress and want to create a smooth silhouette, get this pair that doubles as shapewear. Genius, right? The shape lies flat under tight fabric for a seamless look, but the lace detailing over the hip still makes it feel like sophisticated underwear. It comes in black as well and has a four-star rating with more than 400 reviews. Ever touch a fabric that feels like butter? Then wait until you put these on. The supersoft modal-and-spandex material is like a second skin, and the raw-cut edges mean you won’t ever deal with those annoying panty lines. One reviewer said she forgot she had them on, which is basically the highest compliment any underwear can receive.

			 All my “kids’ table” people, WYA?   Thanksgiving (aka the holiday when you eat an ungodly amount of turkey and gravy) is about two months away, but that means you have plenty of time to plan the perfect turkey-day ’fit. Whether your get-togethers are fancy soirees or informal affairs and whether they’re with friends or family, we know above all else that you just wanna look cute—but also feel comfortable after consuming a giant three-course meal. Here, 25 Thanksgiving outfit ideas for the festive day.  No idea what to wear? A comfy sweater in autumnal shades paired with a faux-leather skirt is a cute go-to Thanksgiving outfit. If it’s already super chilly out, bundle up in a plush teddy coat and wear a neutral sweater underneath. Pair it with dark-wash jeans and cute suede booties for a full lewk. Leopard print is still having a major moment, but differentiate your sweater with one in a bright red shade. Wear it with a polished faux-leather skirt and black heels for a sophisticated ’fit. Plaid and fall go together like pumpkin spice and lattes. Wear your skirt with a bell-sleeve sweater, black boots, and a crossbody for an effortless ensemble. A number you can wear as a dress AND a cardigan is two looks for the price of one! The soft fabric will feel so comfy, and it looks even better when paired with burgundy boots. Going for more drama? A dress with an asymmetrical hem is definitely eye-catching, and you can complete it with a pair of feathered high heels. A floral print in shades of pink, orange, and olive green is the way to go if you can’t commit to one color. Plus, white boots match the contrasting trim on the sleeves. You might think blazers are super formal, but when they’re paired with colored denim and casual sneakers, the ensemble is the perfect balance of dressy and low-key. You can never go wrong with a silky button-down and slick black jeans. Accessorize with neutral block-heel sandals and you’re ready for some turkey! Wear a buttoned shift on its own or layer with a long-sleeve underneath for a cute fall look. Knee-high boots make it look super elevated t00. You’ll be sitting most of the time anyway, so they won’t kill your feet! If your Thanksgiving get-togethers are usually more of a dressy affair, then get a belted dress with flutter sleeves. Finish the outfit with a chain-handle bag and strappy metallic heels. Shorts are totally worthy of Thanksgiving, especially when they’re plaid wool ones like these. Wear a simple black bodysuit underneath so you don’t have to constantly tuck in your shirt and calf-high black boots to finish it off. If your fam is anything like mine, turkey day is extremely casual. A short-sleeve T-shirt with deep-red corduroys and combat boots is really all you need for a comfy, low-key ensemble. Throw a cardigan over leather shorts and pair it with slouchy boots to really make a statement at the dinner table. Keep it simple but oh-so-stylish in a long-sleeve black mini with a knotted detail on one side and knee-high boots. *Stefon voice* This jumpsuit has everything: puffy sleeves, flared legs, a front zipper, and a gorge hue. Accessorize with a headband and white top-handle. Wear faux-leather shorts for an edgier Thanksgiving vibe, but balance them out with a white sweater featuring cute heart-shaped buttons at the shoulder. The high-waisted cut of these will be so comfy when you’re eating your weight in mashed potatoes. Plus, a light sweater and wine-colored boots add some color. Show a little shoulder in a semi-sexy ribbed turtleneck, and wear straight-leg jeans, flip-flop heels, and statement jewelry to keep it minimal yet chic. A structured corset top with loose sleeves is stunning, but when it’s tucked into jeans with a belt, it’s also v trendy. Everyone needs a simple black top, but this one has a fun twist. (I’m sorry.) Pair it with medium-wash denim and a bright-colored handbag if you want to accessorize. Corduroy is a trend that comes back every fall, but I am so here for it. A skirt in the soft fabric paired with an oversize knit and thigh-high boots will look amazing in all those family photos. Who doesn’t love a little puff-sleeve action? Keep the focus on your shoulders by making the rest of your ’fit (skinny jeans and black heels) simple. This tie-dye pattern adds a little fun to any outfit, and it’s perfect if you don’t want to give up on summer trends just yet. The semi-sheerness goes perfectly with a cute bralette, and it looks great tucked into distressed denim. A pleated midi is timeless and a bronze hue goes with anything—even a snakeskin-printed top and cream-colored sandals.

The brand even offers a 30-day return or exchange policy as well as a lens-replacement service offered up to a year after purchase.

			 A real pro. Sadie Sink, the 15-year-old actress behind Stranger Things' tomboyish Mad Max, just made her surprise runway debut at Undercover's Paris fall 2018 fashion week show today. Sink was a pro on the runway, walking in three looks: a red sweat set, green jacket with cream pants and the most statement of statement scarves, and finally a green jacket that said "Total Youth" during the finale.    OMG YES SADIE 👏🏻 A post shared by  Sadie Sink Fanpage (@sadieslaugh) on Mar 2, 2018 at 8:26am PST  While this is Sink's first runway show, this is not her first foray into fashion. As W notes, Sink landed a Miu Miu holiday campaign that debuted in December:   So honored to be in the #MiuMiuWhispers campaign. A post shared by  Sadie Sink (@sadiesink_) on Dec 16, 2017 at 1:30pm PST She also just unveiled her first Nike campaign at the end of February for their Epic React sneakers:  I love running in my new Nike Epic React shoes. They’re soft AND springy at the same time. Like my feet are marshmallows! Thanks, @nikerunning! #nikereact #teamnike A post shared by  Sadie Sink (@sadiesink_) on Feb 20, 2018 at 9:01am PST  Of course, it should be noted that because Sink is only 15, this breaks PFW rules regarding models’ ages.

			 These “hatbands” make Blair Waldorf’s choices look like child’s play.  In case you weren’t aware, padded headbands have been a hot accessory since Prada debuted a silky, voluminous style at its spring 2019 runway show. Since then, Kate Middleton’s been spotted wearing one, Chrissy Teigen’s “headband of the day” featured one, and now, at New York Fashion Week, you can’t take two steps outside a show without seeing someone with one topping their carefully styled tresses. Padded headbands, or as royal style expert Elizabeth Holmes terms them, “hatbands,” are basically regs headbands that have, you guessed it, padding inside. That gives them a few extra inches of volume and a more luxe feel. (P.S. can we make “hatbands” the official name for these? So much cuter than clunky “padded headbands.”) Here’s the OG Prada one, for reference: All the models wore them, BTW, and so many different colors and styles were on display during the show. Take a cue from the ~everyone~ at NYFW to inspire you. They look good with sleek, straight locks, tousled waves, natural texture, or with your do pulled back in a low bun or pony. Any part will do, but many of these blogger types went for the center. Short hair, long hair—doesn’t matter. It all looks good! Street stylers really love the puff sleeve-plus-hatband combo this year, so that could be a nice twosome for you to dabble in, you know, if you wanna. These guys are also very nice with blazers and maxi dresses, FYI.  The two most Insta-famous hatband brands are Lele Sadoughi and Jennifer Behr, who both have rounded, braided, and knotted versions of the trends with various embellishments, like pearls and crystals. These styles range from about $40 to $400, so they definitely can be an investment. If you’re not looking to spend quite that much yet but want to give the look a test run, plenty of affordable options are out there from the likes of ASOS, Amazon, Free People, and Urban Outfitters. Allow me to show you the prettiest assortment: Cool cool cool, so now you know if you didn’t already. Get out there and live your best royal/celeb/style-star headband life—class dismissed.

			 Hint: There's a LOT of pink. From poufy pink gowns to elegant halter-necks, here are the most memorable bridesmaid dress styles from each of the last 30 years — as seen on TV, the silver screen, and your favorite celebrities. Long before Sex and the City, the beloved late '80s-early '90s sitcom Golden Girls offered up serious squad goals. In Season 4, episode 6, the crew’s oldest, possibly sassiest member, Sophia (Estelle Getty) ties the knot — and Rose (Betty White) wears a pale-pink satin dress with long sleeves, a subtle tonal pattern, and shoulder pads that were surprisingly modest for the era. Sally (Meg Ryan) does bridesmaid duty in When Harry Met Sally, but her dress is a far cry from the pastel monstrosities of many '80s weddings. There are shoulder pads, yes, but the V-necked dress is black, a.k.a. actually quite wearable for other situations. At Rod Stewart and Rachel Hunter’s nuptials in Beverly Hills, there were bagpipes, tons of paparazzi, and seriously flashy bridesmaid attire. Although Hunter steals the show in her simple, long-sleeve lace gown featuring an avalanche of tulle, take a peek at her ‘maid in the background, who’s wearing a sparkly, gold-trimmed look with poufy sleeves and a plunging neckline. In Father of the Bride, George Banks (Steve Martin), has a tough time grappling with his beloved daughter, Annie (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) growing up and getting hitched. She ties the knot with her beau, Bryan (George Newbern). There’s a quartet of bridesmaids swathed in bubblegum pink, and each is trimmed with not one but two massive bows: in their hair and on the backs of their dresses. Here’s another ultra-pink bridesmaid dress situation, this time involving varying rosy shades, for Jackie and Mel’s wedding on Beverly Hills, 90210 in Season 2, episode 28. Check out Brenda (Shannen Doherty) and Kelly (Jennie Garth) in these Malibu Barbie-worthy looks, complete with wide tulle halter-neck detailing tied in a big bow in the back, fitted bodices, and voluminous skirts.  In the Mother of the Bride TV movie (no relation to Father of the Bride), the bridesmaids’ hue is — you guessed it! — pink. This time, it’s a soft pastel shade and worn by two cute kids. The dress features faint striping, slightly puffy short sleeves, and a bow adorning the waist. More pink — but with the fussiest, poufiest detailing imaginable — was the M.O. for one of the weddings in the British rom-com Four Weddings and a Funeral. There’s a huge bow on the back which almost resembles fairy wings, plus marshmallow-esque puffy white sleeves. Charles’ (Hugh Grant’s) quirky sister, Scarlett (the late Charlotte Coleman), has some serious wardrobe malfunctions: She scrambles to secure her hairpiece during the ceremony, and her dress splits down the back, revealing blue skivvies. Last year, a bride, Tammi Sauer, unearthed some photos of these off-the-shoulder looks, posted them on Facebook, and one of her bridesmaids, Heidi Mann, dug up her own gown, put it on, and snapped pictures of herself doing everyday tasks in it to poke fun at the prospect of actually re-wearing a bridesmaid dress (much less this dress) again. The post went viral: Just check out that burgundy brocade fabric and white crochet trim combo, which came from a Jessica McClintock pattern. (Is there anything more '90s than Jessica McClintock?) Pink and poufy: commonly-tread territory when it comes to OTT bridesmaid dresses. For further proof, look no further than Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) in Season 2, episode 24 of Friends, done up for her friend Mindy’s wedding in a Pepto Bismol-hued look with the puffiest of sleeves, a sparkly design on the chest, and a pink ruffle-trimmed hat. Julianne (Julia Roberts) gets roped into being the maid of honor for the fiancée (Cameron Diaz) of her best friend in My Best Friend's Wedding, with whom she’s secretly in love. She ultimately lets him go, walking down the aisle wearing this lavender gown featuring a soft draped neckline. But hey, at least she isn’t suckered into wearing the pink and yellow strapless frocks that the bride’s annoying cousins had to wear. Another great Friends bridesmaid moment: At Ross (David Schwimmer) and Emily’s (Helen Victoria Baxendale) wedding, spread out over two episodes in Season 4, the bridesmaids, who included Monica (Courteney Cox), wear red gowns with spaghetti straps and slightly draped necklines. The slinky, very '90s slipdress silhouette was a welcome departure from the princess-y tulle-overloaded explosions that dominated '80s and '90s bridesmaid styles. When Topanga (Danielle Fishel) and Cory (Ben Savage) finally get married in episode 7 of Season 7 of Boy Meets World, you were probably too busy tearing up and scrambling to find tissues to spot the 'maids and their getups: long maroon tank gowns. It’s basically a wedding-apropos version of the strappy tank tops you probably wore with everything as a tween. In the series finale of the O.G. Beverly Hills, 90210, Donna (Tori Spelling) and David (Brian Austin Green) get hitched, and the bridal party is festooned in strappy, grape-hued satin gowns. On the plus side, there’s no pouf factor whatsoever. For Monica (Courteney Cox) and Chandler’s (Matthew Perry) wedding in Season 7, episode 24 of Friends, Rachel and Phoebe wear possibly the least stereotypical bridesmaid dresses imaginable: a breezy, vacation-y pale green-and-yellow floral print with a flowy silhouette and double-layered skirt. “Those bridesmaid dresses got the most calls and inquiries of anything on the whole show," the show’s costume designer, Debra McGuire, said in a 2017 interview. My Big Fat Greek Wedding, about an endearingly tight-knit, sometimes-overbearing, sprawling Greek brood features the kind of bridal-party getups that bridesmaid-dress nightmares are made of. Think powder blue and halter-necked, with big flowers nestled at the base of a plunging neckline. The dresses are ruched from ribcage to the top of the thigh before exploding into a mess of tulle on the bottom. When Charlotte (Kristin Davis) gets hitched for the second time on Sex and the City, her crew turns it out in all black, each dress featuring distinctive silhouettes and necklines. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) wears a scoop-neck style with a tight bodice, while Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) opts for a sleeveless V-neck LBD, and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) rocks a sheer, long-sleeved number.   There were a couple of weddings over the course of the early-aughts soapy teen show The O.C. For Julie (Melinda Clarke) and Caleb’s (Alan Dale) wedding in Season 1, episode 27, the bridal party, which includes Marissa (Mischa Barton), isn’t too thrilled about the nuptials, but the gang still shows up for the occasion in bright crimson. Claire (Rachel McAdams) gets to wear plenty of bridesmaid looks throughout the course of Wedding Crashers, and many of them are actually quite on-trend for the mid-aughts. This fluid, romantic pastel look features a softly draped neckline and could get extra mileage for, say, a black-tie affair. In Season 3, episode 2 of Desperate Housewives, Bree (Marcia Cross) ties the knot, and Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), and Gaby (Eva Longoria) wear eggplant-hued dresses with skinny straps and square necklines for the occasion. Longoria’s character goes all-out on the accessories, pairing a thick strand of pearls with dangly earrings, and all three clutch all-white bouquets. When Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segel), get hitched in Season 2, episode 21 of HIMYM, Robin (Cobie Smulders) wears a lilac dress. It has a simple, sleeveless silhouette with a square-cut neckline and minimal detailing: just some subtle ruching on the bust and at the waist. It’s nearly impossible to pick a favorite among the many, many bridesmaid looks that Jane (Katherine Heigl) has stuffed, quite literally, into every nook of her closet in 27 Dresses. But here’s one of the more unique numbers: It’s satin and features two shades of purple and a big sash at the waist. But, best of all, check out the halter-flared collar combo situation that somehow turns into a rectangular neckline. In Confessions of a Shopaholic, Rebecca (Isla Fisher) wears a shiny, hot-pink, off-the-shoulder gown with rainbow-hued layers of tulle skirts. Oh, and there’s a tiny, poufy hot pink veil in the mix, too. When Lucia (America Ferrera) ties the knot in Our Family Wedding, her bridesmaids wear knee-length frocks in bright coral. Her squad pulls off the vibrant hue, each 'maid opting for slightly different necklines. Selena Gomez wore a teal halter-neck gown for the vows of her close pal and costume designer Shannon Larossi; the two met while working on The Wizards of Waverly Place. The wedding took place in Los Cabos, Mexico, and although the bridesmaids’ dresses featured varying hemlines and necklines, they all looked comfortable enough to wear while traipsing on the beach. When Blair (Leighton Meester) weds Louis (Hugo Becker) in Season 5, episode 13 of Gossip Girl, her acolytes anxiously vie to be in the wedding party. Those who make the cut for the lavish affair are rewarded with peachy, one-shoulder frocks with exaggeratedly rounded rosette-trimmed skirts and black belts. Serena (Blake Lively) wears a romantic, diaphanous gown in the same delicate hue. Lady Gaga certainly knows how to deliver a jaw-dropping getup, but she also can tone it down when the occasion calls for it — like, say, when’s she’s in her best friend Bo O’Connor’s bridal party. Gaga donned a pale pink gown with a plunging halter neckline and a flowing skirt, plus a large, matching flower in her hair. Beyoncé looked predictably gorgeous in a white textured bodycon tank dress for her sister Solange’s wedding. The curve-hugging piece wasn’t some bespoke, wildly exorbitant creation, either: it was an off-the-rack Torn by Ronny Kobo dress that cost $349. Jennifer Rosales' large squad of 'maids wore a whole spectrum of purple hues. RiRi opted for a pale lavender Badgley Mischka gown with delicate silver floral detailing on the skirt. Meghan Markle was resplendent in a flowy peach gown as the maid of honor at her best friend Lindsay Roth’s wedding; the two met as freshman at Northwestern University. Now, the burning question is: What sort of bridesmaid dress aesthetic will Markle opt for when it comes to her own breathlessly-awaited royal nuptials in May? For her BFF Abigail Anderson’s wedding, Taylor Swift donned a wine-hued halter-neck dress with pretty tucked detailing on the bust and an elegant full skirt. It’s a pretty familiar-feeling bridesmaid style: You may have worn it at some point yourself or have seen pics in your Facebook feed of other pals in color-coordinated versions of this dress.

			 This relationship drama is getting curiouser and curiouser.  ICYMI, Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber confirmed their engagement on Monday after rumors swirled that Justin proposed to the model while vacationing in the Bahamas. He took to Instagram to share the news, while Hailey tweeted confirmation, but it still left everyone asking: "What in the world is Selena Gomez up to?"    Well, according to this photo, it seems Justin's ex-flame indulged in some retail therapy in New York City on Tuesday. And if you take a closer look at her seemingly casual outfit, you'll see her black T-shirt from Storets featured the words, "Only the strong survive" on the ruffled front pocket.  Was the shirt a possible dig at their relationship, because she doesn't think it's "strong enough to survive"? Or was it more of a personal mantra so she can get through this bombshell engagement news? Or am I simply reading way too much into her cute statement tee?  Interpret this information as you will, but in the meantime, you can shop her T-shirt online, which is still available in black, green, and white.   Thinking of you all during this tumultuous time of celebrity relationships dramz. We'll get through this, it's OK!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Spending all your money just got so much more convenient, lol.  As if Instagram wasn't targeting your wallet enough with its sponsored ads and fancy product tags (FYI more than 130 million people tap to reveal those in posts, according to the brand), you can now purchase items from select brands without ever leaving the platform.  How does it work? The feature, which launched Tuesday morning, will take you to the product-details page like it normally would when you click on a tag, except you'll see a new option to "Checkout on Instagram."  If you proceed, you'll put in all your shipping, billing, and card info directly within the app. You'll even be able to track and receive notifications about shipments and deliveries. According to the press release, all your info is saved securely so you don't have to re-enter in anything for any of your other purchases.  TL;DR? Buying items on Insta has never been faster or more convenient (or dangerous for my personal bank account, omg). BTW, they've partnered with 20 initial brands, which you can see below but could expand to more in the future.  Shop wisely, fam.

			 I’m already feeling cozier.  As far as I’m concerned, very few things can compare to wearing cashmere. Smooth to the touch and oh-so luxurious, cashmere is one of those fabrics you want to wear everywhere—and I mean everywhere: after a workout, during a lazy Sunday at home, or running errands. As the unofficial Everything Store, Amazon is known for selling anything from Instagram-famous dresses to trendy hair accessories. But did you know that Amazon also sells dreamy cashmere joggers for less than $100? Casual. Brought to you by a company called Cashmeren, this pair of pants is made entirely of a durable, two-ply cashmere that won’t pull after a few wears. Plus, the company claims this cashmere is sustainably sourced, so you can look and feel your best while lounging. While, yes, joggers are often associated with chilling on the couch, Cashmeren’s surprisingly elevated design will make you want to wear these around the clock. The subtle drawstring offers a comfortable fit, while the semi-slouched silhouette make this one pair of joggers you’ll actually want to show off.  Plus, this pair is available in a range of versatile colors, so you can grab the best one for your personal style.  Normally, anything made with cashmere will cost you a small fortune. While Cashmeren’s prices vary by size and color, you can get a pair of joggers for as little as $89.90.  Psst...the brand also offers a matching sweater.  After all, you can never have too much cashmere.

			 The designer's iconic "Sam" bag influenced a generation who will always love its timeless elegance. New York designer Kate Spade died June 5 of an apparent suicide. Celebrities and fashion industry insiders immediately mourned the loss, but now, a generation of women who grew up with the classic, boxy "Sam" bag are reminiscing about their first Kate Spade handbags, and it's truly touching.  "Kate Spade ... represented the glamorous New Yorker I was hoping to be," says Alex, a 30-year-old from North Carolina. "I specifically asked for a Kate Spade bag when I was 15, and while I received the knockoff — which I nostalgically refuse to throw out — I loved it. When I was old enough to buy my own nice purses and wallets, her brand was the first stop."    Even if you didn't own one of her designer purses, they still made an impact. "I didn't have a Kate Spade bag growing up but I always thought they were so chic and classic," says Annalisa, 29. "Other designer handbags represent a time in your life — like high school or college — that you'd outgrow, but Kate Spade made the type of bag that would go with you through all the different stages. Timeless." Many women grew up coveting the style, and for most of them, it was the first investment bag they owned. Age 13 with a little Kate Spade purse and a Wet Seal dress, you couldn't touch me. What sad sad news. Kate Spade was a legendary designer and as a young woman I always despised the idea of owning a purse until she alone showed me how it could be powerful. She embodied the modern woman. RIP Kate Spade 🎀@katespadeny Kate Spade was one of those rare designers who held up from preadolescence to adulthood, probably by making me feel smart & confident in a way no other brands did. What a loss. I remember in senior year of high school I saved up for months to buy myself a kate spade wallet. I remember feeling so mature and sophisticated, like I was finally ready to take on the world. The first gift my husband ever gave me was a Kate Spade bag that I had been coveting. I’ve always been drawn to the whimsy and fun culture of the brand. Another reminder that the light does not exist without an equal amount of dark. 💔 My first “designer” bag was Kate Spade... flash forward 18 years and it’s the brand I️ chose for my bridal party. My heart is saddened by the news of Kate Spade’s passing. Such a strong women who paved the way for so many. #RIPKateSpade ♠️ I remember my mom bought me my first Kate Spade bag. A few years later I handed it down to my twin sister & now she wears it everyday to work #rememberingkatespade 💔 But it isn't just about how timeless and simple the accessories are. It's also that there is a vibrance and playfulness to them.   just looking at kate spade items made me feel happier when i was at my worst. they felt like they were filled with joy, and always managed to bring colour into my world. i'm so so so sad, and i'm sending all my thoughts, love and condolences to her friends and family. Heartbroken to hear about Kate Spade. I hope she can be remembered for her legacy of creating a world of whimsy and making simple things feel special and beautiful. If you or a loved one are struggling with mental health, please know you don't have to do it alone | 1-800-273-8255 RIP Kate Spade - literally one of my favourite designers who always bought colour, quirkiness, and a quality of sophistication into her designs. She will truly be missed. Please contact your local suicide helpline. #KateSpade @katespadeny I really am so sad about Kate Spade. Her designs have been symbols of confidence and independence for so many women. I bought the 25th Anniversary Sam purse last month as a 25th birthday present for myself. Rest In Peace, Kate ♠️ pic.twitter.com/mzYPeD3l6H If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 It's also a favorite of Meghan Markle's!  Just because Kim Kardashian has her own makeup line, KKW Beauty,  doesn't mean she doesn't rely on other cosmetics brands to achieve a flawless finish. According to Byrdie, makeup artist Patrick Ta divulged that her go-to product for coverage is none other than Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation. Yep, that's the same one that Meghan Markle reportedly loves. In a recent tutorial on Kim's app, Ta did her makeup and showed viewers how she achieves the most perfect foundation application. Other products he used are REN 3-in-1 Cleansing Water, Make Up For Ever Lift Concealer, and Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder.  To prep the skin so your foundation applies smoothly.  To hydrate the skin before application.  To brighten and highlight the under-eye area, nose, forehead, Cupid's bow, and chin.  To set all the product for long-lasting wear.  But Kim and Meghan aren't the only celebrities obsessed with Giorgio Armani's liquid foundation—other fans of product include Cate Blanchett, Rashida Jones, and even Kim's little sis' Kylie Jenner.  Happy 21st birthday @kyliejenner baby!!!!! It’s such a trip that my baby sister is 21 😱 So happy to be on this sister and now mom journey with you forever!!!! I love you so much! You will still always be my baby sis and I’m always here for you no matter what! A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 10, 2018 at 7:32am PDT

			 Stitch Fix to the rescue! This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Having a personal shopper seems like a luxury reserved only for celebrities, right? Not exactly. Stitch Fix is an online styling service that sends you curated selections of clothing and accessories based on your fashion likes and dislikes—and the coolest part is that there are real stylists selecting the items in your mailing. So, that whole thing about personal shoppers being just for A-list celebs? Not so much. To get started, you take a style quiz to flesh out a profile that will give your stylist a sense of your budget, lifestyle, body type, etc. When you're ready to get your first order, a Fix comes to your door with a selection of five pieces. If you keep everything, you get a 25 percent discount. If you don't like items in your haul, pop them in the pre-paid envelope that comes with your order (returns are totally free)  and toss it in a USPS mailbox. You get to send feedback with your returns, which means that your stylist learns more about you every time you get a Fix. Stitch Fix isn't a subscription service, so while you can schedule automatic shipments to get boxes regularly, you don't have to—just order a Fix any time you need a closet update. They carry thousands of brands (from Kate Spade and Rag & Bone to Madewell and Paige), so there's always tons of variety. Want to see it in action? Cosmopolitan Fashion Editor Rachel Torgerson decided to give the service a go, mixing in pieces from her Fix with items already in her closet. Check out the video above to see how she styled each look, and to try it out yourself, take the Stitch Fix style quiz.

			 Right this way for your new summer wardrobe.  On Tuesday, J. Crew announced a new 22-piece collection in collaboration with size-inclusive, fashionable label Universal Standard, and you'll want to get your hands on it, stat. The launch includes basic tees, trendy track pants, cardigans, maxi dresses, jersey skirts, and more, in various color ways like black, red, lilac, teal, and green.  And the kicker? The clothes go up to size 5x and "ensure that each design is tailored for the real, diverse spectrum of the American woman," according to an email sent by a press representative. On the website, you can even view them on different body types, so you can get a better idea of how they would look on you. "The whole collection works really well together," says Alexandra Waldman, co-founder of Universal Standard. "It has that wonderful Americana [vibe] that J. Crew is famous for with its stripes and ginghams. It also has modern, clean pieces which is our hallmark. I think that this collaboration is going to make a lot of women, hopefully, very happy."  This isn't the first time J. Crew has ventured into more diverse sizes. In January, the brand, along with its sister company Madewell, announced it was extending its denim sizes to 35, up from a 32, causing various styles to quickly sell out and be put on backorder.   Now, with this new Universal Standard collab, it's continuing to strive toward "breaking down barriers that keep tens of millions of women from participating in style," as stated in a press email.

			 Headed back to college soon? Then you NEED to see this.  Let's face it: Dorm rooms can be dimly lit, dingy, and dungeon-like; they can also be tragically small and cramped. There's not really a lot going for them. Sorry! But, there is hope because these 16 dorms underwent complete transformations that are truly HGTV-level amazing. They are beautiful, unique, and OTT in the best possible way. Click through to see some incredible "before and afters" that will inspire you to hit up your nearest Home Goods, stat.  In addition to a tragic lighting scenario, this two-bed dorm looked like it had no personality. Each bed was separated by a wall, which which was private, but made the space feel smaller.  The twin sisters who occupied this dorm turned it into two unique, but cohesive rooms—one with a pink lamp and lighter bedding and the other with darker pattered bedsheets. They added a huge plant to cover the empty wall but still make it homey.  This dorm room featured carpeting and had two beds facing different directions on opposite sides of the room. The space was big to begin with, but because of all the shelves and the piano in the corner, the space wasn't completely utilized.  The Sorry Girls, a.k.a. Kelsey and Becky, who are DIY fanatics on YouTube, overhauled this dorm with a minimalist vibe. They used the desk as a center point and made sure both beds faced the same direction. They also added twinkling lights to open the room up, while wire frames with photos really personalized it.  This was another room flip courtesy of The Sorry Girls, which featured an unusually roomy dorm that needed more cozy details to make it feel welcoming. The tile floor and beds were plain and lacking personality.  For this switch-up, they dressed up the non-working fireplace with a chic round mirror, plants, and candles, since it was a focal-point of the room. Shag rugs covered the cold tile flooring, and cute storage containers made the desks more organized.  On move-in day, Moriah Snipes and Sydney Parker's room was a blank canvas that showed major potential with its natural lighting and cool brick wall.  They collaborated on a color scheme of mint green, white, and grey with their bedding and home accessories, and also added additional storage above their beds. Lighting on each side made the concrete block walls more cozy and the two roomies put a huge butterfly chair and shaggy pouf in between for extra seating.  A dark grey wall and hard carpeting really made this dorm feel smaller and bland, but the lofted-style beds showed potential for efficient storage.  The blue and pink colors, along with the monogrammed touch above each bed, really dressed the room up, and a tiny sofa in between each made it look more like a home. Extra pillows, wall art, and photo frames really personalized the space.  Most of the time you don't have a lot of square footage to work with—take this room for example, with its beds squeezed right next to each other.   This dorm underwent a huge makeover with the help of a grey color scheme, which included a soft rug, fluffy bedspreads, curtains, and a faux-brick wall decal. The long bed skirts made a huge difference because they hid messy storage. The wall art also really gave the room a cool vibe.  Just because the furniture is in one place in your dorm doesn't mean it has to be left there. This one had the bed and desk right next to each other, which made the room feel super cramped. The desk disappeared to another side of the room in this photo to make space for a nightstand. A lightbox, tassels, and the tapestry covered up the white wall, while millennial pink bedding, pillows, and a shag rug, kept the aesthetic trendy.  This dorm felt like a classroom with its multicolored tile and stark white walls. Plus, a lot of areas were missing a personal touch for that lived-in feel.  To change things up, a chic lavender and white nightstand in the center was big enough for both roomies to share. Fabric headboards installed on each bed made it cozier, and a white furry rug covered up most of the tiling. Also, a new bench at the foot of one bed added storage and served as a stool for the lofted bed.  Another dull dorm, but this time with a mini fridge and microwave at least! While the floating shelf was a nice touch, the rest of this room at the University of Alabama seemed plain.  The mini fridge and microwave moved to another part of this room to make way for a tall nightstand with textured containers. A new white bureau in between each bed provided more shelf room that fit ceramic decor and knickknacks. A metallic storage cube matched the bedding, and also served as a spot for more clothes and for getting on top of the tall bed.  A dreary-looking dorm is common, but you can do a lot with the space and circumstances you're given, like this tiny room at Louisiana State University.  Take this amazing makeover, for example. It's hard to believe it's the same room as the "before" picture, but that's what great lighting and amazing decorating does to a place. A new wide bureau doubled as a nightstand for each roomie, and the mirrored doors on it opened the space up. Plus, the matching white and magenta color scheme really tied everything together.  Now, this is the same picture as before, but illustrates how different a finished dorm can turn out with the same space. Many rooms have the same layouts, which makes it more challenging to personalize, but all the more satisfying once you've transformed it.  These roommates also added a shared double nightstand in between their beds, but this one had mesh wire baskets on each side. The grey lampshades made the lighting more modern, and the simple addition of studded headboards really elevated this dorm's style.  A room with dark paint, an even darker floor, and wood furniture, such as this one at Southern Methodist University, can make a larger area seem so much smaller.  These roommates brightened their room with their choice of light bedding and a white and grey striped area rug. Cushioned desk chairs replaced uncomfortable wooden ones, and white storage cubes added extra seating, and provided a lift onto their tall beds. These beds both faced the side of this room at Michigan State University with an empty wall in between and a window to the right.  These roomies hung an aqua and white tapestry to cover the plain wall, bought a long table to make a nightstand for each, and added a cozy sofa in the middle to lounge on. Star decals and personal photos spruced up the plain walls, and a cute coffee table gave the the room extra style.  This room featured two beds on one side, and a whole shelving system, with closets, and desks on the other (not pictured). But while it had a different setup than many other dorms, it still lacked personality and an efficient layout.  With its super chic makeover, the white and grey bedding made it so much brighter, and the space underneath the floating shelf was filled with a tiny chest that provided more room to put decor, as well as added a space for more clothes. The students could also change the lighting vibe with the extra lamps on the nightstand and shelf.  Ah, the joys of move-in day, complete with the chaos of suitcases, boxes, and family members all squeezing into your tiny room to get you settled in. Take this dorm pic at Texas Christian University, for example.  The transformation of this dorm was so, so cute with its teal, grey, and white color palette, patterned rug, and sentimental photo frames hung above each bed. And, yep, those super functional storage cubes made an appearance again!

			 Her mismatched earrings are so on point.  Meghan Markle just added a Welsh gold wedding band to her jewelry box after marrying Prince Harry two weeks ago, but the new Duchess of Sussex already owns quite an array of rings and bangles. While she only just gained access to the Queen's vault of jewels — her wedding tiara counted as "something borrowed" — Meghan may refrain from borrowing some of the glitzier pieces.  Her penchant for minimal, delicate pieces in warm golds puts her at odds with what her new in-laws frequently sport. In fact, you have to really zero in on photos to catch a clear glimpse of what she wore. On the other hand, the Duchess of Cambridge favors jewelry that's a little bigger than whisper-thin.   "People compare her a lot to Kate [Middleton] obviously, and Kate tends to wear slightly larger, more colorful pieces," says royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of The Court Jeweller. "She really likes matching sets of jewelry, but Meghan is much trendier ... a little less in that traditional English, royal mode. " Here's how Meghan's minimalist pieces stack up: The Duchess of Cambridge of course received Princess Diana's sapphire cluster back in 2011, but Prince Harry designed a ring for his bride with an equal amount of sentimental value. He sourced the center stone from Botswana — where they visited early in their relationship — and the two additional diamonds came from his mother's collection. Altogether the ring is about 6.5 carats, Money estimates. The center gem on Kate's is about 12 carats alone — not to mention the 14 other diamonds. Given their royal associations, however, experts value both pieces as "priceless." Prince Harry told BBC that he selected yellow gold for Meghan's engagement ring because it's "her favorite," and based on what his bride has worn in public recently, he's right on the money. She wore this collection of glimmering bangles at a concert for the Queen's 92nd birthday in April.  The double-diamond white gold earrings came from Birks, which is the "a Canadian store equivalent of Tiffany’s," Kay says. It's the same brand that supplied the opal earrings she wore at her engagement announcement.  The trendy jacket style has the second gem suspended from the earring back instead of the front. Altogether they contain 1.39 carats of diamonds and cost approximately $7,000. Not a bad way to meet the entire extended royal family! Everyone was too busy looking at Meghan's messy bun during her January visit to Cardiff Castle to notice her asymmetrical studs.  On her right side she wore Zofia Day's Dash Ear Studs, while in her left ear she had Gabriela Artigas's Yellow Triple Shooting Star Earring. You can actually buy both as a single earring instead of a pair!   "It shows that she has a very down-to-earth attitude while still presenting herself with sophistication," Zofia Day founder Lisette Polnyn told People of Meghan's playful look.   Meghan Markle shook hands with people at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April wearing thin bands on nearly every finger, including her thumb. The move was "unusual for a British royal to do," Kay says, but she'd done it before on a trip to Scotland. (Pssst: That gorgeous open bracelet from Tai is only $65.)    While not everyone can afford multi-carat diamonds, this is one Meghan-inspired jewelry look more people can get in on. On a visit to Scotland she wore a $60 Missoma Interstellar Ring and a majorly affordable $44 Catbird Threadbare Ring. Kate Middleton wore new Robinson Pelham pendants given to her by her parents on her wedding day, but Meghan reached for a pair of Cartier studs she'd previously debuted at an Invictus Games event just the month before. According to the jeweler, the design of the collection "is a modern allegory of seduction featuring harmonious, interlacing curves that play with light and shadow." Ooh la la!   With all eyes on Queen Mary's bandeau tiara, it was easy to miss the dazzling tennis bracelet Meghan wore on her right wrist. The Cartier bangle apparently featured 104 brilliant-cut diamonds  and another 52 baguette-cut diamonds totaling 5.6 carats. You can still buy one —  but you'll have to cough up $155,000. Later that night, she wore a pair of earrings from the same Reflection de Cartier collection worth $68,000 (plus tax, mind you).  Meghan honored generations of royal brides before her by wearing a wedding ring made of extremely rare Welsh gold. The Queen Mother started the trend back in 1923, and Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, Princess Anne, Diana, Princess of Wales, and the Duchess of Cambridge all received bands of the same metal.  For her first appearance as a Duchess at Prince Charles' birthday celebration, Meghan wore Vanessa Tugendhaft's Idylle La Rose Earrings. The 18-karat pavé diamond studs sold out 10 minutes later, according to the designer, with the matching bracelet and necklace disappearing not long afterward. She'd previously worn the brand's Infini ring and Precious Charm necklace, but it's official: Her new royal status comes with some serious style power.

Streetwear company Alife is collaborating with Crocs to bring you... the luxury Croc. Yep. Here they are in their full glory.

Alife Sport Crocs, alife.com, $140 SHOP SOON "The clog is a fashion misfit, which is why I think our collaboration points out that doing something you love is more important than following the latest trends," Alife founder and creative director Rob Cristofaro said in a press release. Okay, sure.  Don't worry, if the sporty sock Crocs aren't your style, there will be other options. There's also a NYC skyline Croc. They're calling this the "art" Croc.

Does this mean that if you want the Brooklyn Bridge on your Crocs, they become display-only? That's crazy, right? Crazy! If you don't think this is the most absurd thing you've ever seen, these Crocs are slated for an early June release. Happy shopping!  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 I never thought earrings could be so life-changing, TBH.  When I turned 18, my mom bought me diamond earrings — like, real diamonds, not cubic zirconia — as a birthday present. I always had eyed my mom's, so I  was beyond excited to have a pair of my own. I amassed quite the jewelry collection during high school, but nothing was prized as much as those studs, and I wore them. Every. Single. Day.  I kept them in my earlobes 24/7. I wore them to bed, in the shower, in the pool, to the beach, and everywhere in between. The classic style and small, simple diamonds paired easily with any outfit, and they quickly became my go-to accessory. I never thought I'd find another like them — that is, until I came across a Net-A-Porter sale last November. I wasn't looking for anything in particular but ended up scanning the on-sale jewelry when these gold threader earrings by Chan Luu caught my eye. SHOP NOW Gold Bar Chain Thread Earrings, CHAN LUU, $58 I had seen this "threader" earring style, in which you literally thread the metal through your ear so that it falls down the back of your lobe, become more popular and was eager to try it out for myself. But I was unprepared for how much I absolutely LOVED them once I put them on.  The delicate gold metal is so minimal and delicate, yet the long chain in the back makes them stand out more than my trusty diamond studs. It's been almost seven months since I made this life-changing jewelry purchase, and I've worn the earrings almost every day.  The long, thin style and gold hue pair with any outfit, and the accessory is an easy way to dress up even the most casual ensemble. I've received countless compliments on them, mostly from complete strangers, and I love to tell them about my newfound love of threader earrings. (Don't worry, mom — I still wear those diamond studs you bought me.)  Plus, these earrings are so light, they feel like you're barely wearing anything on your ears at all. So basically, if you're looking to add a jewelry staple to your collection, this style will transform your earring game, and you'll never want to wear anything else.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			  She had VERY strong feelings about that neckline.  We all know that Meghan Markle married Prince Harry at St George's Chapel on May 19 wearing a Givenchy wedding gown. Now the iconic dress and veil, which, according to BBC, took 50 people and 3,900 hours to make (!!!!!!!!!!!), are at Windsor Castle's newest exhibition, "A Royal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex," and in an audio recording for the display, Meg revealed exactly how she chose the style.    Apparently she "knew at the onset" that she wanted a bateau neckline and slightly cropped sleeves, and her goal was to have it look "modest," with a "very timeless, classic feeling."  She added: "I knew that the tailoring was so key, because the dress itself would be so covered up."  
  On working with British designer Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director of Givenchy, to achieve her perfect wedding day look, she said:  And boy, did both the bride and the designer deliver because, just, WOW:    In the same audio recording for the exhibition, Meghan also described the "incredibly surreal" day she went to pick out her tiara with the Queen and Prince Harry, who cheekily added that he probably wasn't supposed to be there. But who can blame him?!

This pair has an almost perfect 5-star rating on Amazon!  Sweets in your stocking are always a good idea, and Godiva truffles are a simple gift for any chocolate-lovers.  “That’s SO fetch!”—you when you open your stocking to find these amazing fridge magnets.  This “ivory primrose” scent will be a hit if you’re a fan of both fruity and floral notes, including pomegranate, orange, vanilla, and conifer. Sooo heavenly.  These bendy silicone straws are easy to take on the go because they collapse down and even come with a cleaner and matching case. Reducing plastic waste never looked so cute. (Just make sure to use ’em with a reusable glass, too.)  All mascaras kind of seem the same, but when you swipe this formula on your lashes, you’ll be stunned that they can look THAT long; plus, the silver and gold tube is so gorgeous.  Wear these soft guys around the house and you won’t want to take them off. The extra-thick sole also makes it great for outdoor use, too.  Accessorize your plain white cord with a lil animal that looks like it’s biting into your phone. There are tons of critters to choose from if a bunny’s not for you, FYI.  A leak-proof bottle that keeps any liquid cold or hot for long periods of time is one you’ll take with you everywhere—especially when it has a convenient handle at the top.  Layer on up with a cozy plaid scarf that’ll liven up all your solid-colored sweaters.  A thin rose-gold sparkly ring is delicate on your finger, but you can also stack it with other rings for more of a statement look.  A neutral hue will go with any winter wardrobe and keep you warm in blizzard-like temps.  Awww, so tiny! Your day will be made with a super-adorable mini cactus kit that you put together yourself.  It’s about time you joined the rest of the wireless world already! AirPods are definitely the perfect size for a stocking stuffer.  And what’s a pair of AirPods without a unique case?

Let all your thoughts flowww. A pair of fluffy mittens is basically a necessity in the winter, especially if they’re lined. Plus, they’ll look so nice with your cozy cold-weather coats!  Get serious shut-eye with a pink sleep mask that blocks out light and is soft on your skin.  Silky scrunchies are gentle on hair, and get strands out of your face, while adding a playful touch to any ponytail.  Even if you haven’t gone through a heart-wrenching split recently, this tiny cassette-shaped “break up songs” keychain is undeniably cute.  A tiny geometric necklace will be one of your favorite pieces to layer with; plus, it really goes with any outfit. One spritz of this pink fragrance, and you’ll walk around smelling like a heavenly rose garden.  Drinking coffee has never looked so elegant as when you sip it out of a modern marble mug with gold accents.  Sure, the tube is pretty, but this lip balm also enhances the natural color of your lips like magic.  Your home will smell ah-mazing with a luxurious candle that emits the scents of roses and blackcurrant leaves.  There’s nothing like the gift of fresh, bright, and hydrated skin, thanks to this set of minis that includes regenerating face oil, rosewater moisture creme, rose hibiscus face mist, and an instant glow mask.   Is it even the holiday season if you don’t have a shiny manicure? If you get this bottle in your stocking, you’ll still have time to use it for all your New Year’s festivities.

			 Don’t wanna tell you what to do, but… don’t do any of these things, k? Weddings these days have fewer and fewer rules because couples are just more progressive than they used to be. That’s great! Still, while you have a lot more freedom than you may have had 10 years or so ago, there are a few things to remember while getting dressed to be respectful of the ceremony and the people getting married. Let’s get into it, shall we? Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! …or off-white, or really, really pale blue. This should be a no-brainer, but it still bears saying. White dresses are cute! I feel you! But just try not to in this instance. This is the one thing the bride cares about—she’s most likely wearing white, and her white thing def cost more than yours. That wins in this case because she/her family is throwing a party and you are her/their guest. Want to wear something close to white? Try a neutral! Even if the wedding is a more casual event, I promise you: It is not that casual. Like your mom always says, “It’s better to be overdressed than underdressed.” If you are concerned about your comfort level for the day, try an outfit in a soft, natural fabric like cotton. Jeans are too casual as well. Plus, why wear denim when you can wear it literally any other day? Try a blue jumpsuit in a different material, like this cotton fabric, instead: This applies mainly to the men out there, but stick with pants. Yes, even if it’s a hot day in the summer. Women deal with uncomfortable fashion conditions all the time—you can handle it for one day. P.S. Lightweight pants, like these linen ones, can help combat the heat problem: Is the ceremony taking place in a church or in an institution with a more modest dress code? Be respectful of that, and bring a shawl or sweater to cover yourself. This shawl is a cute one!    If you choose to wear pants, still try to be somewhat dressy.  Coordinating suits are a great way to go: Okay, Okay, I know I said it’s better to overdress than to underdress, and I stand by that in general. But read the room: Don’t wear a tux or a ballgown to a backyard wedding—in that case, it’s better to keep it a little more low-key. Here’s a less-dressy option you might like:   Don't wear Yeezy to a wedding. If you like the idea of showing a little unexpected skin, consider a stylish cutout instead.  Need a non-ripped thing? Check out this wedding-appropriate look:

			 Bc I’m tired of sweating, HBU?   Fall will be here sooner than you think, so why not get a head start on your office wardrobe? And no, your work ’fits don’t have to only consist of black pants and constricting blazers. Here, 18 fall work outfit ideas to give you some chic inspo. Whether your office is more dressy or casual, there’s a cute look for you—and it just might make you crave a PSL. Sorry!  Dip your toes into some neutrals when the cold weather hits with a cute cream sweater and brown faux-leather culottes. If it’s the beginning of fall and not quite as freezing, opt for some white sneaks and you’re done! No need to throw on outerwear—unless your office really cranks up the A/C. Yes, you can totally wear florals during fall—especially if they have gorgeous hues of olive green and burnt orange like the ones in this botanical shirtdress. Complete your look with statement earrings and a top-handle for a killer office look. A boilersuit is always chic and easy to throw on if you’re running late to work. One in a bright shade of red will make you stand out in the hallways, and it looks even better with a pair of white-hot boots. Wow, have you ever seen a more elevated outfit?! A camel-tone skirt with a black turtleneck and booties is ultra sophisticated without looking too uptight. A longer patent-leather skirt is work appropriate yet trendy—even more so when worn with a swirly zebra-print shirt and platform slingbacks. Since your bottoms will catch any reflection, they’ll really be the focal point.  Channel the autumnal hues with this orange printed maxi and red block heels. This piece is perfect for transitional weather, too, since the silhouette is summery, but with the right accessories, you can easily wear it in cooler temps. If your office is more casual, simply throw on a classic leather jacket with medium-wash skinnies and brown booties. You can also edge up any of your summer dresses with this outerwear piece to get more wear out of them. A jumpsuit with a literal cheetah print is a piece you’ll love to wear both in and out of the office. The bright pattern stands out against the darker green, and it looks even cuter with a pair of coordinating heeled sandals. A striped button-down is a classic work go-to that doesn’t look at all stuffy with cropped denim jeans and black mules. If it’s *technically* fall but doesn’t quite feel like it temperature-wise, a shorter romper with a belted waist and thick-soled sandals makes a fun ’fit. Once the weather cools down, you can pair it with a statement coat and combat boots. A patterned skirt that also has a solid black panel will go with tons of neutral tops—including this playful keyhole sweater. Balance out the darker tones with a bright heel and you’ll get so many compliments. A knit cardigan is versatile because you can wear it on its own as a top when buttoned all the way or wear it open. Take your tie-dye T-shirt from summer and wear it underneath, and pair it with a black mini, loafers, and ankle socks for an effortless vibe. This look is great for those lazy Mondays when you want to put in minimal effort to get ready. (Basically me every day, TBH.) An oversize beige sweater instantly becomes more put-together with zebra-print pants and black heeled booties. As a bonus, you can wear the comfy sweater as loungewear too! If you *really* love cardigans, get one in dress form with contrasting red and white stripes. Pull it together with matching red ankle-strap shoes and you’ll have the confidence to kill that presentation you’ve been preparing for. Your favorite white T-shirt and jeans might not sound too dressy, but tuck in the shirt and add a double-breasted blazer for an instantly chic work outfit. Complete it with comfortable loafers if you’re on your feet for most of the day. An olive jacket with an open front adds some color to a black sweater dress and beige boots, but you can also wear it with jeans and a T-shirt for a more low-key weekend look. No one will miss you when you walk into the office with a coat as red as this. Balance out the elevated outerwear with distressed crop jeans, a plain T-shirt, and simple heels, and you’ll feel prepared to take on the day—no matter how hectic. Another transitional piece is this onesie with a belted waist. Wear it with sandals in warm temps, but once fall hits, you can wear it with a coat, heels, and a trendy top-handle bag.

			 Say it ain’t so! It’s a sad, sad day for everyone who likes trendy fast fashion that’s super cheap: Forever 21 just filed for bankruptcy.  There have been rumors of this happening for weeks now, and a report back in August even said the fast-fashion retailer was considering it, but now it’s extremely official. A press release says Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday. In even bleaker news, the New York Times reports that Forever 21 will now close a whopping 178 stores in the U.S. and almost 350 stores overall.  Here’s what a company exec has to say about this:  As of right now, it seems like the website is relatively unaffected by this news, which is good news for anyone who spends their lunch breaks scrolling through the “new arrivals” section.  Forever 21 is hardly the first fast-fashion company to struggle lately. Charlotte Russe closed all its stores this year, dELiA*s did the same in 2014, and Claire’s filed for bankruptcy and closed almost 100 stores last year.  Obviously, that’s not awesome for the companies! But as CBS points out, some young customers are losing interest in fast fashion in favor of sustainable, eco-friendly, green clothing brands...which is actually pretty great!

			 Because country music and big style statements go way, way back. The Academy of Country Music Awards, which will take place April 7, will be a night to remember for more than just the music. That's because country stars (and the non-country A-listers who want to dress on-theme) aren't afraid to take fashion risks and use sequins liberally in their ensembles. Take a look back at some of the most ~memorable~ ACM Awards styles ever to get the gist. Lindsey wore a bright yellow dress with a mock-neck top and voluminous tulle bottom.  She wore a blue floral mermaid dress with lace trim and accessorized with a saloon-themed ribbon choker. Dolly donned a sequin jacket with a gold, sparkly lapel over a matching corset and white slacks with a colorful, beaded belt.  Perry arrived in an electric blue fringe skirt with a matching jacket, which she paired with a pink knit crop top and matching pink cowboy boots. Steven showed up in pop art–themed pants with a fitted striped blazer and an oversized newsboy hat.  Tobi's dress was one part leopard print, one part bright red, and one part brown tulle.  While presenting, Kutcher wore a red blazer with white stitching, a black cowboy hat, and a large-buckle belt.  Burrows wore a tight hot pink dress with chunky jewelry, while Dean was dressed in an abstract patterned suit and sneakers.  The magician slipped into a black vest with ripped sleeves, white pants with skulls and crosses, a fedora and lots of chain jewelry. His date wore a red bodycon dress.  Laura rocked a bright blue suit with lace and golden embroidery.  It's Ira again! This time in two-toned blue pants with tiger details at the knees, a black jacket, white-rimmed sunglasses, and a fedora.  Jo Dee wore a cropped golden vest and a ruffled multi-pattern skirt paired with a thick woven belt, a buncha beaded necklaces, and black cowboy boots. Laura wore a black-and-white strapless gown with a coordinating shawl. Tiffany went for a short giraffe-patterned dress with fringe-trimmed sleeves paired with gold sandals. Larry King wore a leather jacket and black slacks, while his wife went with a golden corset dress paired with a feathered bag.  The "Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy" singer performed in a black T-shirt, leather pants, an oversized blazer, and an Uncle Sam–themed top hat.   Penn and Teller wore matching cowboy hats with at least one bunny inside. Deana Carter went with a strapless neon number.  Shania wore a black dress with a sheer top and a ruffled black skirt.  Ira Dean (left) wore an oversized striped suit, colorful T-shirt, thin-framed glasses, and a straw hat. Heidi Newfield wore an off-white slit dress with beaded fringe on the side. And lastly, Keith Burns paired a black cowboy hat with brown ombré jeans and a matching button-up. Keith showed off his yellow silk shirt with golden flowers on the red carpet. He paired the flashy button-down with an oversized jean jacket and jeans.  Laura wore a long dress that straight-up had a picture of a tiger on the front and paired it with a matching cape. Lolita wore a baby-blue suit with matching colored sunglasses.  Sara wore a metallic purple halter top with embroidered pink pants and paired the whole thing with a choker and strappy heels.  Louise wore a bright purple ballgown and paired it with an embroidered handbag that matched the gown's skirt.  Tane wore a sheer backless dress.  Terry wore a black corset beneath a long red overcoat with gold embroidery.  Coley wore this sparkly bikini top with black pants and a matching jacket and paired it with strappy heels. Coley's back at it, this time in a purple disco-ball crop top and matching maxi skirt. Werk, Naomi! She posed in a blue sequin suit with statement-making sleeves. Martie Maguire (left) wore an all-pink tie-dye dress with a feather boa. Natalie Maines (center) opted out of shoes, but wore a short blue dress with a matching sequin robe. Emily Robison (right) wore an orange dress with a jeweled top and a matching shawl.

			 Oh, is that weird to you? Hi everyone, and welcome to Gen Z! I’m your host, Sam, and I’m gonna show you why—despite what it looks like on social—I don’t actually own seven different pairs of white boots (“Need to borrow ’em for a pic!”) or travel to a different country every 24 hours (ty, #Latergrams). But my life does kinda rock, partly because I’m a micro-influencer with 50,000 followers on Instagram.  The difference between me and big-time influencers like, say, Kylie Jenner, is that brands give her tons of stuff hoping she’ll post a blurry five-second thank-you snap (which, fair, would be seen by millions of eyeballs). I, on the other hand, am out here spending hours negotiating contracts and creating content Every. Single. Day. Here’s what that’s like.  
 6:30 a.m.  After fighting a losing battle with my sheets, I check my phone. First thing I see when the screen lights up? A dozen DMs. They’re from everyone: my friends, my mom, brand reps. I hit my mom and friends back—low effort (love u!)—before digging into the real stuff. And lemme tell you: There’s nothing more exciting than seeing a brand I know and love pop up in my inbox. I could tell you exactly what I was doing (eating dry cereal straight out of the box) the moment Princess Polly first pinged me, and now I’m, like, BFFs with my girl Steph on their PR team. But I only work with companies whose products are a) things I genuinely want to share with my followers or b) things I really freaking want and know my followers will want too. Eyes half-closed, I respond to my new business DMs with a standard “Email me!” I vow to check my filtered messages (100+) later. I get ready, hop on the train, and start my commute.  8:00 a.m. I spend a glorious hour or so on the train reading a book, blissfully unaware of my phone’s whereabouts. (JK, it’s in my back pocket at all times... but a girl can’t be staring at screens every waking moment.) 9:30 a.m. Once I set foot in the office—I’m an editorial assistant at Cosmo!—I only use my phone if  I’m away from my desk and someone needs me. Believe it or not, I don’t look at Insta at all during the day.   free and easy 🌞 #today A post shared by  S A M   F E H E R (@samanthafeher) on May 5, 2017 at 10:52am PDT  6:00 p.m. I leave for the night and respond to the 10 or 15 DMs that rolled in during the workday. I peek at the requests to see if there’s anything I can respond to without too much effort, like someone asking where my top is from in a recent post. (Tap. The pic. For creds.) Nights are when I spend hours on Instagram creating content, interacting with followers, and talking to brands (mostly fashion labels, up-and-coming beauty lines, and wellness companies). I call this time my Instagram Shift. 6:20 p.m. It’s Monday night, so my phone is getting blown up by Bachelor Nation before I even get home. Part of my schtick is a real-time episode recap on IG Stories, and my followers live for it. Dinner’s an afterthought, but I’ll probs post a food snap I took over the weekend, since nobody wants to see these Cheesecake Factory leftovers.   Need another app to swipe right on? I’m not into Tinder, but find me on #Stunited! 📚📝🔑 #TutoringandChill #linkinbio #ad A post shared by  S A M   F E H E R (@samanthafeher) on Feb 27, 2018 at 3:07pm PST 8:00 p.m.  I half-watch the show as I record reactions for my Insta Story (mostly about that girl who claims she was devastated to be sent home…on night one) and respond to the messages that pour in. (On a typical Monday night, I DM with anywhere from 100 to 200 people.) Literally everyone agrees that Demi’s bathrobe stunt was CrazyTown. 8:30 p.m. I usually post a photo on Instagram every weeknight at 9 p.m.—it’s when my followers are most active, according to my account’s analytics. If I don’t already have a pic lined up, I explore my camera roll for Ghosts of Photo Shoots Past—preferably something nondescript, like a pizza shot, that theoretically could be from today. I spend a few minutes editing (VSCO’s bright C1 filter is Queen) and captioning. If I’m feeling creative, I’ll go with a witty play on words (“slice, slice baby”). Lazy day? It’s gonna be a one-word wonder (“cheesin’”).   same leopard, new spots 🐆 A post shared by  S A M   F E H E R (@samanthafeher) on Jan 4, 2018 at 3:08pm PST 9:00 p.m.  I post the snap and monitor my Likes and comments. Insta is cagey about how its algorithm works, but many influencers notice that the level of engagement your pic gets in the first 20 to 30 minutes determines how well it will perform. The photos that do well for me include my face, food, or fashion. (You’ll notice I listed fries before buys.) I get a thousand-ish Likes and seven comments within an hour.  
 12:00 a.m.  I mentally drag myself for continuing to scroll Instagram despite having to wake up for my IRL job in six hours. Then again, my followers really control the action, so it’s not totally up to me when The Shift is over. Luckily, my morning bev will be caffeinated—and post-worthy.   if it’s an espresso martini, does it count as breakfast food? #jterm A post shared by  S A M   F E H E R (@samanthafeher) on Jan 8, 2018 at 4:14pm PST  Hey, cutie. Just wanted to let you know that this story originally ran in our June issue, so if you like what you see, you should probably snag a hard copy ASAP. Bye!

			 Wow, are you tired? Did you possibly stay up until well past 2 a.m. trying to get your hands on some hawt pieces from Rihanna's new size-inclusive Savage x Fenty lingerie line with no success? If so, you're not alone. Fans took to Twitter to gripe about long wait times, unfulfilled orders, and more last night during the launch, which took place at midnight. So, just to twist the knife even more, I guess, here's everything you couldn't get last night, but maybe have a shot at purchasing (a few styles are still available!) or pre-ordering now: But that was just the lingerie. Here are all the bra styles: So many designs, right? Shop even more styles at savagex.com. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Kaia Gerber Is at NYFW and Killing It Kaia Gerber, the 16-year-old daughter of Cindy Crawford, is now a model, because duh, and she walked in Alexander Wang's Spring 2018 NYFW show. Her outfit is hot and I want it. Also, she really is a lil' Cindy! Respect to Kaia's supermodel mama and Tequila impresario papa Rande Gerber for creating the next gen of models. Speaking of, I'd totally watch a TV show about the kids of the 90s supermodels. Let's go, Hollywood! Chop chop! After the show, Kaia was seen walking in the streets, as that's how these things work. People leave work and they often walk in the streets.     You can't tell from this photo, but Kaia is wearing Alexander Wang's NO AFTER PARTY tights. They're very tight and I want them.

			 Let's just say her first dress was VERY casual.  Meghan Markle married a literal prince on Saturday at Windsor Castle, but for those who are unaware: She was actually previously married. After dating for seven years, Meghan and Trevor Engelson had a Jamaica wedding in 2011, where she wore this strapless gown with a bejeweled belt.  But since separating in 2013, citing "irreconcilable differences" on the paperwork, she later met Prince Harry three years later. Because he's a PRINCE, and in marrying him, she becomes part of the royal freaking family (every girl's dream TBH), it seemed obvious that her next wedding gown would go in a completely different, and more sophisticated, direction. And voilà!  Can you believe just how different these two dresses are? Talk about a transformation! Here's the two side-by-side.  Her first gown was strapless (which is a style not usually worn by royal brides) with a little V-shaped cutout on the bodice and pleating. It also had a rhinestone belt that cinched her waist and featured draped fabric in a column silhouette. But her SECOND dress, just blew this one out of the water.  It was designed by Clare Waight Keller under the fashion house Givenchy, and featured a bateau neck with long sleeves and a flowing train. There's also her gorgeous 16-foot veil, which included flowers from the 53 countries in the Commonwealth, and just looked downright breathtaking. But perhaps not more breathtaking than Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara that she wore to pull the whole look together.    She looks amazing no matter what she wears, but when she showed up in this wedding gown, she looked absolutely regal and it seemed like she was born to be a Duchess.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Now I'm a culottes queen. Hi, my name is Rachel, and I'm a culottes addict. If I'm not wearing jeans or a fun summery dress, you can find me in the cropped, wide-leg pant style, especially during warm-weather months or on vacation. It wasn't always this way. In fact, until I bought this $54 jumpsuit from Lulu's totally on impulse (I liked the leaf motif, OK?) I was convinced the silhouette wouldn't look good on me. I always assumed these kinds of pants would make me appear shorter than I am and that the wide legs would just make me look, well, wider. But my thoughts changed as soon as I zipped up the jumpsuit and looked in the mirror: I seemed taller, the cut accentuated my waist in a nice way, and I even noticed a butt-lifting effect — can't complain about that. Not only did I feel confident, I also felt comfortable — culottes, by definition, are flowy and far less constrictive than your typical skinny jean. And because they're so breezy, I never overheat, even in the hottest temps. Since I purchased the jumpsuit, I've worn it to a few wedding rehearsal dinners, on a couple of date nights, and on pretty much every beachy vacation I've taken. Next up: my tropical honeymoon in December. My favorite way to style it is with a pair of minimalist neutral sandals — the low, chunky heels add an extra few inches to my height. I then belt the outfit, usually with a thin, silver piece, and I also like to wrap a two-tone navy scarf around my shoulders if the weather is chilly or breezy.  Found a textured wall, so naturally... A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on May 5, 2018 at 9:20am PDT I love, love, love it, but obviously I can't keep wearing this same jumpsuit all the time, so now I've got a whole section of my closet devoted to culottes in both trouser and onesie form. I also frequently use my Rent the Runway Unlimited subscription, which has a great selection of cropped, wide-leg options, to experiment with different styles. Come join me in the culotte revolution — shop more styles below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Accio, THIS! Update: June 7, 2019, 9:30 a.m. Wizards and witches everywhere can finally stop waiting for the much-anticipated Vans x Harry Potter collection, because it’s dropping TODAY.  The brand just announced that the new merch hit shelves, and surprise, it’s not just full of footwear. The collection—which is inspired by the four Hogwarts houses—includes backpacks, jackets, other apparel, and Vans shoes (duh).  Take a look at some of the new pics and start plotting what you’ll “accio” up for yourself.    SHOP NOW Update: May 13, 2019, 11 a.m. The wait to see what kind of magic Vans is cooking up with Warner Bros. is OVER. The shoe company dropped the first sneak peek at its brand-new Harry Potter collection today, and I’m fully ready to spend all my galleons on it. In case you somehow missed the initial announcement, the shoes are inspired by the four Hogwarts houses and each gets its own classic Vans silhouette: “a Sk8-Hi for Gryffindor, an Era for Slytherin, Authentic for Ravenclaw, and the Classic Slip-On for Hufflepuff,” according to a company press release. TBD on a launch date, but check them out in the brand-new pic above.  Original story: April 22, 2019, 6 p.m. What do you wear if you’re a Hogwarts-loving witch in 2019? Vans, apparently. The shoe brand announced Monday that it’s dropping a Harry Potter collection sometime in the near future, so get ready to rep your house on your feet!    While details are super under wraps (like, we-still-have-no-photos levels of under wraps), we do know that the collaboration will specifically take inspiration from the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff (as if you needed me to clarify the houses). If you go on the Vans site to check out what little info it’s spilling, you can sign up for a newsletter to get first word once Dumbledore or whoever finally gives the go-ahead for deets to come out. You can also mess with the pretty graphics when you move your cursor, which leaves the site looking like the four house colors underneath water, for some reason.   Something magical coming soon: vans.com/harrypotter A post shared by  vans (@vans) on Apr 22, 2019 at 9:01am PDT SHOP NOW Do I know when this collab is launching? No! Do I know what the shoes even look like? Also no! Do I know I’m ultimately going to buy these shoes and end up rocking a pair of Hogwarts-themed Vans anyway? YES, MA’AM. They’ll look nice with Harry Potter candles and treats, and that’s really all I need to know. Other fans are also pretty pumped about it: VANS IS ABOUT TO DROP A HARRY POTTER COLLAB AND IM HERE FOR ITTTT!!!! pic.twitter.com/4u7lCDshYJ I CAN FINALLY TALK ABOUT HARRY POTTER BEING THE NEXT COLLABORATION WITH VANS AND I COULD CRY!!!!!!!!!! ⚡️⚡️⚡️ Ummm I’m a @VANS_66 collector and a huge Harry Potter fan so this collab is going to be epic! #HarryPotter #vans #vanslife pic.twitter.com/sx8OtfRFZ5  HARRY POTTER VANS? YES. YOU GOT ME VANS. WELL PLAYED.

			 This is a LOOK. You may know that Kourtney Kardashian is currently on an amazing Italian vacation with her three kids and boyfriend Younes Bendjima. You may also be aware that on this getaway she's worn a uniform of mostly teeny bra-tops and wide-leg pants. That all changed on Wednesday, when she opted for some vintage-inspired short shorts and a white bodysuit/one-piece swimsuit, which created a very, very sexy sideboob situation: To be honest, most of the day the whole sideboob effect was largely under wraps, as it was covered by this very vibrant bolero: According to these pics, Kourt grabbed some ice cream with Mason, Penelope, and Reign in this look and then hopped on a boat, which looked like a very good time, mostly because, ahem, Younes looks hella hot:  Ride with U 🌊 A post shared by  Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Jul 3, 2018 at 10:01am PDT Can we just focus on him for a second?  mauvais garçon A post shared by  Younes Bendjima (@younesbendjima) on May 10, 2018 at 10:36am PDT Because, like, what?!  i'm on my way A post shared by  Younes Bendjima (@younesbendjima) on Aug 1, 2017 at 12:34pm PDT Ummmmm.  walup?

			 But not necessarily because of her top. OK, OK, let me catch you up to speed. On Sunday, Kourtney Kardashian posted a picture on Instagram. It was an image of herself eating pizza at a table, which she captioned, "pizza party." In it, she wore a totally see-through mesh shirt and matching sheer tights. This is somewhat noticeable in itself because she looks truly great, and yeah, you can totally see her bra, but what honestly caught my attention more was the way she was sitting? For a while, I actually believed she was reclining in a bathtub, but then the rest of the image didn't really make sense with that idea, so I had to stare more.

			 They're actually the best!! In news you probably know already: The '90s are back, particularly fashion-wise. This is divisive to some, desirable to others. But one thing we can all agree on (other than the fact that tie-dye should never have gone out of style) is that anklets are and always will be gorgeous. And honestly, hooray for this '90s resurgence, because without it, we may have always forgotten that ankle bracelets are actually cool and beautiful and the little subtle sparkle we all need in our lives.   Having a cute sale on select styles through Monday🦋use CODE: body20  See story for details A post shared by  lili_claspe (@lili_claspe) on Mar 29, 2019 at 11:42am PDT  Let's take a moment to thank the powers that be for this renaissance. *Pause for dramatic effect.* Some backstory for ya: A few months ago someone gave me a very pretty anklet. It was gold and had a delicate little moon charm on it. I loved it. It was this exact one: I put it on the day I got it and didn't take it off until it broke after getting caught in the fibers of a blanket. I didn't notice this and moved away from said blanket, thus causing it to snap apart tragically. I wore that thing for two months straight, got so many compliments, and now I'm lost without it.   On to the next 🐆 in the XL Chloe Anklet A post shared by  lili_claspe (@lili_claspe) on Nov 14, 2018 at 7:47pm PST Long story short, I need to shop for a new one, so I'm going to show you all my faves out there right now and you should feel free to shop with me so we can all feel put-together yet understatedly glittery and whimsical at the same time. Because that's what wearing an ankle bracelet does. This is science. Are you on board with me? Quick FYI: Anklets look good with all types of bottoms and shoes. Long skirts and dresses, jeans, culottes, shorts, midis, and minis, pumps, sandals, clogs, mules, heels, and flats—makes 'em all look even better than they'd look on their own!

			 So classic! Well kids, Meghan Markle's wedding dress is here and it is amazing! (What did you expect?) It's a simple, long-sleeve boatneck dress designed by Clare Waight Keller, who last year became the first female artistic director at Givenchy, a designer nobody expected. I have no words other than it's simply f*cking gorgeous.  Want to see it from the back, you say?  Waight Keller designed a 16.5-foot silk tulle veil "representing the distinctive flora of each Commonwealth country united in one spectacular floral composition," Kensington Palace announced in a tweet. British designer Ralph & Russo was long considered to be a front-runner to design the gown — in Markle's engagement photos, she wore a sheer design from the line's 2017 couture collection that reportedly cost $75,000.  Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to release this official portrait photograph to mark their engagement. The photograph was taken by photographer @alexilubomirski earlier this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST Other potential names included Inbal Dior, whose designs were leaked to the press shortly after the engagement announcement; Roland Mouret, a longtime friend of Meghan's; and Kate Middleton favorites Jenny Packham and Erdem, a Canadian brand that People magazine recently reported took its public-relations operations in house and hired a new PR manager. Burberry was also floated as a possible contender, with the Daily Mail reporting in April that company executives attended meetings to "coordinate what has been described as a 'major PR strategy' around a 'high-profile' dress." Then, earlier this week, Stella McCartney's name bubbled back up in the press, following rumors in April after Markle was seen wearing a navy cape dress to the Queen's birthday concert at Royal Albert Hall.  Markle's stylist and BFF, Jessica Mulroney, served as an unofficial wedding planner and helped Markle choose the gown, consulting over the phone and attending dress fittings, royal expert Katie Nicholl told Cosmopolitan.com earlier this week.

			 Designers on both coasts work around the clock in a race to be the first with a replica. In New York City, a team of 30 from bridal designer Madeline Gardner’s company has spent the past five days clocking 12-hour shifts to replicate the two dresses Meghan Markle wore at last weekend’s royal wedding. At the same time, 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles’ Garment District, a handful of people from the bridal line Floravere have been working around the clock to create a design similar to Markle’s Givenchy gown. In an attempt to capitalize on the royal wedding hoopla, designing dresses that typically take months is no easy feat. The race to be the first designer to accurately copy the gown worn by Britain’s newest royal, who brings an estimated net value of $212 million to the brands she endorses, is one filled with hurried decisions, prompt pattern making, swift sewing, and on-the-fly marketing — all to recreate styles that already exist. “It kind of adds a little fun to the whole wedding industry. For us, it’s exciting to present it to brides who want the look,” says Gardner. Markle’s sartorial influence is very real. When she wore an oversize $750 coat from the Canadian brand Line the Label in November to announce her engagement with Prince Harry, the brand’s website crashed — even though they don’t operate an e-commerce portal. In April, she graced the Invictus Games Sydney in a green floral Self Portrait dress accompanied by a black Roland Mouret crossbody bag, both of which sold out shortly after she was seen wearing them. And the blush pink number by the British brand Goat that she wore on Tuesday, in her first official appearance as a royal, is also out of stock. For Gardner, the expeditious process began the moment Markle set foot in public in her white silk, three-quarter-length sleeve gown. “I sat in front of the television and sketched how she came out. When she wore the sexier halter dress in the evening, I sketched that one up as well,” she says. “I actually sketch pretty quickly, so overall it took about half an hour to perfect them all.” Molly Kang, co-founder and CEO of Floravere, set her alarm for the wee hours of the morning on Saturday and went to her designer’s home. “We were obviously all on standby and ready at the crack of dawn, West Coast time, when Meghan walked down the aisle,” says Kang. “I went to my designer’s house at 4 a.m., because no building would let us in at that time.” "I went to my designer’s house at 4 a.m., because no building would let us in at that time." For Kang, the process is less about making a carbon copy and more about providing brides with an option to channel a style similar to Markle's. “Savvy brides want a dress that feels unique,” says Kang. With that in mind, Kang and her team highlighted the aspects about the Givenchy dress that they loved, like the neckline, and revised others, like using a double-bonded silk cady fabric, shortening the sleeves, and hand-sewing buttons down the back. “We preserved the seams and the long lines but modified the A-line silhouette,” says Kang, whose design took about 50 hours to come to life, from sketches to the finished product. Gardner’s goal, on the other hand, was to replicate both styles as closely as possible to the originals, although she noted the fit of Markle’s bateaux-neck ceremony dress could have been tighter or more tapered under the bust. “Meghan may have wanted it that way, but the average bride wouldn’t wear it that loose, so I’ve tapered the bodice,” says Gardner. Luckily for her, because both of Markle’s dresses happened to be on the simple side, the two pieces only took her team — 15 people on each gown — about 60 hours to create. But before Gardner knew what she’d be replicating, her biggest concern was that Markle would choose a fully embroidered design, like the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen creation Kate Middleton wore for her 2011 nuptials to Prince William. “Meghan's gown was about the fabric and the contoured lines and getting the neckline right. It needed to be slightly above the shoulders, yet give the look of an off-the-shoulder, Sabrina neckline,” she says. “Kate’s gown was a bit more challenging due to the intricate and distinctive embroidery used for the delicate bodice and to surround the hemline of the ballgown skirt. Many more yards of fabric were consumed.” Because Gardner promised to get her first samples to J&B Bridal in Chambersberg, Pennsylvania, for an official unveiling this weekend, she’s relieved that the only place she ran into a snag was locating the proper material. “Meghan’s gown was a silk cady, which is a very exclusive woven sateen usually with a crepe backing,” Gardner says. “We didn’t have any on hand so we went on a search to find both the hand feel and texture as well as the weight and sheen. I shopped several fabric vendors until I was able to come up with the one I felt had that rich, wonderful density and look.” Once she and her team got their hands on the desired fabrics, patternmakers, cutters, and sewers got to work creating 250 to 500 copies of the $999 “Duchess” dress. Kang’s designs, meanwhile, typically take two to three months to come to fruition, with a pattern often taking 20 hours alone. She says this week has been a whirlwind for her and her team. “It was a great opportunity,” Kang says of the $1,475 M. Markle gown, available Friday in sizes 0-24. “It’s not that we necessarily want to be first. I’m fairly certain there are overseas factories that have already made knockoffs.” Gardner predicts that both styles will become successful, although she thinks the ceremony dress might be more popular, because it’s what people saw the first time they saw Markle on her wedding day. “So many brides have written me saying they’ve already chosen their wedding dresses and they wouldn’t have looked at such a plain dress but now they’re giving their dresses second thoughts,” she says. Though she’s noticed a resurgence of sleeved gowns over the past year, she hasn’t seen anyone with such a modest, opaque sleeve. "It’s not that we necessarily want to be first. I’m fairly certain there are overseas factories that have already made knockoffs." “It will definitely impact the industry. Nude illusion sleeves have been really popular, and I’ve had so many requests for satin dresses, so there’s a trend there,” she says. And while these two particular styles may not be her best sellers — Gardner reportedly sold just 200 Kate Middleton replicas — Gardner predicts Markle’s influence will nonetheless affect future bride’s trains of thought: “They’ll be a little more open to classic looks.” Fashion brands have long turned to celebrities for design inspiration. More than 15 years ago, Allen Schwartz of the ABS label began making affordable knockoffs of wedding dresses and red-carpet gowns worn by A-listers like Sharon Stone, Halle Berry, Cate Blanchett, and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. “Word got out that I was making all of these $250 to $350 dollar versions of celebrity dresses, and I got a tremendous amount of publicity from it,” says Schwartz.  After appearing on Oprah, Extra and Entertainment Tonight, the designer says he was able to garner tens of thousands of hits in one hour, but the attention didn’t necessarily translate to sales. “A lot of people started making copies cheaply, and mine weren’t cheap, they were nice,” Schwartz says, calling it quits in the copycat department about 10 years ago. “It was taking away from the true value of what Allen Schwartz was about,” he says. “It got old, I didn’t like the stigma, and I felt like I was worth so much more.” Though intellectual property and copyright issues don’t really come into play — designers tend to define their styles as “inspired by” or a “version of” — both Gardner and Schwartz acknowledge that it wouldn’t be impossible for legalities to arise. "These designers are kind of expecting it to happen — I’d take it as an accomplishment and a compliment." “If I were using a specific lace or embroidery, that would be somewhat of an issue, or we’d have to try to use the exact lace, which would make it astronomical,” says Gardner. “These designers are kind of expecting it to happen — I’d take it as an accomplishment and a compliment. It’s never been an issue.” Kang, a self-admitted Markle fangirl, feels her design is different enough from the original to be considered a copy. For her, making the dress was more about highlighting all the things she loves about the newest princess. “We think she stands for similar values and similar things we feel are our ethos,” Kang says. “She breaks rules but respects tradition — she’s independent and feminist.”

			 Make your feet happy, folks. There are lots of cool, stylish, and innovative shoes in the world. From sustainable options to emerging designers and direct-to-consumer companies, scroll on for some of the best footwear brands out there! Loeffler Randall doesn’t only make shoes, but the ones it does make are distinctive, colorful, and dramatic in the best way possible. Take these pretty slides, for example. This brand makes its cute, colorful flats from recycled water bottles originally intended for landfills. Chances are, you’ve heard of this department store staple—and for good reason. Quality design at an affordable cost is nothing to snuff at, ppl! Leith is known for its affordable pieces sold exclusively at Nordstrom, and I’m loving this pearl-dotted blush sandal right here, aren’t you? Yes, designer Tory Burch makes clothing and great purses, but she’s also very well-known for her cute sandals, and the ones right here are no exception. A footbed that molds to the exact shape of your feet over time = a great concept, FYI. Look no further than this brand for on-trend options in all the colors you could possibly want. How could we have a shoe brand roundup without one of the most classic sneaker brands around. I think you may have heard of Chuck Taylors, but have you ever seen them in a prettier yellow? This luxury loafer brand’s pieces are handcrafted in Italy and have a serious cult following. Take a look at Jaggar if you’re interested in standing out in a subtle way. From funky clear strap work to geometric block-heel designs, you’re sure to find something you like. Although it’s most well-known for its adorable wooden bags, Cult Gaia now also sells some of the coolest shoe designs out there. I mean, just look at these yellow mules! Nope, not just the shearling boots anymore! Nike’s been around forever as an athletic sneaker brand, so it’s safe to say you can trust it with your gym style. The brand known for its knee-high wellies also makes short storm-proof Chelsea boots too, FYI!! This company is all about comfort, and wearing any of its shoes is like walking on clouds. These funky high-tops are made from trees, FYI. Trust this brand to make all the trendiest silhouettes—in exactly the colors you need—at way more affordable prices. When Meghan Markle wore this brand’s sneakers on multiple occasions, it solidified its status as a go-to casual summer kick. You may think Dr. Scholl’s makes inserts for more stylish shoes, but the footwear brand actually makes some pretty on-trend styles itself—case in point, these neutral flatforms, which I plan to order stat.

			 Stay ahead of the fashion curve.    We can all agree that new fashion brands and labels are a dime a dozen. Everyone from celebrities to influencers are starting their own lines, and it’s impossible to keep up with them all! But then there are stylish brands from designers who are destined to take the industry by storm and become household names. Here, 26 new clothing brands (or at least new to you, anyway!) that you should keep an eye on. Tombolo, Daily Paper, Sandy Liang, Rotate, Allina Liu, and Still Here, just to name a few, all offer a unique point of view when it comes to design, and we’re sure that they’re going to be the next big thing. Now start adding these brands to your cart before everyone else starts wearing them! Designed in Los Angeles, this sustainable brand can be spotted on fashion editors and influencers alike on Instagram. It launched in 2018 with basics like denim jeans, skirts, overalls, and jackets, but also includes T-shirts, hats, and dresses you’ll wear over and over again.  The L.A.-based label specializes in mixed prints and bold color combinations, like this tie-dye pink and black skirt. It launched in 2016, and has tons of gorgeous pleated designs and standout hues.  Another sustainable brand is Etica, which just launched this year and uses natural dyes and 70 percent less chemicals than other denim companies. It has eye-catching pieces like acid-washed jeans, colorful snake print jackets, and crop-flared overalls, seen here.  *Technically* the Copenhagen label has been around since 2000, but it picked up steam in recent years among the fashion set. It’s still relatively new to the U.S., and it just opened its first stores this year in New York and L.A. You can find animal-printed tops, skirts, and dresses as well as classic wrap midis, statement puff-sleeve blouses, and cute checkered prints.  Founded in 2015 by Jillian Shatken, Saylor specializes in party dresses, but also has comfy sweaters and chic wrap tops. It’s still new enough that your friends will definitely ask you where you got your amazing holiday party look, and you can also find the brand on Rent the Runway, Revolve, Shopbop, and more.  Sarah Staudinger and George Augusto cofounded this label in 2015, and it has serious staying power thanks to its more affordable designer price point and unique creations—think two-toned sweaters, effortless sweater sets, and dainty details like pearls and contrast stitching.  Launching just last year in 2018 at Copenhagen fashion week, this brand focuses on mini dresses in bold prints and textured fabrics. These are OTT outfits that you’ve been dreaming of, and they’ll add major color to your wardrobe.  In case you were wondering, this designer honed her skills while working at The Row, Thakoon, and Rebecca Taylor, so she knows what she’s doing. Allina focuses on elegant designs with comfort, like this chic lace-up Oxford shirt.  While this brand was initially founded in 1994, it relaunched in 2014, and is known for its vibrant prints and colors and deconstructed silhouettes. Definitely browse this label when you need some fun pieces in your closet.  Founded in 2014, Stand Studio has high-fashion leather pieces at more attainable prices than luxury designers. I mean, winter is coming soon and you need an ogle-worthy coat, so this one is IT.  Bernadette is the product of a mother-daughter duo based in Antwerp. The brand focuses on feminine, floral pieces using Italian silk, which explains the price tag, but dang, doesn’t this ’fit look pretty?!  Athleisure chic is definitely a thing thanks to the brand Ernest Leoty, named after one of the sought-after corset couturiers in 19th century Paris.  The workout pieces channel that French sophistication with clean lines and minimal silhouettes, so you’ll be the chicest person at your barre class.  Business in the front, party in the back, amirite? Still Here Denim launched just this year by designer Sonia Beyda Mosseri. The denim line focuses on classic washes and fits, and is customized with her signature hand-painted stripes and chain-stitch embroidery, which adds extra flair.  We can confirm that this will be your fave outerwear piece, but not only is Sandy Liang known for a good fleece, she offers a range of mixed media dresses, re-worked jeans, and actually cool-looking puffer jackets too. Sandy, a native New Yorker, launched her label in 2014 and was influenced by the years she spent growing up on the Lower East Side. For those of you who love a cool T-shirt, we found the perfect one. Dutch Tulip Financial, also known as DTF, is the design-component side of DTFpost. The brand is inspired by hip hop of the ’90s and early aughts, but features shirts and sweaters that make statements about economic and social issues like off-shore tax havens, student debt, and fossil fuels.  The newly launched Leset, which is French for “The Set,” has comfy pieces that are travel-friendly, but also stylish enough to wear out. Take this snake-print cropped cardigan and matching pants, for instance.  This Amsterdam-based brand, first launched with men’s clothing back in 2012, is inspired by the rich heritage of African culture in making its contemporary designs. The three childhood friends, Hussein, Jefferson, and Abderrahmane, added women’s clothing in 2015, and the rest is history. This is guaranteed to be your new favorite brand—just look at this vibrant purple mini!   While Ukrainian designer Anna October launched her label in 2012, she was awarded the Mercedes-Benz Best Designer prize in 2016, and you can find her sophisticated creations on Moda Operandi and Farfetch. Her slip dresses, knits, puff-sleeve blouses, and ruffled tops transition easily from day to night.  Who said the vacation shirt was just for your dad? Tombolo founders Mike and Chris beg to differ. Growing up together in New York City, they launched their unisex line with the idea to make that quintessential touristy shirt more stylish, offering styles with original artwork and retro flair. Willow Smith is already a fan.  Swedish-based line, Aéryne, is modern and whimsical with its breezy dresses and pastel hues. The brand recently decided to end its mass production and now every garment will be made “on-demand” with 100 percent leftover fabric when it’s ordered.  Sisters Brittany and Mia Rothweiler and their good friend David Helwani launched The Range in 2017. The brand offers some of the best ribbed knits and utility pants that are wardrobe staples. It also has seasonless pieces that can be worn year round, and will make you look polished for any occasion.  MaisonCléo, another mother-daughter team, brings you handmade designs that are named after women in their family, using natural fabrics like silk, cotton, and linen.  Featured as an “emerging designer” on Moda Operandi, Anna Quan’s tailored designs offer the perfect fit, yet they’re still casual enough to wear on an everyday basis. The brand definitely follows the “less is more” principle, since most clothes have solid colors and simple silhouettes.  Started in 2014, the Australian label has a sculptural aesthetic from its structured blazers to its draped dresses. It has a wide array of designs that you can wear to work, on the weekend, or for a night out on the town, so there’s something for everyone.  Founded in 2014, Normaillot  is focused on beachwear and swimsuits that are anything but basic, from cutout one-pieces seen here to cropped jackets that coordinate with its printed bikinis. We’re sure that you’ll see these cool suits on your Insta feed when it gets warm again.  London-based label, Ssōne, features a neutral color palette with pops of color and utilitarian designs like this zip-up jumpsuit. Founded in 2018 by Caroline Smithson, the brand also follows sustainable practices like recycling textiles and reusing unsold garments.

Here's the first one that appears in her feed:  She looks great! But in a classic Kim move, the photo was just the beginning of her bikini pic journey. She also appeared in snaps with older sister Kourtney, who tagged along with her BF Younes Bendjima (and who also had a plethora of sexy swimsuit Instagram posts).  They might be responsible for a visor comeback this summer, just saying.  But Kim really upped the ante when she posted a selfie wearing a hot pink two-piece. If  you don't start the morning with a mirror selfie, are you really a Kardashian?  The reason for all these sexy bikini photos? Kim's put a LOT of work into her body. She detailed in the below caption that she "spent a whole year training so hard 5 or 6 days a week." She thanked her trainer, Melissa Alcantara, for her new lifestyle, which includes waking up at 5 a.m. to do body-building workouts and sprints.  So there you have it!

			 Welcome to Instagram vs. Reality!  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Ten bucks I can guess what you were doing before reading this post rn: You were scrolling through Instagram and mentally bookmarking all the ridiculously trendy outfits that can only be trendy in a purely ~Instagram~ way that popped up as sponsored posts on your feed, right? I mean, if you weren’t, then kudos to you. But I was! And do! Like, more than once an hour, TBH. But the thing is, do we ever really trust anything we see on Insta ads? Like, why should we? It’s an ad. It’s supposed to be trendy and pretty, hellooooo.  So that’s why we’re here! In our brand-new series Instagram vs. Reality, fashion editor and IG queen Rachel Torgerson sacrifices herself (and our dime) to help you figure out which trendy Instagram brand is actually worth the $ before you whip out your debit card. First up: cool-girl brand Reformation. You’ve definitely seen Ref’s sundresses and puffy-sleeve fancy blouses everywhere from New York to L.A. to Selena Gomez to probably every other influencer when you mindlessly scroll through your feed. For the purpose of this experiment, Rachel orders a dress, jeans, and a shirt. The trifecta, if you will! 
 So, how do the items come packaged? Are there any iffy hems? Weird smells? Seams where you didn’t think there would be seams? And what about that sizing guide? Is it, like, actually accurate and not just accurate for a Very Stylish mannequin? Can Rachel (and you!) potentially wear this minidress to an upcoming wedding? Spoiler alert: Reformation is legit. But it is a little pricey and you may be taking a step back to think a bit before you splurge. Which, fair. Sooo watch this video to help you decide. Wink wink, nudge nudge, you get the idea.

			 Stun-ning. Jennifer Lawrence looked incredibly gorgeous in a gold gown at the 2018 Oscars. Take a gander at this major metallic moment:   So sparkly! So pretty! All the heart-eyes emojis. Since the dress was so glittery on its own, J-Law seemingly didn't need to do much more to make it shine. She accessorized with a delicate bracelet and a colorful ring, keeping her neck bare. Here's the look close up. Digging the spaghetti straps! The side view of this gown is also striking.

			 Computer? Check. Charger? Check. Giant thermos of coffee? Double check.   Yes, a black leather bag is a classic for work, but it's not the end-all-be-all of office accessories. Don't be afraid to add some color or choose an unexpected silhouette! Here, 20 professional bags (they'll fit your laptop and then some) that are cute enough to wear even after hours.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Faux-suede never looked so good. This mustard-colored bag has a zipper to keep your things secure and a detachable cross body strap if it gets too heavy to hold as a top handle.  A smooth faux-leather tote with a marbled handle looks ultra-sophisticated, but it also has an extra long (but adjustable!) strap so you can carry it on your shoulder if needed.  Backpacks aren't just for school anymore! This vegan brown leather one with silver hardware looks just as elegant as any tote or satchel—with the added benefit of being hands-free.    This lightweight duffle is also expandable, which comes in handy if you're also trying to fit in a gym outfit for a post-work sweat sesh. Also, because it's made from a cushiony neoprene, any fragile items or electronics will be safe. This work bag isn't like most, mainly because it's ~circular~. If you want a style that stands out from the rest, but still want one you can wear with everything, opt for this shape in black. It also has convenient interior card slots and zipper pouches so you'll be organized.  For the worker who is always traveling, this bag in pretty pink leather is designed to slide over the handle of  your carry-on luggage, so it can come to work with you—wherever you are in the world.  A work bag doesn't have to be lacking in personality. You can customize this tote with a monogram and any color bold stripe. The cute personalized touches aside, there are also interior pockets for your wallet, keys, sunglasses and even enough room left over for your laptop.  From a backpack to a shoulder, bag this neutral-colored satchel with adjustable straps can just about do it all.  The easy-to-access front pockets are perfect for your lipstick and keys, while the inside fits, well, just about everything else you'll need to hit the office.  This minimal leather tote comes in three other shades and resembles a shopping bag, except it's leather and way sturdier. It's also made from 65 percent recycled cotton, has two interior pockets, and can fit an 11-inch iPad.  The original classic work bag, the Le Pliage tote by Longchamp is a a style that many women have for a reason—it goes with any outfit! Also a plus? The nylon material keeps water out so your belongings are protected if it unexpectedly starts raining.  Don't like schlepping a huge tote with you everyday? Then opt for this scaled-down silhouette. It'll still fit all the necessities without the pain of having to dig to the depths of your bag to find your wallet.  Cleverly made with two handle lengths, you can carry this tote by the hand OR on your shoulder with the long straps. The contrast red lining also gives it an subtle dose of color.  The quilted nylon material makes this work tote super light. It comes in endless color combinations and solids as well, so you can pick a color that works for your usual office ensembles.  A leopard-printed style is anything but boring. Since it has neutral tones, it's a lot more versatile then you think, and it's big enough that it can double as a weekend bag for short trips. Genius.  The two-tone colorway means this bag goes with double the outfits; plus, you can wear it over your shoulder or use the top handle. The geometric shapes of this crossbody sets it apart from the rest but it's also extremely practical reasons thanks to its extra pockets and thin shape that easily stores away.  If you love yourself a logo, Tory Burch totes are an instant classic and perfect for the office, yet pretty enough that you'll want to wear them everywhere else.  This bright color adds some fun to this everyday bag, but it also comes in 12 other shades for more options.  It includes a removable leather pouch to keep your smallest items secure (so, no, you won't lose yet another chapstick!) and still has plenty of room to store your laptop, makeup bag, wallet, and more.  A classic leather hobo never goes out of style. This beautiful bag, with it's whipstitch details and tassels, will only get better with age. It fits in perfectly at the office, but still looks cute with your weekend 'fit.  This metallic pewter hue is a great way to add some character to an everyday tote.

And uh, with over 7,000 reviews that mostly consist of people being like "this! coat! is! a! lifestyle!" that seems like a steal? BTW, in case you're one of the few people that hasn't been trolling Amazon and waiting for this coat to go on sale, here are a few helpful stats: It's filled with extra-warm white duck down and feathers, is equal parts cozy and cute, happens to be both windproof and waterproof, and has a bunch of pockets for storing all your crap without looking bulky. Also the sides un-zip so you can loosen it if you happen to be wearing a million extra sweaters. I'm sold, bye.

			 Everything's under $100! Let's have a moment of silence for the end of summer. But even though it's over, there is a glimmer of hope: the beloved fall wardrobe. From long sleeves and chunky knits to scarves and boots, it comes with lots of sartorial perks. Scroll on for trendy dresses under $100 that are perfect for the dropping temps and crisp air. While a high neck and long sleeves are perfect as temperatures begin to drop, a sequined cuff and hemline keeps things light and fun.  Now that you're more inclined to spend time indoors, opt for heavier materials and sophisticated silhouettes, like the asymmetrical hemline of this cute cold-shoulder number. It’s time to layer up! Corduroy is a fall staple, and this dress can be paired with a turtleneck to complete the perfect collegiate look when class is back in session. Enter your next big presentation totally confident in a sweater dress with a work-appropriate slit. Plus, its sparkly finish will add an extra element of fun to the office grind.  The autumn is the best time to grow your professional network in a low-key but elegant knit maxi. Not ready to give up the flirty shoulder cutout look you’ve been rocking all summer? Try the style in a maxi dress with long sleeves—extra points for a rich, autumn-y shade like emerald green.  Enjoy exploring the offerings of a rich autumn harvest in a fully lined, button-down shift dress that pairs perfectly with tights and a pair of Doc Martens.   If that summer fling looks like it’ll last a few more seasons, it may be time to meet the parents. This long, fitted design with a contrast collar is stylishly sensible for when you decide to take the next step.  Flutter sleeves and a below-the-knee hemline make this the perfect ensemble for most wedding dress codes—plus, the out-of-the-box color combo will make a statement. New season, new you. Experiment with knotted mini in a deep, navy hue that will set the tone for an evening drink.  Leather can feel oppressively hot in the summer, but it is perfect for fall. Head out to lunch (or brunch) with your buds in this cute overall dress. There's nothing like the crisp fall air, so venture out for a walk in a simple, striped jersey dress that works with a pair of boots and a fashion-forward belt bag.  Meet your pals for a latte in a color-blocked, long-sleeved number that’ll keep you warm until Christmas.  Keep it sexy in a dress with a plunging neckline and a flirty print, but choose longer sleeves to stay warm. Pair this look with a bootie or sandal (depending on the weather) and you’re ready to party.

			 You have been warned. Over-the-knee Uggs are definitely about to become a Thing. Remember a while back when these thigh-high, flat-soled Uggs appeared at Y/Project's runway show during Paris Fashion Week: Mens? It was a lot to take in. Just so you know, the label — known especially for its funky, re-worked denim — hasn't finished its love affair with over-the-knee Uggs. In fact, it's doubling down on the trend and has created a version with heels, which appeared on the runway at regular Paris Fashion Week on Thursday. They're kind of amazing — see for yourself:   Let's zoom in a little closer on these bad boys. The eye-catching footwear debuted in both camel and black colors — but it wasn't limited just to thigh-highs. The fashion house also showed heeled Ugg mules and slouchy below-the-knee boots. Some styles were folded in half. Whether you're an Ugg hater or lover, there's no denying how warm and toasty you'd feel in the middle of the winter with a pair of these on your feet/calves/quads/inching slowly up your body and taking over your life.  It seems important to let you know that these one-toe-exposed pumps were featured on this runway too: Please, discuss this important footwear update amongst yourselves.

			 Her "late night look" was completely see-through. Kate Upton got married to Justin Verlander in November 2017, but she's only just shared some intimate snaps taken at her evening celebration that reveal the second dress she wore on her big day. And her evening look is a lot racier than the classic gown she wore earlier on. Simply captioned, "Late night look," Upton showcased her sheer evening gown, which gave her a totally naked look for the evening reception. She first showed a picture of the dress from the back, looking absolutely stunning as always. But if you scroll through her Instagram post to see the dress from the front, the gown is simply jaw-dropping, and extremely revealing, complete with just-visible nude underwear: The model finished her photo set with a super sweet photo of her new husband kissing her forehead. Upton wed professional baseball player Justin Verlander in Castiglion del Bosco in the Province of Siena in Tuscany, Italy, in November last year. For the ceremony itself, Upton wore a white lace gown with long sleeves: The setting itself was filmic, and looked like the most idyllic location anyone could choose for their wedding: The place settings were rustic yet classic: And the venue for the reception was magical, and wouldn't have looked out of place in a Disney movie: The couple got engaged in 2016, and Upton told E! News at the time, "I’m really excited, he asked me right before season started so we’ve been keeping it on the down low for quite a while. So I’m excited to finally be able to share it with the world!"  And on her choice of gown, Upton told PeopleStyle that her husband would approve of whatever she wore on the big day, saying, "Justin is so supportive and I don’t think that he would honestly have a strong opinion in that way. He’s a lover, not a judger."

			 Living that open-toe life. Guys: Warm! Weather! Is! Here! (Well, almost, at least!) And that means...it's open-toe time. Yes, sandal season is here to cure all our left-over winter doldrums. Scroll on for the shoe brands your warm-weather wardrobe absolutely neeeeeeds to know about. Mango is all about making all the latest trends accessible and affordable. These barely-there straps with gem-like lucite block heels will put you in a great mood all summer long.  Australian brand By Far has a minimalist aesthetic, but that doesn't mean its styles lack glitter. Take these sparkly shoes, for instance.  Zara is obviously known for more than sandals, but their shoes are so on-trend, they shouldn't be overlooked. These super fun snakeskin ones will without a doubt put an edge to your outfit.  J.Crew knows how to take a classic style and add just enough cool details to make it stand out. Check out the sweet lavender hue and eye-popping buckles on these standard slides. H&M has a ton of stylish, affordable footwear, FYI. These thin-strapped wrap sandals are the perfect example, IMO. Each pair of Mystique shoes are handmade by Balinese artisans, and with amazing add-ons like these trendy seashells, it's not too hard to imagine this pair on the beach.   Yuul Yie—a Korean brand known for its pops of color and unique silhouettes—has been around since 2010. I think you can agree: These are not your typical pink mules. E8 by Miista, an affordable extension of contemporary accessory brand Miista, offers super cute and sweet sandal options. I don't know about you, but this gingham pair makes me want to go on a chic picnic, stat.  If you didn't know about Zara's sister brand Uterque, which serves up the same kinds of affordable, super-trendy styles, now you do and also you're welcome. This pair of sandals from the label has a sleek design that compliments the silhouette of your feet while adding a bit of flair with the pearl details.  Yes, Tory Burch sells more than shoes, but its branded flip flops are staples at the beach. I'm also a big fan of these eye-catching gladiators.  Dr. Martens...the king of sturdy, chunky shoes. These giant dad sandals are here for you if you want to give off a tougher vibe.  If you're into wicker, raffia, and straw accessories, better check out Dolce Vita, a label founded in 2001. If you do, you'll find the best sandals for any trip to the beach, including these sweet woven mules.  Super chic heeled sandals for under $50?? I'm sold. When it comes to keeping up with the latest trends for unbeatable prices, ASOS takes the cake.  Qupid is all about what you wear every day, and comfort is key. Try these very pretty light-blue flip-flop/slide hybrids on for size!

			 We gotchu!   Not to state the obvious, but teenage boys are hard to read. If you’re struggling to shop for the teen boy in your life, I’ve got a trick for you: Stick with the ’90s. Between windbreaker jackets, plaid shirts, and Nintendos, shopping for the youth of today feels exactly like it did two decades ago (you know, when they weren’t even alive yet). But because you’re already here, I’ve gone ahead and rounded up some great gift ideas to get you started. Whether the guy you’re shopping for loves the outdoors, holing up in his bedroom, being funny, or spending all his time on social media, you’re sure to find something below that he’ll like. Keep scrolling to shop the 36 best gifts for teen boys. As a teen, he might still live at home with his parents, but there’s no reason he can’t make his room feel like his own space. Get him these LED lights so he can match it to his ~vibe~. Nice sweatpants are always a good gift idea, but if you refuse to spend $100 on a pair of sweats (seriously, why are some so expensive?), get him this pair of fleece joggers that looks like they cost way more than they did. Nothing is worse than fumbling with your fallen phone cord in the middle of the night, and any teenager who uses their phone too much knows that. This small wireless dock, which is compatible with iPhone, Samsung, LG, and more, makes charging their devices so much easier. If there’s anything teens like, it’s The Office. If he spends most of his time watching episodes in his room, he’d appreciate this door sign for sure. He’ll love to skate around on this baby, which can conveniently fit into his backpack when he’s not using it. He’s been begging to get these wireless headphones, so this is an easy idea that you know he’ll use every day. Fact: Teenagers love sleeping. If your teen boy frequently sleeps through his alarm, get him this gag gift (that you’re actually kinda serious about). He’ll actually wake up on time every morning thanks to the sound of this contraption buzzing on his nightstand. The only thing teenagers love more than sleeping is going to music festivals. Gift this handy little survival kit (which comes with a poncho, earplugs, a flashlight, and more) or pair it with a festival pass for the most ~fyre~ gift. If the guy’s ever boarded a plane only to find out his AirPods aren’t compatible with the in-flight entertainment, he’d appreciate this flight adapter. Just plug this little guy into the plane’s headphone jack, and he’s good to watch all the movies he wants. Usually the gift of new socks is boring, but I dare someone to call this set of six pairs in assorted neon colors basic. And who better to pull them off than a teenage boy? If he overuses his deodorant spray, introduce him to the world of luxury fragrance with this sampler set. No need to splurge on a designer cologne either. This comes with five best-selling scents that he can toss in his gym bag, locker, backpack, and wherever else for a quick spritz. If he’s a jewelry person, a wrap bracelet with a metal clasp is a good go-to that he can wear every day. A phone case that costs more than 30 bucks might sound ridiculous to you, but if he’s obsessed with all things Off-White and spends 99 percent of his time on his phone, this one’s for him. Whether the guy is into sports or just loves a good game, this at-home basketball arcade setup is a gift that’ll definitely get used. It comes with 2 hoops, 7 basketballs, and 16 different game settings—everything you need for some friendly competition. He might not have been born in the ’90s, but he still has an appreciation for the simpler times when windbreakers ruled the world. He’ll definitely love this lightweight vintage-inspired jacket. This isn’t just your average beanie! This one comes in eight shades and features a fold-over cuff that he can double to fit both his head and his style. Not old enough to drive yet? He’ll love to ride this baby around the neighborhood, thanks to its smooth gear shifts, comfortable seat, and minimal silhouette. (It’s better for the environment too!)  I’ll bet you five bucks the teenager you’re shopping for already owns a pair of these classic sneakers. And I’ll bet you another $5 he wears them so much that he needs a new pair to replace his worn ones. Similar to the Nintendo Switch but smaller and newer, this Lite version is the perfect gift for any gamer to take on the go. Did the guy you’re shopping for just get his braces off? Then he’ll be v thankful for this teeth-whitening kit, which comes with 10 trays and a whitening pen, to even out the stains left behind. He’ll appreciate a unique belt with a quick-release buckle that’ll make his distressed jeans that much cooler. Area 51, anyone? Any teen guy would love some NASA merch, like this bold graphic tee. If he’s the outdoorsy type, a tent that can fit four queen-size air mattresses would be perfect for a trip with all his friends. Bonus: He can easily set this bad boy up in 60 seconds. If he just turned 16 and got a car, he’ll need a key ring to go with his new car keys, and this cool braided one will only set you back eight bucks. If the guy lives in sweats and streetwear, he’d be into an oversize pullover hoodie. Bonus points if it also has a Champion logo somewhere on it. This pomade strikes the perfect balance of styling cream and sea salt and will give your guy the best texture for his flow. Can he really have too many medium-wash jeans? Answer: No. The limit does not exist. If he lives in athleisure, formal clothes are probably a no-go. A plaid button-down shirt like this is nice enough to wear to dinner but still casual enough that he could wear it with his sweats. Fact: Every teen guy likes music. There’s nothing like a speaker to get the parental-supervised party goin’, and if he likes having his friends over, he’ll want a super-portable one that everyone can connect to via Bluetooth. The time is fast approaching for him to learn the art of shaving. The special rings on this electric shaver protect the skin from redness and irritation. Plus, it comes with a precision trimmer for an even sharper look. Whether he surfs, waterskis, or likes to kayak, he’ll no doubt get a lot of use out of a floating dry bag like this. Consider this the OG Instagram. If your teen has an old soul, he’d appreciate an actual camera to document all his hangouts and trips with his friends. A denim jacket is a great wardrobe staple, but the traditional blue can feel unoriginal. Get him a faded black denim one like this to boost his edge factor. When shopping for people who are difficult to please (ahem, teen boys), stick with the classics. These boots will go just as well with his go-to sweatpants as they would with a pair of jeans. Not exactly the most exciting gift, but if the guy spends a lot of time on his phone, this external battery pack is a great practical gift that he’ll get a lot of use out of. If he’s been taking his guitar practice more seriously lately, treat him to this electric guitar. Just don’t buy him an amp if he lives with you.

			 Sorry, not sorry, gingham! Quickly and quietly, pretty much every major e-comm site you shop made this one subtle change: They added a bunch of smocked fabric offerings to their new arrivals, leaving less room for summer's former queen of trends, gingham. (No shade to gingham, I still love it.) In case you didn't know, smocked fabric is the kind that's all bunched up (in, like, a nice way) and sewn with elastic thread so it can stretch. That usually means the garment in question is skintight all over or has an expandable area that can accommodate a variety of shapes within a given size. The rise of this kind of sewing detail makes sense, given the triumphant return of everything '90s to fashion right now. Head to any online shopping destination and you'll see smocked crop tops and bralettes, jumpsuits, skirts, and dresses with other trends from the era, like platform sandals and skinny shades. So, should you be into it? Uh, yeah. There are a lot of pros to this. First, like I said earlier, smocking makes it more likely that a piece of clothing will suit your measurements without tailoring, even if you traditionally have trouble with fit due to your chest or hip size.  Second, tops that are smocked in the front mean you don't have to wear a bra (your nips won't poke or show through thinner lining, because the fabric is thicker), which—hallelujah!  Third, items that have this detail are usually convertible, meaning you can wear them in more than one way. Not into straps? Push 'em down and you've got an off-the-shoulder look. Think the tube top would look better as a skirt? Try that sh*t out and see! The possibilities are endless. Lastly, it just looks really cool. That part you can see for yourself if you scroll on. So, um, what are you waiting for? Smock it up by shopping the styles below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 (Which is really saying something.) Oh, man. Dads are great, right? They tell all sorts of terrible jokes and they just want the best for you. That's why, when the holidays roll around, you want to make sure they feel loved with super thoughtful gifts. That's a ton of pressure! But it shouldn't be too hard for you, because you've landed here! And there happen to be 50 amazing gift ideas for dads literally right below this introduction.  Also, in case you're interested in shopping for others, check out our gift guides for moms, sisters, teens, and even best friends!  Okay, we’re obviously on a BBQ theme here, but stay with me. If he’s the kind of guy who loves to spice things up, he may get a real kick out of this make-your-own-hot-sauce kit. Trade in his basic workbag for one that’s not only sleek but also water-resistant and made to last. Do him a favor and gift him a set of five funky pairs of socks. Then make sure he throws away his old, ratty pairs. ...and a protective leather case connected to a keychain means the AirPods’ charging station will never be too far away. A camel-colored briefcase goes with everything, and this sleek, minimalist one will get him all the compliments. A nice razor with travel-size shave cream and after shave will be a blessing when he's jet-setting. For a dad on the go, a set of bags that keeps all his necessities separate and organized would be a great gift. Does he have that one place on the couch that’s distinctively his? Make it a little more homey with this portable table that’ll attach to any couch or chair arm. If he wants to be cool, he obviously needs to ditch the cords—get him up to date with some original AirPods. If his phone is always running out of battery, give him a little extra juice with this slender portable charger. Any poker player would be excited to get this fun two-pack set of playing cards. For those lazy days, he’ll def love the new Kindle, which is also waterproof! He’ll get some real mileage out of a backpack-cooler hybrid he can take camping, tailgating, or just out in the backyard. If he’s an avid golfer, a set of Titleist golf balls personalized with his name or initials will put a major smile on his face. If he always has his computer with him, consider gifting a profesh-looking pouch that will keep it protected from scratches and the elements. And if he’s into grilling, he could always use an upgrade to his barbecue utensils. A slide that molds to his feet will be a go-to all summer long. If your dad is all about creating the perfect playlist for every occasion, a portable Bluetooth speaker is just the thing for him. It’s even water-resistant so he can bring it to the beach, pool, boat, or really anywhere outdoors. A dad who constantly talks about the good ole days of music would love to receive one of these. Traveling is hard as it is, so why not get him everything he could possibly need on the road, like cleanser, facial moisturizer, body wash, deodorant, and more? A clean freak will definitely get some use out of a robot vacuum that is Amazon Alexa compatible. If he’s the type who likes subtle jewelry, a double-loop braided bracelet with silver accents will look right at home around his wrist. If he’s always bragging about his perfectly done hamburgers and ribs, why not surprise him with a portable grill that still packs a punch? Help him take care of his skin with this kit from men’s skincare fave Jack Black. It includes a cleanser, a moisturizer, a lip balm, and an exfoliating scrub. He’ll look radiant! This wooden water bottle is a handsome accessory he can take from the gym to his desk and beyond. If he loves strong coffee in the morning, invest in a heavy-duty espresso maker that comes with a frothing pitcher, tamping tool, and measuring spoon. He’ll use it all the time. Amp up his spring and summer style with a pair of colorful boat shoes. If your dad is like most dads, his swimwear could definitely use an upgrade. Consider gifting him a blue pair in a sweet chevron pattern that'll be perfect for his next vacation. He’ll think it’s great that these sneaks are not only sustainably made but also designed with serious comfort in mind. Is he always down for a glass of wine with dinner? He’ll love this Bordeaux blend; you’ll love the price. His favorite spirit would look dang classy in this crystal piece. He can keep it all organized in a color-blocked accessory with 10 card slots, 2 interior slip pockets, and 2 bill compartments. Yeah, ties can be a boring gift, but promise you, he most likely needs a new one that’s stylish and goes with anything. Here you go. What better gift than a coffee mug to pair with an espresso machine? Remind him that he’s obviously the best with a morning brew staple. He won’t want to take these slippers off because they’ll keep his feet warm with a shearling lining. Plus, the rubber sole makes them great for outdoor wear if he needs to grab the newspaper in the morning. This gunmetal-color device will keep his favorite bottle of rosé, white, or bubbles at the optimal temp for hours. He’ll enjoy the great outdoors even more with UVA- and UVB-protected sunnies that have scratch-resistant lenses. If beach or lake vacations are a frequent occurrence for your dad, he’ll absolutely benefit from a pair of water shoes that’ll protect his feet from rocks and other objects as he has fun in the sun. A trendy jacket with plenty of pockets will make him look like the hip dad he already thinks he is. Your dad can do it all (or not do a thing) in these cool cotton-blend fleece sweats. It’s time he replaced his trusty old belt with one that’s not falling apart, right? This one is reversible with brown and black leather, so he can match it to whatever he’s wearing. Letting you in on a secret: Every guy looks immediately more stylish in a chic turtleneck. Your dad will appreciate the upgrade. He’ll like the fact that these black suede gloves with knit details also have touch-screen capability. Give dad a classic style with a leather strap and silver accents.  Keep cold weather at bay and your pops extra cozy in this camel-color woven scarf. Is he the type who loves taking embarrassing photos of you and your siblings? Then he’ll appreciate a compact camera with instant sharing capabilities through Wi-Fi. A comfortable yet stylish update to basic khaki pants will make him feel right on trend. A cologne with notes of cedar, sandalwood, and citrus will become his new favorite scent if he likes deeper, earthy smells. If he’s all about comfort, a cozy PJ shirt and matching bottoms will be so up his alley. Give him a pair of headphones that deliver amazing sound quality and are comfortable enough to wear all day long.

			 The first Fall '18 collection is filled with classics. On Wednesday, Amazon Fashion announced that it's launching J.Crew Mercantile, a line of clothing for women and men in its first-ever partnership with the brand. J.Crew lovers will find a pared-down version of their everyday basics from tees and denim jackets to jeans in the fall '18 collection. In addition, all pieces in this line are under $300 and ship for free. (For comparison, you can get a pair of jeans from the Mercantile collection for $50 versus $75 on J.Crew's website.)  Though J.Crew might fully be on board with having its products on the giant e-commerce site, according to The Wall Street Journal, some brands are "worried that Amazon will use sales data to launch less-expensive imitations of their products" or fear that "listing items on Amazon reduces shoppers’ incentive to visit physical stores." This news shouldn't come as a surprise; Amazon is the number two player in the U.S. apparel industry (trailing just behind Walmart) and already offers other prominent labels such as Nike and Calvin Klein on the website. Just recently, Zappos, which is owned by Amazon, developed a relationship with streetwear brand Concept as a way to tap into the "cool" side of footwear. With these new business opportunities, Amazon Fashion is out to crush the apparel game. Check out some of the Amazon x J.Crew offerings, ahead.

			 Anyone else still dreaming about that white silk gown? 😍 Meghan Markle's Claire Waight Keller Givenchy wedding gown caused huge buzz—from allegedly being called an Emilia Wickstead rip off to getting criticized by Katy Perry — but everyone can agree that her white evening gown, which she wore to hop in her and Harry's "Just Married" Jaguar, was nothing short of glorious.   The scene-stealing custom silk dress was designed by Stella McCartney, and in an interview with ELLE UK, the designer talked about the real reason she thinks Meghan asked her to make the iconic white gown.  “I have had moments in my career where I’ve caught up with Gwyneth [Paltrow]or Madonna and was like, ‘Can I dress you for that?',” said the designer. “But this time around, they were drawn to me. [Meghan] approached me."  "I think Meghan chose me for reasons other than just a beautiful dress — plenty of people can do that. And I think, obviously I am a British designer, but I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part." Meghan has a good relationship with the designer, but McCartney said she still felt lucky to have been chosen for this huge opportunity. "I was honored and I still am."  Aside from the reception dress, the Duchess of Sussex wore a Stella McCartney cape dress for the Queen's 92nd birthday in April, and a tie-waist coat in January for her visit to Cardiff. The designer was also proud to say that both Oprah and Amal Clooney's standout looks at the Royal Wedding were also from her label. "They are all women’s women. It’s a big deal," she said.

			 Ready to get sooooo comfy. For those of you who love sleep (if my calculations are correct, that’s basically everyone, right?), I have some news: Parachute—aka your fave bedding brand—just released a line of cozy pajamas. Honestly, I feel like taking a nap rn just looking at them. (Sorry to my boss.) The pj’s, which are available to shop now on the site, are unisex and include a sleep shirt and a button-up set both made from 100 percent cotton. Sounds like heaven, right?  SHOP NOW Last month, the brand recently collaborated with A.L.C. to create silk pj’s (and robes, pillowcases, and eye masks), but these new cotton styles are Parachute’s own and have a more affordable price point.  The Gauze Sleep Shirt ($99) features a minimal Henley-inspired top with a drop-tail hem for additional coverage. It’s like the baggy T-shirt’s classier cousin. (That dropped hem will def be helpful when you’re picking up that Uber Eats order in your pj’s and you don’t wanna be judged for your lack of pants, just sayin’.) The collection comes in sizes S through L and is available in three muted colors of light gray (Fog), dark gray (Slate), and dark green (Surplus). FYI, the fit is supposed to be relaxed, but if you don’t want it too oversize, opt for a size down. 
  SHOP NOW Then there’s the Gauze Pajama Set ($149), which includes a long-sleeve button-down top and comfy lounge pants with a drawstring and tapered elastic hem. As the weather gets colder outside and you trade in your light sheets for your winter ones, it only makes sense to dress warm for sleep too. This set is also cute enough to wear outside of bed, like when you’re bingeing Rhythm + Flow on Netflix or venturing outside for a quick dog walk. This set comes in the same three hues as the sleep shirt but also includes sizes XS and XL.  Since the styles are unisex, don’t forget about your boo! Y’all can have matching pj’s while cuddling up on your sofa as the snow falls outside and, wow, the thought of that is almost too cute for me.  Basically, if these are as comfortable and soft as Parachute’s top-rated luxury sheets, then I’ll definitely be dreaming about these pajamas until they arrive at my door.

			 Just look at all these amazing sleeves!!! Prom styles come and go, and every year a trend sweeps the dress department at your local mall. From overwhelming rhinestone bodices to extra-large sleeves, here are the styles that defined each year.  Shiny, shimmery fabrics were *very* '80s, and in this year they especially were the trend everyone was wearing. It definitely would make it hard for your date to miss you on the dance floor.  Scoop-neck dresses were all the rage in '89. Bonus points if they happened to be bright pink and worn with matching shoes.  Nothing says 1990 more than satin rosettes across the neckline of a prom dress. This girl even wore opera-length gloves for added drama.  The year 1991 was all about a good, old-fashioned square neckline — as seen on this dress. Who needs rhinestones and bright colors, anyway? Huge sleeves are probably the most iconic #throwback prom trend – this girl's dress featured extremely large black sleeves on top and a white tulle skirt. Petition for this style to make a comeback, please.  A belt across the waist is a style you really don't see anymore, but in '93 they were *the* thing. Also, the green lamé fabric of this girl's dress is absolutely killing it.  Black and white is a classic color combo, but it really had a moment in the mid-'90s. Here, this girl wears a strapless black number with white lace detailing and gloves.  Not only does this dress have its own matching choker, but this young woman also wore sheer pantyhose and black pumps for a look that was just *so* 1995. Now that the choker trend is back in full swing, you may see this prom dress style again sooner than you think.  Velvet dresses were trendy in the '90s grunge culture, and while it might seem like an unexpected fabric choice for a prom dress now, in '96 it was so popular. Take, for instance, this girl's black velvet skater dress.  Rhinestones and beads hit prom season hard by '97. You'd be hard-pressed to find a gown without an OTT beaded bodice and straps, like these two navy numbers.  You can't talk about the '90s without discussing spaghetti straps, and such was the case with the prom dresses from '98 – these super-thin straps became the undisputed, year-defining trend.   Everyone gravitated toward pink in '99. (Just think of everything Paris Hilton wore that year.) It also was the hottest hue to hit prom season — and hey, it definitely would make you stand out in all those pics!  Whether or not chiffon shawls actually keep you warm, they nevertheless were a Thing in 2000. This young woman paired hers with a deep purple dress.  This draped neckline, as seen on the right, was a major hit in the early aughts, which also is coincidentally the only time period you could spot jersey dresses at prom.  I guarantee that you have worn (or seen) this shade of aqua at some point in your high school lives, and it completely dominated proms in 2002. Shoulder shawls remained popular, too, as seen on the woman on the left. The dresses of '03 were great because they all had the same beaded pattern that connected at your waistline. Plus, the embellishments added something extra to the classic empire-waist silhouette. Asymmetrical one-shoulder dresses were the It Look in 2004, and this red-hot gown was no exception.  Prom-goers in 2005 loved this gorgeous yellow-green color. Just look at how much fun these two are having!  Behold: four strapless dress-wearing girls in the same photo. Two gowns are pink, one is white, and one is red, but what they all have is common is that they are strapless and fabulous.  Often found on halter-neck dresses, these rhinestone brooches were always in the same place — right on the bodice.  Floor-length gowns are certainly not a requirement at prom, and in 2008 mini dresses had a moment in the spotlight. Props if they featured tulle overlay.  Your 2009 prom was all about taking a trip on the wild side, because anything animal print – whether it was zebra, cheetah, or leopard, as seen here – could be found on a prom dress.  This trend was for all the girls who wanted that classic princess moment. After all, nothing says, "I'm fancy!" like a tiered gown.  An unexpected departure from the traditional rhinestones, bold colors, and prints, neutral colors were a way to look so chic at prom — from the dress down to the peep-toe heels.  If you loved florals but didn't want to wear a flower print, odds are you opted for this style instead.  Side cut-outs had a moment this year, and they showed up on every prom dress – this orange gown twinning moment is basically proof.  High-low hemlines really swept prom season in 2014. These dresses provided the perfect silhouette if you wanted to show off some leg (and your shoes!) but also wanted to wear a full-length gown.  If a sh*t-ton of rhinestones weren't your thing, in 2015 the prom dress trend was more about using rhinestones as a subtle detail. They were found primarily along the bodice as a sparkly, but not too overwhelming, accent.  Forget a dress! This was the year of wearing a two-piece prom look, like these embellished (and gorgeous!) matching  top and skirt sets.  Dresses with leg slits popped up at proms in 2017, because let's face it: They make dancing SO much easier.

			 You'll get *so* many compliments. Remember last year around this time, everyone on Instagram and all your friends were snatching up those half-cylinder bamboo totes by Cult Gaia?  They looked cool in pictures and they had major vacation vibes because of their wooden tones and bright hues. If you're looking for 2019's equivalent of that spring break purse, you're in luck, because I've found it for you. It's the Angelou bag, made by the same brand. This year's getaway staple is a crochet design with a fun tassel detail and bracelet bangle handles. I purchased it on sale on Black Friday this past November and recently wore it on my honeymoon. It got. All. The. Compliments. ("Whoa, that's so unique!!" "Where did you FIND that?!" "OMG, I LOVE YOUR BAG!" etc., etc.)  Now that it has been thoroughly tested in the wild, I thought I'd pass the pure joy that is this bag on to you. The Angelou comes in a variety of styles. I got the mini version in black (with fun gunmetal hardware), which basically held my phone (an iPhone 8 Plus), some cards, and a lipstick tube. But, Cult Gaia also has medium and large versions which can hold more than that.  They also come in a multitude of fun, bright colors. In case you're worried that the macrame construction of the bag means you may loose important things through the cracks, I can say that that never happened to me. All the stuff I put in mine was still there at the end of the night. That's because the inside has a mini, tightly-woven pouch.  There's one exception: I suppose if you carry loose lip-liner or eye-liner around in your purse, it *could* poke through the sides. So, maybe just refrain from doing that with this one? If you're not feeling the crochet, here are some more eye-catching Cult Gaia finds you might wanna try instead.

			 Make it STOP.  Recently, Crocs caused quite a stir when it debuted a high-heeled version of its humble closed-toed slides. But, just in case you wanted a slightly fancier, designer version (because why the hell not?), Balenciaga has you covered. On Tuesday, the brand took the sensible, waterproof shoe to another level when it posted this photo on Instagram: Yep, those are, in fact, Croc-inspired stilettos. They also look like a pair of shoes Barbie might wear, perhaps because of their pink coloring and rubbery-looking texture.  This isn't the first photo the brand has released of the heels, though. On June 29, a picture of  a model wearing the footwear appeared on the fashion house's feed.    As of now, there's no more information on the pumps other than the fact that they exist and it's unclear if this is a collaboration with Crocs or just a design inspired by the rubbery footwear.  One thing we do know is that Balenciaga has taken Crocs to new heights before. In October 2017, the two brands collaborated on a pair of platform Crocs, which then promptly and inexplicably sold out before they were even released in stores.  Those babies cost $850, so you can get an idea of how much these new stilettos might be. But hey! You can also use it as a phone!  Just kidding LOL. They're only shoes, people!

			 And they’re *bedazzled*. Wedding planning is stressful. From finding the perfect dress to figuring out the best seating chart that won’t end in a dramatic fight, the bride-to-be has a lot to deal with before her special day. Plus, all of that in heels? Blister city. What if I told you that you could wear a shoe that’s technically for weddings and also extremely comfortable? I’m just as confused as you are, but it’s here: Crocs for a bride.  They match perfectly with a fairy-tale wedding or a series of interesting choices. Honestly, at $100, they are pretty affordable in the scheme of wedding items, where a fork and knife can run you roughly $800. And they seem to be a hit: 110% wearing wedding @Crocs during my reception and NO ONE can stop me sorry future husband pic.twitter.com/rmbYD9hU9w So, who knows! Maybe this will be the next big wedding trend. At the very least, maybe the DJ can wear them, because it’s hard to play Bruno Mars for three hours while standing.

			 Talk about a fairytale day! These royals (and commoners-turned-royals!) had some of the most lavish nuptials, but it was their dresses that truly stole the show. Whether you need inspo or just love ogling at incredible gowns, click through to see some of the best royal wedding dresses in history.  The granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England wed the Duke of Fife (also known as Alexander Duff) in 1889 wearing an intricate lace and satin gown with embroidery and a high collar. She also wore a wreath of orange blossoms.  Then-princess Elizabeth wed Prince Philip in 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Norman Hartnell designed her wedding dress, which featured long sleeves and a stunning veil.  Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiary was an actress who became an Iranian queen — she married Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1951 in Tehran's Marble Palace. Her custom Christian Dior gown was made from more than 65 feet of white silk with with gold embroidery, and it weighed around 66 pounds.  The American actress wore a dress gifted to her by MGM Studios and designed by costume designer Helen Rose. She wed Rainier III, Prince of Monaco in 1956.  The younger sister of Queen Elizabeth, Princess Margaret wed Antony Armstrong-Jones in May 1960 wearing a Norman Hartnell-designed gown made from silk organza. The ceremony was also the first royal wedding to be televised and had an estimated 300 million viewers tune in.  Then-princess Anne-Marie married the future King Constantine II of Greece in 1964. She wore a sheer-sleeve cape over her gown and topped her wedding look with blue fine jewels.  Sonja Haraldsen, the daughter of a merchant, married the future King Harald V of Norway in 1968. His father originally was against the marriage because she was a commoner, but the King and Queen still rule Norway today. She wore a simple empire-waist gown with pearl embellishments on the sleeves and collar.  Queen Noor, who was born in Washington D.C. as Lisa Halaby, and King Hussein of Jordan married in 1978 after meeting the previous year. She wore a modest yet elegant Christian Dior gown for the occasion.  Princess Caroline of Monaco married Philippe Junot in 1978 and divorced just two years later, but her bohemian wedding dress, designed by Marc Bohan, was even more ethereal with the extra white flowers in her hair. The gown also featured bell sleeves and a skirt with lace flowers.  On July 29th, 1981, the world watched the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles when it was broadcast on television to millions of viewers. A husband-and-wife design team, David and Elizabeth Emanuel, created the grand dress, which featured 10,000 pearls and a 25-foot-long train.  The Japanese princess wore a dress with large buttons, a ruffle neckline, white gloves, a matching handbag, and a sparkling choker necklace and tiara. She wed Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan at Tokyo's Imperial Palace in 1993.  Rania married Prince Abdullah of Jordan in 1993 wearing a gown designed by Bruce Oldfield — the couple later became king and queen. Her dress featured gold embroidery, short sleeves, and a prominent collar.  A Grecian princess, Marie-Chantal married Prince Pavlos in 1995 at a cathedral in London. She walked out of the venue with her father (pictured here) in a sheer Valentino gown with mesh and floral applique detailing.  The Danish royal couple tied the knot in Copenhagen in 2004. She wore a duchess satin wedding dress by designer Uffe Frank, which had a scoop neckline and a figure-hugging bodice.  Born Dayangku Sarah binti Pengiran Salleh, she married Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah in 2004. She wore a stunning royal blue dress in the region's traditional Jong Sarat pattern woven with gold thread.  A former journalist and news anchor, Letizia married the future King Felipe VI in 2004 in Madrid, Spain. The Spanish royal wore a wedding dress by Manuel Pertegaz that had a dramatic high collar, a 14-foot train, and a delicate lace veil.  Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, married Prince Charles in a pale-blue chiffon dress and gold-embroidered overcoat, accessorizing with an eye-catching feathered headpiece. The pair wed in 2005 at Windsor Guildhall.  The Swedish princess wed Daniel Westling (her former personal trainer) in Stockholm in 2010 and opted for an off-the-shoulder design by Pär Engsheden. But the real showstopper was, arguably, that golden cameo tiara.  A former event planner and consultant for Diane von Furstenberg, Tatiana wed Prince Nikolaos of Greece in 2010. She picked a design by Angel Sanchez, who is from her birth country of Venezuela, and it featured a fitted bodice, lace bolero, and floor-length veil.  Kate Middleton's Alexander McQueen dress might be the most well-known wedding dress in recent history. The stunning design, which the now-Duchess of Cambridge wore when she walked down the aisle in 2011, had traditional but modern lace sleeves and a 9-foot long train. The queen generously provided the tiara, and her diamond earrings were a gift from her parents. Jetsun became a queen at age 21 when she married the King of Bhutan in 2011. She wore a traditional, vibrant silk garment with a yellow tasseled shawl and beaded necklaces.  Charlene Wittstock, a former South African Olympic swimmer, wed Prince Albert II of Monaco wearing an Armani Privé off-the-shoulder column. She met the prince in 2000, and the couple married 11 years later.  The princess of Brunei married Pengiran Haji Muhammad Ruzaini in 2012 in an opulent palace ceremony. Her wedding dress was similar in silhouette and detail to the traditional Brunei gown she wore to her wedding banquet, seen here.  Born Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy, she became Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg when she married Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume in 2012. She wore a custom Elie Saab creation with sheer lace and a long veil, which trailed behind her as she walked toward the ceremony with her father, pictured here. The Swedish princess wore a lace, cap-sleeve Valentino gown at her  2013 wedding to British financier Christopher O'Neill. Her long veil was super sheer, and her dress hem featured a lacy trim.  The royal wore a chic Elie Saab creation to wed Prince Felix in 2013. The delicate lace gown had a sheer neckline and long sleeves, and she topped it with a floral diamond tiara. Prince Amedeo of Belgium wed his Italian fiancée in 2014 in Rome. She wore a swiss dot gown with an illusion neckline designed by Valentino and accessorized with a diamond tiara.  In 2014, Beatrice wed the youngest son of Princess Caroline of Monaco (also Grace Kelly's grandson), Pierre Casiraghi, in Monte Carlo. She wore five dresses for the civil and religious ceremonies that took place — including this Armani Privé tulle gown she wore to the reception and completed with a diamond choker and a braided bun.  The bride, born Sofia Hellqvist, married  Prince Carl Philip in 2015 and wore an organza gown with lace trim. The former reality-show star turned Swedish princess chose to put her hair up in a chic chignon, with her floor-length veil pinned into the bun.  The stunning bride married Prince Christian of Hanover in a wedding ceremony held in her native Peru. Designer Jorge Vázquez created her high-neck gown, and a wedding party member carried her long train as she walked to the ceremony with her father (pictured here) in March 2018.

			 The Fug Girls reveal their favorite looks from fashion’s biggest night. This year’s Met Gala theme, “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” was originally greeted with trepidation. Everyone wondered just how hard the A-listers would lean in to the mood or whether the target would prove too hard to hit. But we needn’t have worried. Sure, interpretations of each outfit’s relative campiness will vary widely, but this pink carpet yielded something even better than a perfect record of accuracy: a sense of mischief, experimentation, and, most important, real joy. It was hard to pick only 19 standout looks from the buffet of fun, but we did our best to give you a primer. 
  That pun was too hard to resist. Janelle’s dress is an absolute visual feast, from the Mad Hatter’s menagerie on her head to the Picasso-esque skirt and peepers on her head and boob—the latter of which actually blinked its feathered lashes. If you want to see a master at work, watch Janelle wear this.   We can’t tell if this is technically campy or just prop comedy, but who cares? Tracee seemed to have a ball arranging herself in different dramatic poses inside this askew frame that echoes the gilded ones hanging inside the Met itself, and she also looks amazing in it. And on a night when Anna Wintour reportedly bans selfies, it’s almost subversive that Tracee turned herself into one.  This would’ve been aces at the actual superhero-themed gala from years ago, but for a night honoring camp, it almost doesn’t go far enough in evoking Wonder Woman. We wonder if she and Prabal, after getting a look at the crowd, wished for a do-over to really embrace the theme instead of just patting it lightly. In fairness, she may have been the only Barbie, although Nicki Minaj had echoes of the pink princess in her outfit too. But this is a pitch-perfect echo, from the expression on her face, to the hair and makeup, to the shape of the tiny sunglasses, to the hair-dryer purse. It’s no surprise that Jeremy Scott would nail the details here, as camp has been his territory for so long that he practically, well, camps out there.  Tessa showed up—in an otherwise unremarkable Chanel—with a pony that had been wrapped in latex and turned into an actual functional whip. It’s incredible and fun and mischievous, like a dominatrix Bo Peep. Leave it to Gaga to show up in a Russian nesting doll of a dress—four looks in one, each layered under the other, requiring a village (including designer Brandon Maxwell) to help her unveil each style. We knew Gaga wasn’t going to phone it in, but we didn’t anticipate that she would literally take out a toy phone on the red carpet as part of her routine. The red carpet is often a performance for Gaga and never more so than here. She was in her element.    Billy watched Lady Gaga come in with six men holding her train, presumably said “hold my champagne,” and climbed onto his golden litter. This spectacularly memorable experience—calling it “a look” undersells it—was apparently inspired by Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra, the Egyptian Sun God, and Cher, but people are going to be referencing him for years to come.   Just a world of thanks to Katy for making this so uncomplicated for those of us who like to riff on celebrities. When she arrived in this literally electrified human chandelier getup, Twitter responded in kind: If you weren’t making a Lumière joke, you were making a pun about her look being “lit,” and honestly, in these dark times, this was very relaxing. Thanks for serving up that softball, Katy—you’re a peach. Apparently, Mugler himself came out of retirement to design this for Kim and, look, the man knows what he’s doing. As intended, she does photograph as if she’s soaking wet, just as she is on the current cover of Vogue. From both a technical standpoint and that of corporate synergy—Kim’s real strength—it’s impressive.    Someone forgot to give Gigi a giant pair of ridiculous sunglasses, but other than that, this is pretty perfect. Sir Elton is probably proud—and maybe a little jealous. That coat is amazing. You know he’s calling Michael Kors to see if he can get one for himself.    Cardi could barely walk up the stairs in this gown—it was like she was draped in a weighted blanket, and she definitely almost fell over at least once—but who cares about personal mobility when you’re busy looking like a glamorous cartoon villain, destined to be a favorite of dramatic little kids everywhere?  This is joyous, fun, and making us hungry. She looks like a human salute to hard candy.   We’ve never seen Elle have this much fun on the red carpet. Maybe she needs to lean into a candy-coated ’70s salute to charm bracelets more often. We’re not sure how she’s going to manage everyday life with a dangly charm attached to each fingernail, but this night was not one to fuss about practicalities.   Can we all just take a moment and applaud Michael Urie—whom you probably remember from Ugly Betty—for freaking going for it? This is some Victor/Victoria realness (look it up, youngsters!) and it’s major.   Speaking of major, this look on Lupita is bright and brilliant and beautiful—rather like the lady herself. It’s only right that the queen of Las Vegas, thanks to her mega-successful residencies (and her actual residency) there, would come as an homage to what Sin City does best. And yet...is it too late to add some scenes to Game of Thrones? Because please, just close your eyes and imagine this version of Céline Dion vs. Cersei vs. Dany for the Iron Throne. We know for whom we’d bend the knee. Miller, who designed this in conjunction with Riccardo Tisci, described it to Garage as having dark connotations: “The celebration of camp is almost funereal....It’s almost like it dies as it walks in the room. But I think it consumes the other as well. You know? I think it’s like fire and oxygen.” Do we get it? No. Do we care? No. This is spooky genius, and we applaud that he went all in for his first-ever Met Gala. The only concern: How can he possibly top this? The story of Zendaya’s light-up Cinderella gown is one of her own transformation, and as such, it was surprisingly moving. She was accompanied by stylist Law Roach playing the fairy godmother, who—in life as in art—transformed her from a Disney Channel star into a grown-up, here with help from a dry-ice wand (and his own superb styling mojo). She even lost a “glass” slipper on the pink carpet as she walked up the stairs. You could argue that this look might be slightly more on theme for Heidi Klum’s annual Halloween party, but hey, the gala is at the Met’s Costume Institute, so we’re calling it a win anyway. Lizzo rocketed to fame, and to her first Met Gala, in a year when the theme was perfect for her aesthetic. We could jut as easily see her rocking this onstage as up the Met stairs. It was smart of Marc to bring her—and frankly, amazing for her to navigate this spotlight in something that makes her look like the powerhouse diva she is.

			 The Fug Girls look at who won Hollywood's biggest night. We've spent the last two months essentially hanging out with Lady Gaga, Regina King, Olivia Colman, and Glenn Close, and finally we're at the end of the road: Once the 2019 Oscars are over, all of these actors (and more) can finally take a long, relaxing seat after what feels like eons of promoting their performances. Which of them marked this with personal style bests, and which of them limped to the finish line? We've got the answers, from the fancy pants and shimmering capes to the plethora of pink.  God bless Billy, who has spent this entire awards season looking profoundly glamorous. He saved the best for last, in the form of this tuxedo ballgown—a phrase we've never typed before—and something only he could pull off. Real talk: This dress is a hot pink duvet of a gown. A very fancy bed-in-a-bag. And yet...she looks great in it, somehow seeming casual and easy in what must be 2,000 yards of fabric. We have no idea how she's managing this, but perhaps she's interested in teaching a class? Call it formal disco suiting, if you want to, because that's what it is—but mostly, we just call it good. We’d been saying to each other, repeatedly, that Linda’s outfits felt boring during her lengthy stint promoting Green Book. But now we are snacking on a heaping helping of those thoughts. Linda went very big and dramatic at her awards-season swan song, and while her pendulum might’ve swung a tad too far in the other direction—that dress is nearly overshadowing her—we are grateful it moved at all. Sarah obviously can carry any dress on her own terms, but tell us this doesn’t look exactly like something stylist Karla Welch would have pulled for fellow client Tracee Ellis Ross, who never met a gigantic pink gown she didn’t love. Now we want to do a deep dive on outfits they’ve each worn that the other might covet. Can we get Ocean’s 9 going with Tracee on board, so they can hit the carpets together more often?  There was a whole lot of pink on this carpet, in many sizes and flavors, but we absolutely love the authority with which (relative) newcomer KiKi Layne—who starred in If Beale Street Could Talk—cruised onto the red carpet in this lovely number. It’s sleek, cool, and unusual, and makes that pale baby-pink look very grown-up indeed.  Despite our initial unease at Emma's Vuitton partnership, it does appear that the house is trying to craft some original, unusual pieces for her. Yes, OK, she looks vaguely like a magical Hogwarts creature—her shoulders are a House Elf's ears, right?—but somehow that isn’t a turnoff for us, thanks to this dress's appealing texture and unexpected bronze color, and the wisely simple styling around it. But we suspect this one will get some heavy debate at Ye Olde Water Cooler. Usually sky-high, thigh-high slits like that make us clutch our phantom pearls like the uptight old crones that we are, but Regina works that thing beautifully—and all the way to Oscar gold. She makes it look graceful and glorious, rather than like an escape route for her left leg. It’s diplomatic to say that historically we haven’t had the most faith in Ashley’s sartorial taste, so this achingly sleek, crisply-cut sheath elicited happy gasps of surprise indeed. From the hair to the jewels to the asymmetrical neckline, it's absolutely perfect on her. That pale green is a hard color to pull off, but Yalitza looks amazing in it. This dress hails from a design house not typified by its restraint, so bravo to Rodarte for giving this newcomer and first-time nominee not just an unforgettable gown, but an unmissable one. Firstly, we love that Elsie's team put her in suits the entire awards season, befitting both her age and the sense of whimsy that being 14 years old so easily allows. And Amy looks so cool in the grown-up version that we’ve decided we need these two in a project together immediately. Someone please get to work on a mother-daughter comedy. It’s rained a LOT in Los Angeles lately, but there was no precipitation in the forecast for Sunday, so we’re not sure why Rachel needed a couture rain poncho. Maybe every year, she ruins her gowns with tears during the In Memoriam tribute? You know, there are easier ways to give a dress sleeves. J. Lo may not appreciate people coming up to her to reapply their lipstick by looking at her torso all night, but that's what you get when you wear what is essentially a mirror. The good news for her is that she looks superb in said mirror, and so she'll be fielding compliments all night while people are staring at their own reflections.   Conventional wisdom says you don't dress like an Oscar unless you're sure it's coming home with you, but our rule of thumb is that you basically never can lose wearing a gold lamé cape. Like we weren't going to make that joke. (Having made it, though, she looks great. Maybe we should clean out our closets. What if the likes of this lurks inside?)   There's so much we're going to miss now that the Crazy Rich Asians press tour has well and truly concluded, but most of all—even more than Henry Golding's face—we are lamenting the upcoming break in seeing Michelle on red carpets looking perfect from top to toe. At least she's gone out on this perfect high. Well, her face looks great—she is still Charlize Theron, after all. Her jewelry is also fantastic! There's a lot to praise here, is what we're saying. But absolutely none of that applies to her dress, which is a dingy color, severe fit, and less than the rest of her deserves.   This is heavily reminiscent of another famous Oscar gown—namely, Vera Wang's mustard-yellow number that Michelle Williams wore in 2006, which even has its own Wikipedia page—but at least Constance is giving it her own great oomph. Going into awards season, some wondered if January and February would be a coronation for Lady Gaga, Serious Actress. It hasn’t turned out that way, though—and thus it’s hard NOT to see this as Gaga’s final farewell to A Star Is Born, before, we hope, ripping off her gloves and swatting someone with them. (Is there any OTHER reason to wear gloves?!) Having said that, this dress is a good mix of Classic Gaga with Gaga 2.0, and we applaud her for striking that balance as she transitions into whatever is next.

			 Don’t suppose you remember a little necklace called THE HEART OF THE OCEAN, do you?  The ’90s were known for a lot of fashion trends, but arguably, some of the decade’s most memorable pieces were accessories and jewelry. From oversize studs to scarves as chokers to a little necklace known as the Heart of the Ocean, let’s take a walk down memory lane, shall we? Glitzy bling was almost as big for your hair as square toes were for shoes in the ’90s. Here, the Dixie Chicks rock the style. Honestly, back in the ’90s, the bigger the flower detail, the better, as Drew Barrymore demonstrates with her huge floral bracelet. Wearing your scarf backward so it looked like some kind of caped choker was All. The. Rage. back when ’90s fashions ruled the red carpets. Here, Halle Berry pairs her lavender gown with such a style at a red-carpet event. Remember those Tiffany’s heart necklaces that fastened with a circle-and-bar thingy? Courteney Cox showed off a similar version of that style while on the Tonight Show With Jay Leno. Pretty much every girl in your middle school class rocked one of these almost as fiercely as Reese Witherspoon does here. Why wear a headband on *top* of your head when you can wear it *across* your forehead—a question many ladies, including Drew Barrymore, asked around this time. Gothic pieces had a huge renaissance during the ’90s, as Jen Aniston demonstrates right here. Accessorizing back in the day meant coordinating to a T, so if your earrings had a color, they’d better match your dress. Shout-out to the choker scarf here, too, on Elle MacPherson. Y’all don’t need me to tell you why this particular piece of jewelry was so popular back in the day. Instead, let’s all just bow down to the original jewel of our collective fashion hearts, Celine Dion. Got some necklaces? Layer ’em all on top of each other—the more sparkly, the better. Remember that time in the ’90s when everyone was basically dressing and styling their hair as if they were in a Jane Austen movie? These pearls were part of that craze, and Katie Holmes doing it makes me think this should happen again?! Lara Flynn Boyle showed off the very classic trend—made even flashier in the ’90s—of dramatic drop earrings on the red carpet. Have a formal event to go to in the ’90s? Better put on your flashiest rings. Julia Louis Dreyfus demonstrates. During this time, statement accessories were obviously all the rage, but in particular, people loved oversize studs—take a look at Christine Baranski showing off a pair here! Princess Diana wore these types of jewels all the time. “Punk lite” was a major deal during this time period, and nothing read edgier than safety-pin embellishments, seen here all over the Dixie Chicks, who wore it as belts, necklaces, and details on all their clothing.  Any and all chokers were hot in the ’90s, but lace chokers really went with that gothic resurgence vibe. Lots of stylists today would say that necklaces should only go on skin, but back in the ’90s, it was very popular to pair them with turtlenecks, as Jane Seymour shows us here. It wasn’t all about the drama—more subtle earrings also had a moment. Just take a peek at Julia Roberts in these cascading minimalist drop earrings. This type of pointed necklace had a major moment in the ’90s, and sapphires in particular were a popular stone, as Salma Hayek illustrates here. Look at the crystals on this spiral arm band! Nicole Kidman shows off this ’90s trend while attending a premiere with then-husband Tom Cruise. The more statement-making, the better, as far as belts were concerned back in the day. Here, Halle Berry rocks a silver chain one over an all-black ’fit. In the ’90s, nothing was more classic than a pair of diamond stud earrings, shown here on Natalie Portman. The same is still true today, of course. Leather cuffs were a big deal in the ’90s, particularly if they were embossed with some kind of Western design. Yep, animal print was just as popular then as it is now, perhaps even MORE so considering there were also chokers and bracelets made of the stuff. Not technically “jewelry” but couldn’t resist putting Lil’ Kim’s sparkly accessory in this gallery, so here you go! Subtle bracelets went well with minimalist styles favored by some celebs, like Keri Russell, in the ’90s. Somewhere between the oversize studs and the subtle drop earrings came the teardrop diamond earring trend. Christina Applegate wears them here. Remember when I said earlier that matching was huge in the ’90s, especially when it comes to jewelry? Well, matching jewelry sets that included studs and chokers were def part of that craze. Here, Calista Flockhart shows off one style. These very dramatic yet also somehow delicate styles were everywhere on the red carpet—see Lisa Kudrow killing it in one here. These have come back in style in recent years as well, but Melissa Rivers showed off the look back in the ’90s.

			 Whether you're going to a winery or hitting the local bars, these options have you covered.  Heading to your BFF's bach and have literally no idea what to wear? Look no further than these 15 party dresses that work for any situation, whether you're traveling to the beach or simply bar-hopping with the girls. Check out Cosmo's official bachelorette guide for more mind-blowing tips, tricks, and ideas. Wining and dining your way through the weekend? A midi-length floral dress with cutouts will complement your wine glass perfectly, and the light color will help you stand out against the greenery in all your photos.  Is the bride-to-be planning to go clubbing? Opt for a colorful, one-shoulder mini that'll brighten up any dance floor.  A pale pink mini is a great option for a bachelorette brunch with the gals; the length keeps it casual, while the bustier shape and ruffle detail make it flirty.  A linen halter-neck dress with stretch in the waist—and pockets!—is practical and comfortable for a local bar crawl, but it's still cute enough for all the pics you know you'll be taking.  There's nothing more classic than a bach in Sin City, so go all-out—hit the Vegas strip wearing a satin mini with a plunging neckline.  If the bride-to-be craves a more low-key party at the beach, pack a polka-dot midi dress with an open back—it also pairs perfectly with sandals and a straw tote bag.  Spice up your basic floral maxi by opting for one with ruching and a V-neckline. The print gives off major tropical vibes, and the high-low hemline keeps you cool in the heat.  If a you're attending a bachelorette party in New England, a pink strapless dress is perfect for the occasion—and there's no fabric more preppy than seersucker.  For a no-fuss, casual look that still looks put together, try an A-line, polka-dot dress with ruffle sleeves. It's easy to slip on and off for all those amazing massages you'll be getting. If you're heading to the charming city of Charleston, slip into a breezy maxi that you can wear either with sneakers (for daytime exploring) or with high-heel sandals (for a nice dinner out).  Fancy dinner soirées call for an elegant silk wrap dress, and this one with a tie at the waist does just the trick.  Light up the streets of Little Havana and Calle Ocho in a yellow mini with sequins—the low neckline and cutouts in the front and back will provide relief in the hot Miami weather.  An off-the-shoulder, powder-blue lace midi will make you look so sophisticated at those more upscale bashes—especially if the mother of the bride is in attendance. After lounging on a Bahamian beach all day, slip into a breezy dress with a deep V-neckline before heading to dinner with the girls. A two-piece number with a crop top and ruffled skirt is super versatile—you can wear each piece on its own, or together—so it's perfect for packing in your suitcase for a jaunt to Cabo.

			 She has six shelves for her purses. SIX.  Kendall Jenner posted a video to Instagram Stories on Sunday night of her mom's enviable and GIANT walk-in "boss closet," and, in short, it's freaking amazing. The space is complete, in true Kris Jenner fashion, with a piece of hard case luggage reading "MOMAGER."    The video clip is short, but there's a lot going on, so let me break it down for you. First, an impressive wall of handbags appears on the left – it's six shelves in total from floor to ceiling – and, in the corner, there's a leather chair. You know, in case you need to rest from the exhausting task of picking one out to go with your outfit.  The usual designer suspects are present: Hermès, Chloé, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, to name a few. Then, the camera continues across the room to yet another wall of purses, this one dedicated purely to Kris's multicolored collection of Birkin bags.  Kendall keeps panning to reveal a whole wall of hanging space filled with dress shirts, jackets, and tops, but the it seems the most prized items are the pieces of Goyard luggage stored in cubbies above the hanging racks, including the "MOMAGER" trunk ("Momager" was also the name of her Kylie Cosmetics collab in May). If you need me, I'll just be over here daydreaming about Kris's amazing closet the rest of the day.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 What’s under this cape actually blew my mind. The theme of this year’s Met Gala is “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” and let’s just say that Lady Gaga, one of the first celebs on the red carpet, has nailed it in a hot-pink cape by Brandon Maxwell that would take up my entire apartment. Gaga made an entrance with a bunch of men lifting up her train and holding black umbrellas over her. It was super casual. Then came the big reveal—underneath the cape was a huge black dress!  Omg that’s a real queen #MetGala https://t.co/mmHtZTqZI3  And underneath that dress...was another dress—again in hot pink! And underneath that look was a final bra-and-tights situation! Four looks in one!! RIP me and also Twitter, bc honestly no one could deal. Take a look: LADY GAGA DRESS#MetGala #MetGala2019 pic.twitter.com/Q1jbQclojp *@ladygaga arrives at the #MetGala* The World: pic.twitter.com/4P0ZvENwm9 gaga changing outfits on the met gala red carpet pic.twitter.com/5XuC5cNlwW LADY GAGA ALREADY WON TONIGHT WITH 4 OUTFITS IN 4 MINS #METGALA pic.twitter.com/hq30RADT6l LADY GAGA HAS OFFICIALLY WON MET GALA, EVERYONE ELSE CAN GO HOME NOW #MetGala pic.twitter.com/JArWMtgyzS Lady Gaga just out here throwing transformation after transformation like: #MetGala pic.twitter.com/AneCz6qQM5 Ok, Lady Gaga, that was something #MetGala pic.twitter.com/jnezjtUXfq me every time lady gaga busts out a new dress #MetGala pic.twitter.com/HmMSUovlRq Someone give @LadyGaga an award for her performance at the #MetGala. pic.twitter.com/OAoAdkKXWE In case you were wondering, Anna Wintour was delighted and so was everyone else there:  GUYS.

			 Racist, sexist, gross. Halloween is supposed to allow for irreverence and inappropriateness, but some costumes go too far. If an outfit you're planning to wear appropriates a culture, or is just straight up disgusting, maybe consider wearing a different one? Just a thought! This is a snake-charmer costume, which includes the reptile as a replacement for a penis. How creative. Just—why would you wear a single breast as a costume unless you mean to be gross with it all night? So unclear why this outfit, which appropriates Native-American culture, would still be available for sale nowadays. Can we stop it with the boob-shaming, please? This costume is just wrong on so many levels. Geishas are women who study art, dancing, and singing in Japan—they shouldn't be your Halloween costume. Voodoo is a spiritual religion practiced in many countries, including west and central Africa and the Caribbean. In the U.S. we associate it particularly with the African diaspora in New Orleans, so can we just not with this costume? Do we really have to go over this again? Putting a bunch of Latin-American stereotypes together isn't creative. Taking the traditional garments of a region or culture is uninspired. Promise you there are better ways to dress sexy this Halloween. Actually, go ahead and wear this one. It will help people know exactly what you are! The Romani are a group of nomadic people who have faced oppression and hardship due to their culture and lifestyle. Maybe sexualizing them with a costume that uses what many deem to be a pejorative term isn't the best? Tampons—they're hilarious and sooooo spooky! Not. The "Day of the Dead" is a widely-celebrated Mexican holiday honoring ancestors who have passed on. Does that sound like a good costume to you?

			 Check you out!!! Fall weddings are hard because the temps have cooled way down but you still want to look hot. Try out these great options, which all have some type of sleeve or some extra length to help you out in the cold department! How pretty is this black-and-tan printed off-the-shoulder dress with a sexy slit? Say yes to this past-the-knees floral number in a stunning dusty-rose color. Hello, baby blue! This sweet shift shows a lot of skin while still keeping you warm with that midi length and some voluminous sleeve action. If it’s a low-key wedding you’ll be attending, why not try out this more casual striped style? Go bold in a piece with some bright yet muted colors in a fun, abstract print. Everyone loves a knot-front design and this golden velvet piece is no exception. Just because it’s simple doesn’t mean it can’t be stunning. Take a cue from this bold orangey-yellow three-quarter-sleeve design. Wanna show off a little leg? Go for a mini with sleeves, like this pretty pink lace piece. Impress literally everyone in this silk gown with a pussy-bow detail at the neck and balloon sleeves. You will never have more fun dancing at a wedding than in this piece with a drastic fringe hem. Can’t go wrong with an LBD, and this one has funky see-through panels throughout. Wrap dresses are so much fun, and this half polka-dot, half solid lavender piece is no exception. Go ’90s in this spaghetti-strap design that comes in a bright-blue shade and a very wild pattern. One part silk slip, one part macrame-fringe freshness. Everyone will love your choice of frock at your next black-tie occasion if you go with this funky lewk. Nothing’s sexier than a little shoulder cutout and a thigh-high slit, amirite? High necks, long sleeves, can’t lose. Give a nod to the ’60s in this funky striped number with a tie-front waist. If you really want to take it to a mod place, style it with white boots. The flutter sleeve is the cape’s less dramatic sister, but this flutter design, with its pretty floral print and thigh-high slit, will definitely get you noticed. Going for Jane Austen vibes? Might I present this nude dress with regency-era sleeves and stylish bodice detailing? Blue and yellow is your favorite fall color combo—you just didn’t know it until you saw this dress. If you can’t quite quit summer, this fresh blue-and-white striped design will keep you covered while still paying tribute to the warmer days of your past. More stripes, this time in a neutral tone. What’s not to love? Doesn’t get better than gingham patterns and a bunch of tiers. Silky smooth and so distinct, this dress will make all the guests at the wedding wonder where you got it—and be even more flabbergasted when you tell ’em it was less than $80. Ain’t no shame in a navy balloon-sleeve piece with pretty eyelet details at the waist and a flirty low-V neckline.

			 We throw the term around all the time without going deep. Here’s how to put your money where your mouth is. You love shopping but you also love the environment—and yes, you can have both. Here, designer Mara Hoffman and Amour Vert CEO Aaron Hoey, who use nice-to-the-earth practices in their businesses, define all the words you need in your vocab. Your friends will be *so* impressed next time you go post-brunch shopping.   “Biode­gradable”  Silk, linen, wool, and hemp ­fabrics easily decompose into natural ­elements (as in, not landfill filler) after being trashed. 
 “Eco-friendly”  This stuff is made with minimal damage to the planet—aka without polluting all over the place. “Ethical” An umbrella term that essentially means the people who worked on an item were treated safely and paid fairly. Buying ­ethical means you’ll empower others—and get all the compliments. 
 According to Everlane's site, "each factory is given a compliance audit to evaluate factors like fair wages, reasonable hours, and environment."  "Patagonia engages in a range of due diligence activities to promote and sustain fair labor practices, safe working conditions and environmental responsibility," according to their website.  According to OV's website, the brand supports "places where employees are safe, paid fairly, given benefits, and work regulated hours."   Reformation requires its "suppliers to participate in independent, third-party social assessments to ensure fair, safe and healthy working conditions throughout our supply chain."  “Fair trade”  If your v cute retro denim minidress is fair trade, it was made by workers in an underdeveloped country who earn a fair living wage.   “Organic” You might buy strawberries with this label, and the same idea applies here. The cotton in the shoes below, for example, was grown without using any harsh chemicals.   “Recycled”  One of the three Rs you learned way back in the day. It means an item was created from materials (plastic, rubber, metal, fabrics, etc.) that have been reused. “Sustainable” Sort of like a combination of “eco-friendly” and “ethical.” Translation: The company that made your gorge floral-print skirt was nice to the environment and looked out for its workers. 
 
 “Upcycled”  Basically, when garbage (or, okay, stuff that has outlived its purpose) gets a glow-up. For example, the fibers in these supercute bikinis were made partly from fishing nets. 
 “Vegan”  When zero animal products (like leather, fur, or even silk) go into making something. These gorge python slingbacks, for instance? Not actually from an actual python. 
 Help out marine life—while looking like a flawless mermaid—with these ocean-friendly products.  This formula is reef-friendly and biodegradable so it doesn't harm the environment. Yay!  A gel cleanser formulated with organic seaweed so it hydrates and clarifies skin.  A purchase helps support the Sea Turtle Conservancy, a non-profit that preserves the critters.  This plant-based spray is made with sea kelp extracts and made with recyclable glass packaging. The brand is donating $250,000 toward cleaning America's beaches; this bottle is also made with 100 percent recycled plastic.

			 You’re welcome, TBH.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Please excuse this brief pause from your Instagram shopping and celebrity dog perusing (yes they can coexist)—well, actually, keep the shopping and press pause on the dogs. Welcome back to our series Instagram vs. Reality! It’s your favorite show in which our fashion editor, Rachel Torgerson, puts Instagram Ads to the test, truly heroic and necessary work. Hence the reason you needed to keep shopping. Okay, cool.  We’ve already talked about the hot brand Reformation, and now, we’re putting the workout brand Fabletics to the test. The brand was cofounded by Kate Hudson and has been around since 2013. Its mission is to be affordable activewear...but it’s still semi pricey. Like Rachel says, the website is confusing. You can sign up for a flexible monthly membership program and become a ~VIP member~, which sounds so badass. Or if you don’t want to sign up to be a member because you hate commitment (me!), you can pay a little more and buy the pieces regardless. Ah, the life of non-VIPs.  So is it worth it? Should you become a VIP or is Fabletics just another activewear brand? Can you actually work out in its stuff or is it just cute? Is its site too confusing? Can I wear the teddy coat and not look like a potato? I have so many very important questions. SO MANY QUESTIONS.  Thank god Rachel has the answers, and spoiler, they’re pretty good. (Because she’s a queen.) Not only are the leggings she tries on stretchy and cute, BUT they also have a phone pocket, which is an absolute must. And the teddy coat is, like, a full win. But the tank...? Well, you’ll just have to watch the rest to see.

			 This is quite the outfit. As we all know, Calabasas, California, is nought but a town-sized photo shoot set for Kim Kardashian, and yesterday, she was spotted wearing five different Yeezy outfits out and about within its parameters. In one such ensemble, Kim literally looked like a snack: To clarify, she looked specifically like a Cheeto. Kim wore a head-to-toe orange getup, which included baggy cargo pants, rust-colored sock boots, two different sweatshirts, and futuristic, neon-rimmed shades. You could not miss her in this color if you tried. 
  That same day, Kim also modeled a skintight, blue crop top and leggings, which she paired with thigh-high slouchy boots in the same color family. It was very space-meets-athleisure. Here it is from the side, just because! And there you have it, folks. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Because if you're wearing something backless, plunging, or strapless, regular bras just won't cut it.  I, like most big-breasted women, choose not to go braless ever. It's a practical thing: I like to minimize bouncing whenever possible. Still, I dream about being able to frolic in a field of daisies, wearing a dainty, low-cut, thin-strapped, backless dress. So I went on a mission to find the perfect sticky bra for women with big-ish boobs, and *drumroll please* here's the results.

			 Ava Barash tells Cosmopolitan.com why she gave her savings to the Time's Up of fashion. Thirteen-year-old Ava Barash watched a news segment on a nonprofit organization with her mom back in February and was so moved, she decided she'd save up some money and even donate her bat mitzvah gifts to the group's cause. Barash is an aspiring fashion designer, and the org in question, the Humans of Fashion Foundation, aims to create a safe space for workers in the fashion industry to address workplace misconduct, like sexual harassment, abuse, and assault. It also provides pro-bono and subsidized counseling and legal work for victims. 
  This particular cause spoke to Barash, she says, because she's a designer herself — her bat mitzvah, held in March, was actually a fashion show featuring real teen models, makeup artists, and a front row. As someone who stays informed on current events and who eventually wants to work in the fashion industry, she felt compelled to help out.  "My mom and I have talked about #MeToo — she tells me what it's about and what's happening with people who are in bad situations with positions in their work," Barash says over breakfast in Manhattan with HOF's founders. "I feel sad that people have to go through things like this. But I'm also happy that people are speaking up and making themselves heard to create awareness so things like this don't happen as often anymore." In order to donate, she e-mailed the foundation, got their address, and sent a check for $500. "I sent them a letter, and some things from my fashion show too," she says, handing over the line-sheet from her show, which described 15 looks and had the foundation's website written on the back. "I was hoping by having that on the pamphlet that my friends and family would donate also, because this is just very important to me and to a lot of other people." The organization's co-founders, Antoniette Costa and Kristina Romanova, got emotional when they saw Barash's note. "I teared up, because it was hand-written!" Costa says. "Had it been $5 or $10, it wouldn't have mattered — to us, she was one of our first donors, so it meant a lot." For Romanova, the letter was inspiring for another reason. It arrived the same day Karl Lagerfeld made disparaging comments that appeared to diminish and belittle fashion's role in the #MeToo Movement. "[Ava's letter] was a beam of light," Romanova says. "That day, we read the Karl story and then got Ava's letter. To me, it was a sign that we still have hope in our society with these amazing young people, this younger generation." For her part, if she becomes a big-name fashion designer, Barash plans to use her platform for good. "I want to be very positive so that other people are very positive," she says. "I would want to make sure everybody's nice to each other any way that I could." Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Gimme all the throw pillows.  On Thursday, Rent the Runway announced its brand-new partnership with West Elm, marking the first time the company has expanded beyond the closet (i.e., clothes and accessories). Everyone's style evolves—even when it comes to their apartment!—so if you've ever wished you could swap your blankets, pillows, and bedding, this is Big. News.  
  The gist of this collab? Subscribers can choose from 26 exclusive "bundles" of decorative pillows, throws, shams, quilts, and coverlets that come in various prints, colors, and textures. If you have an "unlimited" or "update" RTR subscription, renting one of these West Elm bundles counts as one of your rotating spots.  "We really centered the launch of the partnership around the two areas of the home where [the user] spends the most time, which is her living room and her bedroom," says RTR COO Maureen Sullivan.  Members can keep their bundle for as long as they want, and they can simply return it like they would their RTR clothing whenever they want to switch things up. If you feel attached to a certain one and don't ever want to swap it out? Here's some good news: According to the press release, subscribers will have the opportunity to purchase it at a discount.  
  "What we see that drives our core business of subscription to fashion is this need for constant variety," says Sullivan, "and I think more and more people see their home as an expression of themselves and their personal style."   If you wholeheartedly agree, you can browse the below bundles to get your inner HGTV host excited until the products launch this summer.

			 They’re actually, dare I say it, trending?   It’s really happening guys...flip-flops are IN. No longer your run-of-the-mill post-pedicure footwear or shoes you wore in the dorm showers, this style was seen all over the spring 2019 runways. Below, 16 actually-stylish flip-flop brands to look into before summer’s in full swing.  Tkees is all about simple solid-colored styles and has a range of colors that go from this dark brown to a lighter neutral shade. The result? A barely-there design that almost blends into your skin tone.   While Rebecca Minkoff doesn’t exclusively focus on shoes, the brand does offer unique slides, like these pillowy ones for instance. If comfort is key, this cushiony pair is for you.  Tory Burch is known for its signature T logo and eclectic prints, as seen here with these chain-link-patterned wedge shoes. The brand’s flip-flops give off a nautical, summery vibe that are great for a day spent lounging at the beach or riding on a boat.  Havaianas, a Brazilian flip-flop brand, offers designs in an array of bright hues. Pick your fave color or stock up on multiple to complete your perfect summer outfit.   Reef’s styles definitely keep comfort in mind as many feature a cushiony sole and bouncy footbed that your feel will love. The brand captures that SoCal outdoor spirit, made especially for all kinds of beach activities.  Jack Rogers has been around since the ’60s, and Jackie O helped popularize the now-iconic whipstitch design synonymous with the brand. The designs capture that Americana vibe and come in SO many different colors.  Coach is known for its luxe leather designs, seen here with this sleek black pair. The elevated style would look amazing paired with a breezy summer dress at an alfresco dinner.  Ipanema’s Brazilian-made sandals channel the palm-tree-lined beaches of Rio—just take this vibrant printed design, for instance.  Melissa (aka the brand behind the jelly shoes of your childhood) has a plethora of ultra-feminine sandals, like this leopard-print pair with bow details. As a bonus: All materials used are cruelty-free and 100 percent recyclable.  Putting on a pair of Rainbows is like wearing a memory-foam mattress on your feet. The handmade shoes form to your specific foot shape with every wear, so they’ll feel like they were made just for you.  Old Navy’s sandals are inexpensive, but they don’t skimp on colorful prints and patterns. Case in point: this fun polka-dot pair.   Birkenstock has been around since 1774, and its comfort-first, thick-soled designs have slowly taken over the fashion world. The signature soft-cork sole and adjustable strap make these ideal for all-day wear.  Jeffrey Campbell’s shoes put a modern twist on traditional silhouettes, and it’s no different when it comes to the brand’s flip-flops. These suede shoes are definitely not for the beach, but thanks to their infinity knot detail, they’ll upgrade any street-style outfit.  Banana Republic’s flip-flops come in a basic silhouette but feature some not-so-basic scalloped straps.  Hari Mari uses recyclable rubber and foam to create all its shoes. In addition to the sustainable factor, its styles also provide major cushion to the bottoms of your feet because of their memory-foam-like feel. No painful breaking in needed, TVYM.  Charlotte Olympia is all about playful and feminine vibes thanks to the brand’s signature cat print. This style, which was created in collaboration with Havaianas, definitely stands out with its spots and metallic gold straps.

			 Channel the 😂 emoji.  Halloween is usually the time to break out your spookiest costume, but a scary one is definitely NOT required. Sometimes you just wanna go with something lighthearted that’ll make people immediately crack up when they see you. Those costumes are actually the best!!! Here, 35 funny Halloween costumes to make you (and everyone else) el-oh-el.  Katy Perry dressed like a literal snack with this orange dust-covered getup, including her very own Cheetos purse. Take a cue from her, throw on some matching shoes, and ta-da! Your costume will be a sure hit. Okay, so initially, this couples costume might not seem funny, but throw on a gray wig, hat, and bright overcoat, and it’s hard not to smile.  The Biebs’ fashion sense was, um, interesting circa 2018. From his tropical shirts to his bandannas though, it’s a downright hilarious costume to recreate—especially if you have the same shoulder-length hair, lol.  Damn, was this show a CLASSIC. This girl absolutely nailed it with the hand eyeballs, beige bodysuit, blue lipstick, and hairy pits.   The funniest costumes can also be the simplest. What’s not to love about an inflatable T. rex with tiny arms?   Like, literally with gray paint swatches and handcuffs.  See more DIY pun Halloween costumes. Cut some holes in a sweater’s hood and put your space buns through to channel Ilana—or your dog, I guess.   Because Phil and Lil’s mom was low-key the best character on the show. Rock the ’80s look with a sweatband, sweater, and sneaks.  The claw!!! For this group costume, DIY some bright-green beanies into alien heads, get matching gloves, and wear some blue spacesuits.  Bring the drama to any costume party with a faux-fur coat, knee-high socks, and, yes, earmuffs.  Cue the Tina twerk. You can make this funny group costume work with items you probs already have in your closet, like solid-color tees, shorts, and crew socks.  Just watch out for burning-hot doorknobs when you go trick-or-treating! The wigs, feathers, and generally disheveled appearance totally make the costume.  Practice your “blue steel” in the mirror, then you’ll be ready to take on the night. Space buns, corsets, headbands, and eye makeup are encouraged.  Don your best floral shirt, denim shorts, and straw hat on Halloween night.  A classic pun mash-up.  Hey, football head!!! The outfit colors and hairstyles are the keys to pulling off this group costume, and everyone will crack up when the whole crew pulls up to the Halloween party.  No one wears Yeezy like this crew. Go all out on the beige, neutrals, and faux fur for this hilarious idea.  All you need is fake blood, fake fins, fabric markers, and you can basically cue the theme from Jaws.  You can’t help but read the caption in his voice, right?! A white tee, facial hair, picture frame, and questionable hair make this Halloween costume.  A denim corset, pink bra, and overalls? That’s hot.  The most terrifying part of the movie, TBH. Buy the sweater online, wear a plaid skirt and sneakers, and throw your hair into pigtails for this one.  Name a more iconic duo. I’ll wait.  You’ll definitely start a trend with this look—or so I’ve been told. Don a purple bra and take some scissors to a white tank and you’re the queen bee, Regina.  If you love playing with animals at parties, this is the costume for you. You just need a pink tutu, hair gel, a button-down, and preferably a lil dog.  Hang on tight—this group costume is one wild ride!  LOL, get it?! Go all out with the eye makeup, then channel Parisian style with stripes, a beret, and a baguette.  Gettin’ punny! The animal ears are key here.  Throw a brightly colored blanket over yourself, attach giant eyeballs, and all of a sudden, you’ll be saying, “Yip yip yip yip!” Modest and sexy at the same time? Break out the neutral and pink paint colors and cardboard to create the pixels.  Birkenstocks, bohemian prints, and cardigans required for this couples costume.  Two of Kristen Wiig’s most hilarious characters make the best costumes.  It used to be so easy to hide an alien on a bike. Then Elliott ruined it for everybody. A red hoodie, basket, blanket, and fake E.T. make this instantly recognizable.  A bald cap is honestly the way to go for immediate laughs, and this costume is actually an important historical moment, people! Get yourself a vest, socks, and loafers and make your own cardboard kite, and this is a LOOK.  Take your love for Rihanna’s makeup line to the extreme with a Fenty Beauty Match Stix costume. The beige beanie replicating the foundation color? Brilliant.

			 Yes, queen! I mean princess! I mean duchess! The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, stepped out in a gorgeous sun/shirt dress to watch her husband, Prince Harry, play polo at the Audi Polo Cup in Berkshire, UK.   Check out Meghan looking smashing (so British!!) in her sleeveless shirt dress:   Meghan's "Ashland" sleeveless belted gingham eyelet dress is from  Shoshanna Gruss, hat by Madewell, and sandals by Sarah Flint. Jealous?! I am! I'm currently wearing my PJs and just spilled coffee all down the front. Jealous?! I bet you are! Also at the event? Serena Williams and Prince William, who also played in the game!  Last week, Meghan donned a more formal look for an event with Harry and the Queen. The newlyweds joined the Queen t0 celebrate the Queen's Young Leaders Awards in Buckingham Palace. Meghan wore a (light pink? lavender?) Prada short sleeve top and skirt set with double-breasted button down the front. She accessorized today's look with black Aquazzura pumps and a Prada clutch. Now please, a moment to celebrate the glory that is this photo:  Beauty! Style! Grace! What an iconic trio. (I originally had the word "thruple," but I think that's always sexual? Or is it not? Anyone? Bueller?) Correction: An earlier version of this story reported that, per SplashNews, Venus Williams and husband Nicholas Hammond also attended the event. That is incorrect, and Hammond is Williams' boyfriend.

			 From her cowboy boots all the way to her bleached blonde hair.  Taylor Swift first walked a red carpet in 2006 when she was just 16 years old. Just take a second to absorb that info. Now at 29 (she's turning the big 3-0 on Dec. 13), she's had quite the style transformation over the years. (She's also weathered public romances, celebrity feuds, that "I'mma let you finish" moment, and countless other controversies and life events.) From her country days wearing cowboy boots with minis to her sparkly pop queen looks, there's a LOT of fashion to unpack. Here are a whopping 150 photos to take you through (almost) all the outfits she's worn through the last decade.   A country star on the rise, Tay debuted her song "Tim McGraw" which reached the top 10 on Billboard's Hot Country. She wore a white dress with black western-style accents and cute heels to match. The curls! That Nashville charm! And most importantly, the cowboy boots!!! This was Taylor's first appearance at the ACMs—the following year she would win Top New Female Vocalist.  Hello, glam mermaid gown! This was a big change from her previous looks, but the iconic curls were here to stay. Taylor wore a long black evening gown with matching satin gloves and looked so elegant.  She wore a beautiful sea-green strapless gown with a flowing train at the 2007 CMT Music Awards. Taylor sported the best accessory of all here: the "Breakthrough Video of the Year" award. Taylor said bye to her classic curls and opted for a chic updo at the 2007 Academy of Country Music Awards. She wore a blush strapless gown with an embellished neckline. Here, Taylor performed at the first ever Academy Of Country Music New Artists' Show Party for a Cause. The waves and the cowboy boots are back! She wore a cute spaghetti strap turquoise dress with big dangly earrings and a stack of bracelets. Can we talk about the fact that her boots say her name? Iconic. Taylor wore a cream ball gown with pinned-back curls to the 2007 Country Music Awards, which gave off serious "You Belong With Me" vibes. That night, she took home the Horizon Award.  Taylor went for an edgier look at the 2007 American Music Awards. She wore a black embellished dress with her signature curls, a smoky eye, and, of course, some killer black cowboy boots. Taylor wore a purple Sandy Spika floor-length gown to the 2008 Grammys where she was nominated for Best New Artist. Taylor opted for a more casual look, posing after her appearance on MTV's TRL in Times Square. She wore a cute grey cable knit beanie, a long black parka, and some cowboy boots for flair. Taylor wore a classy burgundy dress with matching strappy heels to the 2008 CMT Music Awards. She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for "Our Song." Peep the thin double-headband on top of her signature curls.  Taylor wore a sequin embellished blush dress to the 2008 Stagecoach Country Music Festival. I'm obsessed with the matching sparkly guitar?! Taylor wore a stunning metallic gold Badgley Mischka gown to the 2008 Met Gala. She accessorized with dangly earrings and a gold clutch. Taylor wore a glam white floor-length gown with gold embellishments paired with silver earrings and a coordinating bracelet to the 2008 ACM Awards.  Taylor wore a super cute deep teal sequined dress at CMA Fest 2008.  Taylor wore a blush A-line style dress to the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. She accessorized with a big pendant, a silver cuff, and matching strappy heels.  Taylor wore this ensemble to her performance on The Late Show with David Letterman. She wore a black turtleneck (with the sleeves rolled up to show off her stacked bracelets), a scalloped-print skirt with black tulle, patterned fishnet tights, and black heeled boots. This look screams, "It's 2008!"   Tay donned a Kaufmanfranco glittery sequin gown with her hair in a sleek updo for the 2008 CMA Awards. Taylor wore a one-shoulder Collette Dinnigan metallic dress with silver Christian Louboutin heels. She won the Favorite Country Female Artist award, which coincidentally matched her ensemble perfectly. While walking around the streets of Manhattan, Tay was spotted in this ochre-colored peacoat with patterned tights and black heeled boots. Her curls were also a bit looser than they'd been in the past.  Taylor wore a black Collette Dinnigan dress with silver embellishments and a cutout at the neckline to the Clive Davis Grammys Party. Taylor wore this Kaufmanfranco black floor-length gown with a plunging neckline. She also won four awards that night, NBD. Tay sported a strapless bedazzled Kaufmanfranco dress with matching Christian Louboutin silver heels to the 2009 Brit Awards. She also traded her staple big dangly earrings for silver hoops and wore her curls up for the night. For the 17 Again Premiere in Sydney, Taylor wore a white Rachel Gilbert Amber dress with Fendi peep-toe heels. At the 2009 ACM Awards, Taylor wore a gorgeous red Angel Sanchez floor-length gown with a VBH metallic clutch. She also sported her now signature bright red lip.  #TBT to these sparkly headbands. Taylor wore a white V-neck dress with hers to the ACM Awards Artist of the Decade show. And just when you think she's moved on from cowboy boots, she brings 'em right back.  At the 2009 ACM Awards, Taylor wore a Mandalay black-and-white beaded fringe dress with black knee-high boots. Taylor was spotted in a pretty silver Collette Dinnigan dress with Prada heels at the 2009 CMT Music Awards. She accessorized with statement earrings and a silver Kwiat Cascade diamond bracelet. She won two awards that night and rapped with T-Pain on stage. 2009 was a simpler time.  Tay wore a sequined Kaufmanfranco floor-length gown with Lorraine Schwartz diamonds to the 2009 VMAs. Oh, and this was the infamous night of Kanye's "Imma let you finish..." interruption that started their feud.  Taylor looked like a literal princess when she wore this gorgeous Reem Acra gold floor-length strapless dress with her hair pinned up. She also took home five awards that night.

			 AND it has pockets!  The thing about having lots of sweaters is that they take up a lot of room in your drawers—and that’s extra true for the ones that are the coziest. Our solution? Get you a sweater that can do both, or in this case, can do it all—which is where today’s pick comes in.  This oversize turtleneck style, which is only $33, can be worn as a minidress with tights and a cute pair of boots. It can be paired with a trusty pair of blue jeans and sneakers. We also love the idea of matching it with a long knit skirt and sparkly heels for a holiday party. The possibilities are practically endless. As for what else you need to know:  The reception on Amazon has been pretty stellar across the board: 500+ reviewers have given it an average of 4 stars. Some call out the fact that the ribbing looks a little different IRL than in the photos. (Luckily, since this is a Prime-eligible product, if you’re not happy, there’s no consequence for sending it back.) Fashionable buyers have also posted plenty of pics, so if you’re looking for winter wardrobe inspiration, you’ve found a starting line!

			  These kids have better costumes than I do?! Love dressing up? Love candy? Love hangin’ out with friends and fam? Halloween has all three combined into ONE night, so there are tons of reasons it’s the best dang day. It’s also prime time for an epic group costume, especially with you and your kids. I mean, what toddler doesn’t want to dress up as their favorite characters or superheroes?! Also, let’s be honest, newborns don't really have a say in their costumes (sorry babies!), but they can still be part of an adorable family vibe. There is a ton of inspiration out there, whether you’re going for a pop culture reference (peep the Will Ferrell one below), a Disney movie, or just a classic devil costume. Here, 50 adorable, spooky, and fun family Halloween costume ideas that everyone can get in on this October.  The RANGE. This funnyman has been in tons of flicks so pick your fave three or take some inspiration from this family who chose Anchorman, Semi-Pro, and Zoolander for their hilarious getups.  Every circus needs a resident strong man, lion, and ring master! Craft your own barbell made out of foam, throw on a red blazer, and get your kiddo in a cute animal costume to complete the look.  Reach for the stars with this adorable family space traveler costume.  Join the "Tune Squad" with these matching Space Jam jerseys for the parents and the kids.  Get all dolled up in princess costumes that you can easily find online. Your little ones can pick their favorite one and will love that you are all matching!  Gang’s all here! And by gang I mean the alligator, Captain Hook, Mr. Smee, and Peter Pan, of course. This requires store-bought items and a little creativity with props, but it's well worth it for that group Halloween pic.   Yabba dabba doo!!! This is one costume straight outta the Stone Age.  “My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!” Get the whole family in on this iconic movie with white button-downs, black masks, swords, and wigs.  The cutest lil penguins you ever did see. You can cop the whole family’s outfits online or at a Halloween store.  You’ll have energy to trick or treat all night long with some Scooby snacks. It's easy for everyone to get in on this costume with clothes they most likely already own.  What a ferocious wolf you have! Grab your flannel shirts, a plaid skirt, and red cape to be this storybook trio.  Pop one leg up, dress in all pink, and you're done! Inflatable pool floats get the idea across, then go crazy with the color.  Smash that inflatable guitar!!! Don your edgiest leather and black pieces for this hard-core getup.  The trick to waving your wands? Swish and flick!  The coolest superhero fam out there, TBH.  Order these Pokémon onesies online and DIY a Pokéball dress to catch ’em all!  You’ll look so chic (and scary!) in this all-black group costume.  Don’t get stuck in a kitchen with those two dinos. Your kids will love running around in these inflatable costumes so much, they might not want to take them off.  Sometimes your dog is like your child! And this one just happens to look super cute as a floating house.  Make off with the family fortune! This costume, featuring matching striped shirts, black beanies and masks, and, of course, fake money bags, will *steal* the show.  Leather pants, bomber jackets, sunglasses, and big curls will give everyone chills when they see your fam’s costume.  Perf for families with a lotta feelings.  Dog lovers, this one’s for you. Nose makeup, dog ears, and spotted clothing are easy things to get for this oh-so-cute family costume.  Wakanda forever!  Pick your side. You can find these costumes pretty much anywhere, but it can also be a not-so-subtle way to embody the family dynamic. LOL.  Follow the yellow brick road! Or, in this case, Dad. Since there are so many characters in this iconic film, it’s great for larger families so that everyone has a costume.  Darla, Philip Sherman, Nemo, and Peach make the ultimate (and most adorable) group costume.  This is PERFECTION. If you’re a fan of anime and Studio Ghibli films, the whole family will have fun dressing as the characters from this movie.  And just look at the minion candy baskets!  If three’s a crowd, then six is definitely a party. Ditch the “karts” and be this Nintendo classic for Halloween.  This is one fam you don’t want to run into on Halloween. Gauze and toilet paper make this a super easy group costume.  Even cuter when you have twins! A wagon will help your kids when they’re feeling too tired to walk, and coordinating shirts group all the "Things" together.  Gang’s all here!  Say his name three times and this little guy appears. Get some face paint to make your kids look washed out and spooky like Beetlejuice and Lydia, and then the parents can go as Barbara and Adam (before they turn into monsters).  The Force is strong with this family. Nab these space costumes and some lightsabers online or at a Halloween store to defeat Darth Vader.  Because a crowded house full of kids is sometimes like a zoo. And parents sometimes feel like zookeepers.  Have you ever seen a cuter jar of honey?! Get everyone a pair of animal ears and some coordinating onesies to channel this classic tale.  Name a better trio. I’ll wait.  Even if the kids don’t have their licenses, these are cars they CAN drive. The family friendly game makes for a fun family costume, especially with the little cars hung like overalls.  Boo!!! No, literally. There she is! T-shirts go a long way with this costume—you just need a blue, pink, and green one.  The quirkiest but coolest team in all of outer space. This family costume requires a LOT of body paint for the parents, but the kids will be obsessed with these intergalactic getups.  Party on, Garth! Your little one will look so cute in a baseball cap and sneakers, then get dad in a blonde wig, glasses, and a flannel. Mom can put on a red tank and break out her guitar (or just an inflatable one).  The best part about this costume is that everyone can pick their fave color.  Who you gonna call? (Also, a baby carrier made to look like a ghost is absolutely genius!)   A tropical dress, seashell crown, red wig, and white beard make these mermaids recognizable. Even the family dog can get in on the costume!  Every family has a lot of personalities in the house, so this is basically the perfect costume. Everyone just needs a solid-colored T-shirt, iron-on letters, boots, and beanies, and they’ll be singing “Hi-ho!” To infinity and beyond!  It might be a little too creepy to be a kids movie, but hey, it sure makes a cool costume.  Fries, ketchup, a hamburger, and a hot dog go together amazingly. This is definitely for a family that loves ketchup—and everything that goes with it.  You’ll be singing the theme song (“In west Philadelphia born and raised…”) all night. Odds are that your kids might have similar pieces to wear for this costume so you don’t even need to shop for this one.

			 No, seriously. This is mandatory viewing.  After hanging out with puppies in his "Kiwi" video and carrying a hen into a fish and chips shop for a Gucci campaign, Harry Styles is back at it with another adorable animal photoshoot. He hit up Villa Lante, a 16th century garden just outside of Rome, for the Gucci Men's 'Cruise 2019' Tailoring campaign to pose with baby goats, piglets, and lambs. I mean..................... what else is there to say? Here you have Harry, looking fine in tailored Gucci (and those patterns, are you about to die?) while playing with friendly farm creatures — what more could you ask for? Nothing at all, because these pics are everything.  Here's Harry being kissed by a goat. Let's be honest, you wish you were that goat.  And here's Harry feeding an adorable piglet: Did you know Harry can rock a headband better than you can? Now you do!  We can all thank fashion god, Gucci's creative director Alessandro Michele, and photographer Glen Luchford for this glorious gift. The full Gucci campaign drops in November. But, in the meantime, more footage of Harry with various animals can be found here:    The famed song ‘Michelle’ plays as a soundtrack to the new #GucciTailoring campaign featuring @harrystyles in #AlessandroMichele’s latest sartorial designs.

			 It's the most stylish place on Earth! “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, the happiest show on Earth is about to begin!” a voice booms over the loudspeaker. A few hundred people hold up their phones in preparation as the lights dim, orchestral pop plays, and a parade of models stalk out onto the streets of Mickey’s Toon Town. A fashion show in Disneyland? Fresh of Fashion Month? Yep, this is Opening Ceremony’s Spring 18 collection, inspired by Mickey Mouse's 90th anniversary. When Opening Ceremony designers Carol Lim and Humberto Leon started out they were inspired by Mickey’s belief that dreams can come true, said the show notes. Apparently Leon even wore a Mickey tie and cummerbund to prom, and this collection is a nod to Mickey’s “Utopian spirit” and “1970s optimism.”  This love of Disney now manifests itself in clothes that are Mickey-printed but with a signature OC downtown twist. Oversized sweats, skinny mouse-covered track pants, baseball jackets and slim, satin motorcycle pants decorated with Disney character patches. Giant furry jackets and matching furry black bags printed with Mickey faces, and '90s platform sneakers teamed with Minnie print dresses — and so many more amazing looks: In the audience sat Laverne Cox, Chance the Rapper, Maya Rudolph (wearing her Mickey ears), Tallulah Willis, Chloe and Halle Bailey, Jamie Chung and other OC fans.  “I love that they give zero fucks and they make anything they want happen," Chung told ELLE.com. "They're like, ‘Let's do a fashion show at Disneyland!’ Done. It's unconventional and it's so unique.” Echoed Laverne Cox, “Whenever I'm wearing Opening Ceremony it always feels cool and, I hate the word ‘edgy’, but like it feels just forward. It feels very fashion-forward, it feels very street culture, but elevated.” As dancers and the official Disneyland marching band joined in mid-show, and the designers skipped hand-in hand with Mickey and Minnie by the end of it, it was clear that this was indeed the happiest show on Earth. A love letter to upbeat kitsch and childish good times. Fun and irreverent, yet still very fashion. SHOP Select items from Disney x OC on shopdisney.com, openingceremony.com and in Opening Ceremony stores now. Remaining ready-to-wear looks will hit stores in November.

			 Fifteen-inch laptop? That ain’t no problem! Luggage brand Away has a habit of keeping its multitudes of fans on their toes. Known for its sleek, highly functional suitcases and travel bags, Away has developed something of a reputation for cool limited-edition collections and colorful collaborations. Just last week, it launched a rainbow-cake-inspired collaboration with NYC bakery Flour Shop, and now it’s back at it again with something entirely new.  While it’s had backpacks and duffel-style day bags for quite some time, Away took its venture into everyday bags to the next level with two brand-new styles of tote bags today. Made from premium leather, these totes—aptly named the Longitude and the Latitude—are stylish enough to carry to the office and practical enough to become your go-to “personal item” on the plane.  The Latitude offers a wide, traditional tote shape that can hold up to a 15-inch laptop, while the Longitude provides a taller, more shoulder-bag-esque shape that can tote laptops up to 13 inches wide. Designed with on-the-go types in mind, the bags come with a special detachable strap that fits over the handles of Away’s signature suitcases for easy travel. Both styles come with a detachable interior zipper pouch and key clip strap and are available in four colors: classic black, forest green, a dusty pink, and a rich wine red.   Check out the full range below, then get yours at Away.

			 One of these is about to be your go-to shoe. From high- to low-tops, lace-ups to slip-ons, scroll on to shop the cutest white sneakers for the season. Just trying to get a run in with a breathable, new-looking design? Here you go. Lean in hard to the plastic trend with a pair of tennis shoes made of transparent PVC, which have white soles and laces. All about the "ugly" shoe trend? Try these bulky all-white kicks with subtle nods to the '80s and '90s. Not into tying bows? No prob. Slip these athleisure-style shoes on. People absolutely RAVE about Allbirds—especially how soft and comfy they are. The ultra light-weight shoe can also be worn without socks, which is a plus, IMO. This retro-looking bball sneaker is perfect for anyone who likes tons of support and an '80s feel. Another no-lace option that's easy to slip on and off. The Duchess of Sussex is known for wearing these go-with-everything kicks whenever she has a more low-key engagement. You definitely used to own some version of this shoe in childhood. Why not go back to basics with a pair that basically goes with anything and is *so* easy to take on and off. Minimal not really your thing? Go for a maximalist attempt at the white sneaker. This one has tons of appliques in the form of sweet-looking daisies and more edgy silver studs. This classic canvas high-top sneaker with subtle red and navy trim is just the thing to pair with cut-off shorts and a cute sweatshirt. Lots of white kicks have a pop of brighter color, like green, gold, or red. This pair has a few neutral tones mixed in, which add interest, but don't overwhelm, and also go with everything. These simple sneaks are pretty standard except for the way you tie 'em!  Were you looking for more of a sandal than a sneaker? Well, here you go! If you're the kind of person who constantly crushes the back of your kicks, these are definitely the shoe for you. A platform sneaker with a sweet silver detail will give you some elevation while keeping it casual. If your style is more timeless than trendy, consider a retro-inspired pair, with blue and red chevron details and a ribbed trim. With perforated leather and a pointed toe, a slip on shoe like this one will look more like a flat than a sneaker, which can help you stay comfy, even during work.

			 "You get a bag, and you get a bag, and you get a bag!"  If anyone knows how to give a gift, it's Oprah. Her 2018 List of Oprah's Favorite Things is our look inside what the queen of gift-giving may be putting underneath her tree (sadly, no cars this year!). Out of the 100+ items she selected for this year's list, the Harper Crossbody by K. Carroll Accessories caught our eye — and apparently everyone else's. Why? Because it's a serious steal. Unlike other handbags that prioritize fashion over function, this $20 crossbody keeps all of your essentials organized with built-in compartments for your smartphone, glasses, and credit cards. Plus, it comes with a magnetic closure for easy access and a clip so you can convert it into a belt bag (a.k.a. 2018's version of a fanny pack).  After Oprah (yes, the one and only!) included it in her 2018 list of Oprah's Favorite Things, it shot straight to #1 on Amazon — and people can't stop raving about about its functionality and sleek design. "It is a great little bag to just throw on and go!" wrote one reviewer. "This bag is great for errands and running around to my kids sporting events. I am looking forward to bringing it on my travels in the very near future as this would be great to be hands free when carrying other things around."  Several reviewers called it the "perfect-size crossbody."  At 4 1/2 inches wide by 7 1/4 inches tall, it still holds the necessities without looking bulky — even against the most petite frame. Another wrote how it's her go-to Christmas gift this year. "Super cute and at an amazing price! I bought four more for Christmas gifts for my college nieces," she said. Speaking of Christmas, the bag comes in a gorgeous plaid print that's begging to be worn at holiday parties. And if plaid isn't  your thing, the bag comes in 39 other colors and patterns, including florals, two-toned shades, and animal prints. That means you can find a style that matches everyone on your holiday list (or ya know, you can treat yourself to several styles at a reasonable price!).  Whether you have holiday parties, sporting events, or Black Friday shopping in your future, do yourself a favor and listen to Oprah. I know I am (*she says after adding the leopard print bag to her Amazon cart*).

			 Oh, it's also $1 million.  On Monday, Victoria's Secret unveiled the Fantasy Bra that will debut in the brand's fashion show, and, wow, is it GORGEOUS. Model Elsa Hosk was chosen as the lucky Angel who will wear the million-dollar bra on the catwalk.  According to a press release, it has over 2,100 jewels, took over 930 hours to make, and is more than 71 carats. That's a LOT of sparkle. The style is based on the Dream Angels bra and features a longline silhouette with underwire. (For comparison, Lais Ribeiro had the honor of wearing the Fantasy Bra last year, which was priced at a casual $2 million.) Other exciting news? Victoria's Secret customers will be able to purchase a similar bra made with Swarovski crystals for $250 on Thursday, Nov. 29th at select stores and online. So if you're ogling the stunning $1 million version, you can get almost the same one for WAY less.  Hosk, who is originally from Sweden, first walked the VSFS in 2011 and became a full-fledged Angel in 2015. You may also know her from kinda-sorta wing-slapping Ariana Grande during the show in 2014, but recovering beautifully and leaving us with a moment to cherish forever. Anyway, congrats, Elsa!!! Can't wait to see you and this flawless bra at the show!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Raise your hand if you've personally been victimized by cold weather.  If, like me, your extremities (especially your toes) start feeling numb the second there's the slightest chill in the air, then, wow, have you come to the right place. (Also, I'd love to have a convention to discuss our cold feet problems, but let's discuss later.) Sometimes it seems like no amount of knit socks or thick boots can make your icicle toes feel like blood's actually pumping through them.  Luckily for you, because I was so tired of having ice blocks below my ankles, I scoured the internet for the top-rated, warmest boots that'll get me—and you, too!—through even the worst freezing temperatures. Guys, we got this.            And if you're in the market for equally warm socks to wear with your new boots, check out the pairs below. Shop away—your feet will thank me later!!!

			 Maternity ~fashun~.   I'm probably preaching to the choir when I say, "It's hard to find cute outfits when you're pregnant!"  Because your growing bump is only getting bigger and bigger as time goes by, it seems like your maternity outfit options get more and more limited. (You can only wear leggings for so long, people!) But there are definitely stylish pieces out there that will look so good on you—and your baby-to-be—no matter what trimester you're in. Here, we've done the work for you with these 18 cute pregnancy outfits that will make you feel comfortable and très chic. The key is not only picking things that have stretch and give to them (obviously), but also finding versatile styles that you can wear before and after you give birth. From oversize sweaters to overalls to wrap dresses, keep scrolling for some maternity inspo that's *actually* fashionable.  A balloon-sleeve maternity sweater looks great with a pair of winter white jeans and a top-handle bag. The longer hem also covers your whole bump.  You might need a little extra room with your buttoned coats to accommodate your belly, and this trendy leopard-print maternity one will do just the trick. Pair it with a simple black sweater and pants to really make it stand out.  If you're in the early stages and just beginning to show, opt for a cute cropped cardigan; this polka-dot one will feel amazingly comfortable. Wear it with white jeans and slides for a stylish outfit.  If your office is more corporate, you might want some basic black work pants that have a seamless stretch panel that goes over the entire bump. Pair it with pumps and a loose blouse for an effortless look.  Embrace your bump with a fitted dress this season. This burgundy one is cute for the holidays, but it also has a useful secret panel for nursing after you give birth. Wear this style with sneakers or dress it up with booties.   Maternity denim can look cute and these raw-hemmed skinnies from 7 For All Mankind are proof. Wear 'em with a black scoop-neck top and coordinating mules for simple but stylish outfit.  Two words: Elastic. Waist. Try a pleated midi skirt with a black turtleneck and kitten heel boots for any upcoming festive occasions.  What is more comfy than a soft pair of joggers? These ones are perfect for a casual day out and look v cool with platform sneakers, a black zip-up, and printed T-shirt.   If you're out running errands or meeting up with friends, this crossover sweater is easy to throw on, but the asymmetrical hem makes it fun. Pair it with dark-wash jeans, black sneakers, and a sleek tote.  A T-shirt dress with ample stretch will make you feel so cozy, but the ruched sides on this give it extra interest. Pair this with a fab winter coat and boots to give it some flair.  Repeat after me: Trapeze silhouettes are your friends. Even if an item isn't specifically maternity, doesn't mean you can't wear it! This mock-neck velvet number isn't form-fitting, so it'll lay nicely over your growing bump.  A relaxed jumpsuit is another great pregnancy option. The fabric has give to it, and it’s an easy piece to style up or down.  A flowy silhouette like a babydoll top won't make you—or your bump—feel restricted. Pair this gray one with black pants and a felt hat if you're so inclined.  Overalls are basically a maternity must-have. They're effortless with a T-shirt or tank underneath, but you can also wear them with sweaters when it gets colder. These ones have an elastic side so they'll stretch with you.  Sure, the word "poncho" doesn't automatically conjure up the most stylish mental image, but have you seen a cable knit one? This cream-colored style is breezy and great for winter, and when paired with black cropped flares and loafers, you'll be killing the pregnancy fashion game.  A wrap dress is a piece that looks good on everyone, pregnant or not. The tie waist on this silhouette means it's super easy to adjust and let it out as you get later into your pregnancy.  This gorge dress can be worn as is when pregnant, but you can also belt it after you give birth and it'll look just as good. With knee-high tan boots and a cute headband, this'll become your fave ensemble.  Leather leggings are a great way to stay comfortable while also looking v trendy. Throw on a sweater and some metallic-accented sneaks, and your street style will be so on point.

			 We see you, girl.  Meghan Markle made her first public appearance in over a month yesterday, and the short tuxedo dress she wore was straight fire. Apparently, aside from being stunning, the look also broke one major royal fashion rule.  Per royal tradition, women are always supposed to wear pantyhose for public appearances. Royal expert Victoria Arbiter told Insider last year,"You never see a royal without their nude stockings. I would say that's really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires." BUT LOOK. Look at Meghan's legs! Not a stocking in sight. No pantyhose for this girl. Those legs are bare.  Technically, this isn't the first time Meghan's broken this rule. She didn't wear stockings in her engagement photos, but at that point she wasn't married to Prince Harry yet so it's probably a gray area on whether she had to wear them or not.  She's worn them in most of her formal post-wedding appearances, though. Like when she made her appearance with Queen Elizabeth.  And at Prince Charles's birthday celebration. But circling back to the outfit at hand, tights or no tights, the girl looks DAMN GOOD. Check out what other royal fashion rules the family has to follow here:  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 Everything you ever needed to know about keeping them fresh and clean (and not lost!). Getting engaged is a wonderful thing, and the ring you now have is most likely gorgeous, but it also probably cost a lot of money, meaning you want to protect it and keep it nice. Like, really nice, because at least if you're like me, it's the most expensive thing you now own. Enter Grant Mobley, gemologist and director of Pluczenik, one of the world's leading diamond companies, who can answer all the burning questions you now have about your stone and the band that came with it. Every few months, you can take your ring to a jewelry store to have it professionally cleaned with steam. According to Mobley, most independent jewelers will do this at no charge. Doing this often is important, because the cleaner will also inspect the setting to make sure none of your stones are loose. In between professional servicing, you can clean your ring with dish soap (like Dawn, but any brand will do) and a toothbrush to keep it sparkling. If you want, you can get an ultrasonic cleaner, but do not use it on stones that are more fragile than diamonds, like emeralds or opals. Mobley suggests the one below.  SHOP NOW Ultrasonic Jewelry Cleaner and DVD Cleaner, BROOKSTONE (Available at Amazon), $73 "As long as your ring is gold or platinum and diamonds, you can't really do anything to it with household products because it is very resilient," Mobley says.  "It doesn't hurt the ring but that oiliness is going to make [the diamond] very dull," Mobley says. "Your ring will require cleaning more often." Mobley suggests having a special and stable place to place your gem while you lotion up. "That's one of the easiest ways to lose your ring — taking it off at the sink and then forgetting you've done that."  "There's really no skin product that is going to be damaging enough to hurt the ring," Mobley says. "None of these household items are going to be in contact for long enough to make a difference, typically." Like lotion, makeup or other products could dull your ring, so if you never take it off, you'll have to clean it frequently to keep it shiny.  Chlorine won't affect a diamond, but if your ring is set in gold or platinum, keep it out of a swimming pool or hot tub. "The chlorine will make the gold porous — it reacts with it over time," Mobley says. "This can make the setting brittle and could break a prong. When I worked at a jewelry counter, I used to be able to tell if my customers owned a pool." As far as chemical reactions with your metal settings or stones, there's nothing to fear from salt water. Nevertheless, Mobley advises against wearing it in the ocean. "The water is colder, which makes our fingers shrink. The ring is way more likely to fall off in those circumstances," Mobley says. "Once it is off of you the chances of finding it are almost nothing."  You either could leave it behind, in a safe spot in your house or apartment, or use the hotel's safe. "I use hotel safes all the time — that's really the only option if you brought your ring on vacation," Mobley says. "I've never had any trouble — you've got to put your valuables somewhere, and it's definitely safer in the safe than in the ocean with you." For one, develop habits around your ring: For example, Mobley says, always store it in the same place when you take it off. He also recommends buying a jewelry box, if you don't already have one, for the same reason. But the best thing you can do, as far as precautions go, is buy insurance. "People lose stuff constantly," Mobley says. "Jewelry insurance is surprisingly inexpensive, so it's a no-brainer." In New York, it costs $250 per year to insure a $10,000 engagement ring, but it is cheaper elsewhere. NOPE. Home insurance or rental insurance never includes jewelry, Mobley says, though some companies do provide separate jewelry riders for an additional cost. "By far the most popular jewelry insurer, though, is Jewelers Mutual. They only do jewelry, and they know what they're doing." "Don't panic if that happens — it's really not a big deal," Mobley says. "It's part of regular wear and tear. Take it back to where you got it, and they'll usually replace it for no charge. At most, they'd ask for $50 to $70 to replace it, depending on how many were loose. But don't freak out — just know it will happen." Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

			 Look like a duchess for less.  The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, always looks polished and sleek. She's had so many killer fashion moments since becoming a royal, but what you need to know is that some of her favorite brands are on sale at Shopbop right NOW.    She recently wore black Castañer wedges with a patterned Figue dress to a Fijian market during her first-ever royal tour to Australia and Fiji. While the footwear label is already reasonably priced (about $130 for a pair of basic canvas espadrilles), styles similar to the pair she wore are majorly discounted on Shopbop.    She's such a fan of the shoes that she also wore them with her striped Martin Grant maxi dress while visiting Australia's Bondi Beach last week.  Meghan's also fond of Kayu, known for its straw bags and beachy aesthetic (perfect for a trip to Australia and Fiji, if you ask me!). She first wore a black straw clutch by the designer with a Club Monaco dress to a friend's wedding earlier this summer, and she recently wore the same bag ~again~ in Fiji on Tuesday.    Here's the thing: The same purse in the "natural" colorway is available for 50 percent off! (!!!!!!!)  
 You may already know that Meghan's sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, has a well-documented affinity for affordable Superga sneakers, but it seems Meghan herself is more drawn to reasonably-priced Veja shoes. She wore the retro "V" logo kicks while sailing with her husband across the Sydney harbor over the weekend.  This brand isn't *technically* on sale right now, but they only cost around $150—which, for a royal wardrobe, is practically a steal.  If Meghan's royal tour style has given you some much-needed wardrobe inspiration, freshen up your closet by shopping more items that are up to 70 percent off during Shopbop's sale.

			 WOW, wow, WOW. Urban Outfitters is having an additional 30 percent off sale through July 3. Shop the best already-discounted pieces at even better prices — there's really something for everyone. I know everyone's digging those half-circle bamboo bags, but this one is pretty too, and just as blogger-y. Just saying. A ribbed, button-down tank is perfect for literally any summer event, especially in this vibrant color. A cotton bodycon style like this one is obviously sexy, but it also gives off a classic, "Oh, what? This old thing?" vibe. A form-fitting black midi dress with track-pants snaps up the side is both laid back and super steamy. Enjoy. Ever try on an outfit and think, This is almost there, it just needs a little something. These earrings are those somethings. You're welcome. Wearing a chambray bra top (a.k.a., a chambra, which I am copyrighting right this instant) will make you feel like you're on a little getaway to Havana, Cuba, even when you're hitting up your regular brunch spot that is very far away from Cuba. Spoiler alert: You are a hat person. Everyone is a hat person and we all need to wear more hats. Try a straw beret like this one to see what I mean. Always adding layers to your outfit? You'll love the fact that this jacket is basically two-in-one. One side is yellow and floral-printed, while the other is a deep navy blue with an embroidered flower pattern on the back. Obviously you need some sturdier tanks, and since this one is denim, it's definitely going to last, even though it seems frilly and delicate. Looks can deceive. Lots of slides are super plastic-y or furry, which can be fun, but sometimes you just need a classic summer sandal. Enter a pair like these fringed mustard and white ones that are fun enough to make a statement, but neutral enough to go with anything. Denim feeling too plain? Consider a style with an embroidered pattern or ribbon sewn down the side. The fun detail will add the right amount of spice to an otherwise simple look. Gold jewelry is great and all, but sometimes you want to make a bit more of a statement without being so shiny. If that's you, think about buying a wooden set of earrings in a simple shape — since they're neutral, they'll go with literally anything, but because they're so unique, they'll still stand out. Ever look at your closet full of clothes and think, I have nothing to wear? Same. A smocked, off-the-shoulder shirt will cure you of that feeling. Denim cut-offs can be fabulous, but a pair of vintage-looking red shorts will really turn heads this summer. Maybe slides aren't your thing because, well, they slide a little too easily off your feet. A pair of chunky sling-backs will ensure that your warm-weather shoes will stay on and look cute. Give that over-sized tote a rest this year and opt instead for a colorful, drawstring backpack that can carry just as much, but leave you hands free. How cute is this embroidered lip bra, which has enough support to create some lift, but is comfy enough to wear all day long? If you're not a dress girl, that's fine, but you're missing out on one of the best things about hot weather — the fact that your outfit only needs to have one piece. Slide a midi-length satin number like this one over your head in the morning and literally walk out the door looking put-together and stylin' all day. This summer is all about the silky midi, and one in a trendy mustard shade with two different sides for two different looks is both fashionable and functional. Comfy and casual, an asymmetrical graphic T-shirt is a staple in any summer wardrobe. This squiggly bucket bag has your name all over it. Jean skirts will never go out of style, but this black one with distressed details is the perfect piece for that concert you're going to soon. Red platforms, coming in hot! A sexy pair of sky-high heels in a saturated color will spice up any outfit, taking you from day to night in no time. This pleated, metallic fabric feels fresh and unique compared to the rest of the styles in your closet and the midi style can go both formal and casual, depending on how you accessorize. Delicate and frilly, this knit top will add a soft touch to any outfit. A pair of loafer-like espadrilles are the perfect shoe for endlessly exploring a new city on vacation, or running errands back home. A jumpsuit like this one feels just as comfortable as your favorite pajamas, but with its sexy cutout and knot detail, you'll feel super sizzling. A tote with wooden beading details shaped like this one can carry all your essentials. A blush-colored snakeskin pair will work with any flowy outfit you wear for the summer. Consider a pair of jeans with navy designs sewn all the way down the sides. This one's distressed knee details give an edgy vibe to an otherwise preppy look. This flowy floral skirt will be the statement piece in any cool summer outfit. This pair of shorts has floral prints on the pockets and at the waist, while the rest of them are a solid denim fabric. Yeah, white sneakers are fine, but silver sneakers are even better, especially during the summer, when everything's just a bit flashier and more colorful.

			 🎶  She's got legs and she knows how to use them 🎶 Selena Gomez and her ~legs~ stepped out in Hollywood on Friday night, and they all looked amazing! The slit on her silky dress went all the way up, and I'm so inspired that I'm cutting slits into everything I own — dresses, skirts, pants, etc.  Also, the jacket is perfection. Check out the back: Selena recently completed a two-week program to treat anxiety and depression. A source said she wanted to “get away and focus on herself with no distractions,” adding that Selena “came back feeling very empowered” following the treatment. The treatment of the on-site program allegedly included therapy, healthy meals, Pilates, and mediation.

			 Winter is literally coming. Before you pour one out for paper-thin dresses, floaty fabrics, and cropped pants, know it is still possible to look cute in the fall and winter, even if you’re bundled up from head to toe. Your summer staples can instantly become  cold-weather appropriate when you put them together properly — it’s all about how you layer your look. Because, honestly, nothing'll make you excited to say goodbye to backyard BBQs and unicorn pool floats like amazing boots and fuzzy hats. Don’t Ditch Your Dresses 
  Low boots look best with a dress — the Out N About boot from Sorel is completely waterproof and made with vulcanized rubber (high tech!) to maintain traction in slippery conditions. A long jacket keeps you extra warm, and a hat and scarf can be added for the chilliest days. Tuck Like a Total Pro A long-sleeve bodysuit is your friend. It keeps your base perfectly tucked into the top of your pants, so your shirt isn’t bunching up constantly under your other layers. To keep your pants from slowly working their way out of mid-height boots, wrap the bottom of your pant legs into tall socks. They won’t budge!  When it comes to footwear, waterproof shoes don’t need to be bulky or uncool. Sorel's Joan of Arctic Wedge II is leather, has a heel, and generally so cute that you don’t need to change shoes when you get to the office. Top it off with a hat — even baseball caps can be warm in fabrics like corduroy. Play with Length Your formula: short, long, short, long. Start with your favorite pair of cropped pants (your first short layer), and pair them with winter boots you want to show off, like this sporty leather and suede pair from Sorel. The microfleece lining will keep your feet toasty as temps drop. For your first long layer, add a shirt dress and secure it just below your chest with a single button to add shape. Then, pop on a cropped jacket. For your final long layer, slip on a calf-length coat in a warm fabric, like wool. Now that you've got layering down, conquer the coming seasons like you did summer: flaw-less-ly.

			 See the evolution from the 1920s through 2019. The Miss America pageant has been around since the 1920s, and it’s been a staple of American culture ever since. The contest has gone through major changes recently—it’s now branded as a “competition” with “candidates,” and there’s no longer a swimsuit portion—but this year’s competition in Montville, Connecticut, still promises full-on glitz, gowns, and talent. To celebrate its 99th year, check out the evolution of the ever-glam evening dress. Watch the 2020 Miss America competition at 8 p.m. EST December 19 on ABC.  Margaret Gorman, Washington, D.C.

			 And she’s not even close to finished. Inside the “Pepto Palace” life of Kitten Kay Sera. She’s frustrated. Outfitted in head-to-toe pink—visor, hair, sweatshirt, shorts, running tights, and the satin ribbon on her Converse—she’s busy turning her (also pink) fanny pack this way and that, trying to conceal its black belt. “This strap is driving me nuts,” she murmurs. Then, a lightbulb: She blouses her sweatshirt over it. “There!” she says, winking. “Pink positivity.” It’s the kind of obsessiveness you’d expect from someone Ripley’s Believe It Or Not named the World’s Pinkest Person. Because Kitten Kay Sera isn’t just wearing pink for a photo shoot, or for the day, or on a whim. She’s a self-proclaimed “monochromatic,” someone who lives her life in nothing but her signature shade, and her commitment is complete: She’s going on 38 years of marriage to all things pink, from her wardrobe to her fridge to her pleather toilet seat. “I don’t ever venture from my color ever,” she says. “You couldn’t pay me a million dollars to do another color. That’s how devoted I am.” She’s not just tossing off the money thing, by the way. Being monochromatic isn’t some quirk Kitten indulges—her very singular eye for color is literally her full-time job, thanks to her robust social-media following and her willingness to entertain the world’s insatiable curiosity about her life. Kitten was recently featured in Netflix’s home-makeover show Amazing Interiors; she’s currently shooting an episode of a Yahoo series called Obsessed; and she has an upcoming project in London which she’s keeping close to the vest, although she did joke that “the Queen of Pink needs to meet the Queen of England.” Kitten calls her small, otherwise unremarkable one-bedroom West Hollywood apartment the Pink Pepto Palace—in part a nod to the national spot she’s shooting there for Pepto Bismol—and it’s as full-body pink as its occupant. “This place is going to be a landmark!” Kitten says, grinning. Within a week of moving there 18 years ago, she’d slathered the walls in pink—the cabinets soon followed, and she’s since carpeted, coated her electrical outlets and carbon monoxide detector, and special-ordered everything from a fridge to a tub in her signature shade. The small thing that stands out most amidst this sea: Even Kitten’s cleaning supplies are pink. Her countertops are currently cluttered with prop pink cakes and painted telephones from a recent music video in which she wears, among other things, a cotton-candy wig that she actually breaks off and eats on camera. She got it from a local restaurant that serves it on a mannequin head and had to rush it home and film before it melted. From that same shoot comes the most noteworthy item in her house: a giant pink coffin, plonked casually next to her kitchen alongside a faux tombstone. Pun-loving Kitten wanted to turn it into a “coffin table” but couldn’t make it work, so it’s waiting to journey to its final resting place: an 11-by-11 storage unit that’s basically her pink overflow zone. The only concessions Kitten makes to the idea of a non-pink world are her popcorn ceiling (left untouched at the request of her landlord) and her toilet paper. There are three pink rolls over the commode, but they sit untouched; they’re hard to find, she explains, so they have to last. These are from eBay: “It smells like grandma’s attic, but so what? It’s pink!”  All told, from the tinted TP to her brand-new pink treadmill and everything in between, Kitten reckons she’s spent millions of dollars to turn her pad into a pink paradise. “I don’t even do 50 shades of pink. I do a million shades of pink,” she says. “Pink is everything to me. Pink is compassion—it’s powerful, it’s punk, it’s soft, it’s flirty, it’s girly, it’s everything. It is all. I can’t say that about any other color.” Running Pink Inc. is beyond a full-time job, especially when you need a coffin or a major appliance to change color on short notice. So for the past 18 months, Meg Gill—who confesses she doesn’t even really like pink that much; her hair is purple—has stood by Kitten’s side as her assistant, helping source what can’t be sourced and pinkify what must be pinkified. She made over the coffin herself with a paint roller. “It’s used,” Gill says of the casket, delighting in the slack-jawed reaction to that statement. “New coffins are expensive. This one had been used 200 or 300 times for burials at sea.” She points to the base, which has a detachable panel. “It’s seen the world. I saged it out.” Suddenly from across the apartment, where she’s donning a dyed-pink satin suit, Kitten can be heard belting a verse of Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time.” She appears and gestures expansively at the seven or so pink cell-phone covers lined up on her coffee table. “Is this a lifestyle or what?” she says, beaming. For a person who calls herself “monochromatic,” Kitten is a colorful character. She is unfailingly warm. She’s peppy and cheerful even when missing an earring (it’s hard to find lost items in a space where everything is roughly the same color) and she all but bounces from room to room, giddy that she gets to so blatantly be who she is. It wasn’t always like this. A testament to her early days sits in the corner of her living room: a tall pink throne underneath a custom neon sign that reads, in a casual half-cursive, “Queen of Pink.” “It’s feast or famine in this city, and now I’m feast, thank God, but back then it was famine, and I saw that on Craigslist,” Kitten says, pointing to the chair. “I was totally broke at the time and I wrote the guy selling that and I said, ‘I’ll clean your house for a year.’ He was like, ‘Are you a good house-cleaner?’ and I said, ‘I’m the best.’ I was lying like a dog. But I went out and cleaned that house for three months to get it.”   She stops for a moment, overcome with tears. “I went from scrubbing those fucking floors to sitting in that throne,” she says. “Working hard and keeping your eye on the prize, that’s everything I try to do.” Kitten grew up in Texas in a family of artists and performers and dreamed of being a pop star. But she remembers the day in 1980 that pure pinkness popped into her life: On her birthday—she declines to say which, but The Sun put her at 53 earlier this year—the pink tennis shoes and sweatshirt she wore that day gave her a particular vibe.   “They weren’t anything special, and it wasn’t high fashion, but I just felt really good,” she recalls. “I felt like pink chose me. It just felt right, and I thought, ‘This is something I love. I love the way I feel.’” Over the course of the next year, she emptied her closet of anything that didn’t fit the bill—her four older sisters were her happy beneficiaries—and honed her resourcefulness by dyeing things like her white Doc Martens. “They liked it, but they thought I was going through a phase,” she says of her friends and family. “By the fifth year, they knew it was a lifestyle. I’m a pink passionista.” But even the pinkest passionista could only go so far in Texas, so at the turn of the millennium, Kitten sold her classic pink 1967 car to finance a move to Hollywood. Her original goal was to sing, but she quickly got snapped up for commercial and TV work due to her distinctive look. Eventually, she changed her name—Kitten is a childhood nickname; Kay Sera is a twist on “Que Sera Sera” in honor of one of her similarly chipper inspirations, Doris Day—and finally social media caught on to her. Kitten’s rise to fame in the 2010s happened to coincide with the explosion of millennial pink—not that she buys into the hype: “It’s not really pink, it’s almost tan,” she says. “Some of that new stuff is not pink to me—it’s a dusty beige.” By 2013, she was raking in endorsement deals for TV commercials and Instagram, where she has more than 81,000 followers, and by renting out her apartment for celebrity photo shoots. She finagled a customized pink Volkswagen for free in exchange for the sheer power of a pinkstagram social-media push. She’s also written a children’s book called Miss Kisses - The Pup Who Turned Pink based on her own dyed-to-match pooch (safely, she insists, via beet-based coloring), and she auditioned for America’s Got Talent in 2017. She’s even megastar-approved: When Kitten began recording music of her own a few years ago, she hired a fellow alumna from her performing-arts school in Houston to sing backup vocals. You might have heard of her. “I used to go in and mentor the girls, and I asked the choir teacher who her standout student was. She said it was Beyoncé,” Kitten recalls. “My friend was like, ‘She isn’t going to agree to it,’ and I said, ‘Wait and see.’ Tell me I can’t do something, and it makes me want to do it more and harder.” Bam: Both Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland came in and did vocals, and the Houston Chronicle, in 2013, reported it with this lede: “Beyoncé doesn’t do backup. Unless you’re her husband. Or Kitten Kay Sera.” Says Kitten, with a wink, “I was tickled pink.” The good news is Kitten doesn’t mind venturing out into a world that isn’t as pink as she is. When she travels, she might bring her own bedsheets, but she mostly relies on the pink contents of her pink suitcases to give hotel rooms a rosy glow. Her favorite drink is a pinktini—a martini with pomegranate juice—or strawberry Nesquik, but she enjoys food too much to keep to a pink diet.   When it comes to love, though, pink appreciation is a must-have. “I had a date with this guy. We go out and halfway through the date, I’m like, ‘So what do you think?’ Because usually I get some kind of comment. And he said, ‘Oh, you’re wearing pink? It’s all gray to me. I’m color-blind,’” she says, giggling at the memory. “I need someone who can appreciate the pink and see how great it is. So I gave him the pink slip.”     Ultimately, Kitten’s goal is to produce a documentary about herself and some of the world’s other monochromatics (she’s not the only one, although she is the pinkest), as well as write her autobiography, tentatively titled My Big Pink Life. Beyond that, it’s que sera, sera for Kitten Kay Sera, and if you don’t like it, you’re the one missing out. “Not everyone is going to love everything I do or who I am, but I think if you are true to yourself and are genuinely happy with your life and yourself it really doesn’t matter,” Kitten says.  “Sometimes people are going to reject you because you shine too brightly for them. Baby, I’m a shine machine.” Visit the Fug Girls on their website, or follow them on Twitter. Their book, The Royal We, is available here.

			 Turns out shoulder pads actually can look chic?  Turns out OTT '80s fashion trends, like puffy sleeves, ruffles, and shoulder pads, are more fashionable that you thought. These 30 styles from the decade are making a modern comeback—both on and off the runway.  Juicy Couture Velour Pullover, $168 SHOP NOW Juicy Couture Velour Pant, $148 SHOP NOW Most commonly associated with Juicy Couture, velour popped up on sweaters and tracksuits everywhere in the '80s. The velvety, stretchy fabric has come back in a major way, most recently when Juicy Couture released a collaboration with VFILES, as seen here during London Fashion Week in February.   Calvin Klein Sleeveless Patchwork Denim Sheath Dress, $90 SHOP SIMILAR Patchwork denim rose in popularity in the '70s and continued to be a major trend over the next decade due to its quintessential Americana aesthetic. Here, a model wears the look at the Valerie runway show during Stockholm fashion week in August 2017.  LoveShackFancy Allegra Dress, $375 SHOP SIMILAR When you think of prom fashion during the 1980s, shiny lamé dresses are probably the first thing that comes to mind. Here, a model at Ulla Johnson's runway show in February wears a modern take on lamé: a one-shoulder metallic dress with ruffle details and suede boots.  Band of Gypsies Floral Print Off the Shoulder Top, $59 SHOP SIMILAR This shoulder-baring style is found in every clothing store today, but it was commonplace in '80s classics like Flashdance, Heathers, Pretty in Pink, and Ghostbusters. Whitney Houston and Madonna were also fans of the style during that period. In this photo, a model walks the Zimmermann runway show in September 2017 wearing an off-the-shoulder floral top and matching skirt. BDG High-Rise Straight + Narrow Jean, $79 SHOP SIMILAR You might know them as "mom jeans," but this high-rise, slightly baggy style really has taken off in the fashion world recently—goodbye for now, skinny, low-rise jeans! Here, Jordyn Woods wears on-trend wide-leg, past-the-bellybutton jeans backstage at the Chromat show in September 2017.  Scunci Wide Stretch Basic Headwraps, $12 SHOP SIMILAR  Headbands (especially when worn with teased hair) were such a staple of the '80s—rockstars like Steven Tyler and pop queens like Madonna often wore the accessory. Here, Hailey Baldwin gets in on the look at the September 2017 amfAR gala in Milan.  Richer Poorer Blink Classic Ankle Sock, $12 SHOP SIMILAR Ankle socks worn with heels or sneakers were a classic '80s style—the slouchier, the better. While in the aughts it was more about hiding your socks with lower-rise pairs, now, it seems showing your sock is making a fashionable return—from street-style stars pairing them  with designer pumps, seen here during Paris Fashion Week, to off-duty models wearing them with their dad shoes.  Dannijo Mathilde Crystal Drop Earrings, $350 SHOP SIMILAR Statement jewelry like rhinestone earrings—especially in clip-on form—necklaces, and bracelets were popular in the '80s because their loud look went perfectly with the decade's bold perms and colorful eyeshadow. Tom Ford's runway show in February channeled the era with his excessive silver jewelry, seen here on Kaia Gerber.  Y.A.S. Ruffle Maxi Dress with Lace Inserts, $174 SHOP SIMILAR The fact that ruffles were a major '80s trend comes as no surprise when you imagine, again, prom during that time. Nowadays, the style is more refined, as seen on the frilled sleeves and hem of this maxi dress at Tory Burch's runway show in February. Rachel Rachel Roy Acid Wash Denim Jacket, $139 SHOP SIMILAR One of the edgier '80s styles was acid-washed denim, which reflected the rock 'n' roll culture of the time period. A model at Ralph Lauren's runway show in February wears the style by sporting a bleached jacket and matching jeans.  Hanes Pantyhose, $18 SHOP SIMILAR Black sheer tights were a red carpet staple seen on actresses from Sarah Jessica Parker to Vanessa Williams, and three decades later, the trend is popping back up. At Libertine's runway show in February, a model sports transparent black tights (albeit with some embroidery), paired with a skirt and jacket.  RIXO London Leopard-Print Silk-Crepe Wrap Skirt, $325 SHOP SIMILAR Another OTT '80s trend? Animal-print everything. The decade was all about wild, loud patterns, so the spots and stripes of leopards, cheetahs, and zebras were everywhere. Animal print made a serious comeback in various Fall/Winter 2018 collections, such as Tom Ford and Max Mara, pictured here.  ASOS Boxy Body With Shoulder Pads, $45 SHOP SIMILAR Shoulder pads are arguably the fashion trend most synonymous with the era, and although it's oft-ridiculed, designers recently brought back the silhouette by making it more modern. The extra padding exaggerates your shoulders, but it can still look chic, as seen in this fitted, sharp blazer at the Louis Vuitton runway show in March.  PETERSYN Alexis Puff-Sleeve Top, $225 SHOP SIMILAR Along similar lines as shoulder pads, statement puffy sleeves also have become fashionable again. They were featured at the Stella McCartney runway show in March.  Marc Jacobs Mickey-Print Denim Mini Skirt, $350 SHOP SIMILAR From Harley Davidson to Disney's Mickey Mouse and Coca-Cola, wearing a logo was also a huge trend of this period. Branded merch has resurfaced with the rise of "logomania," such as this Disney-inspired Opening Ceremony runway show in March.  Vans Old Skool Original Sneaker, $60 SHOP NOW Skate culture really took off during this time, and Vans' classic checkerboard pattern became super popular thanks to Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. In addition to those infamous slip-ons, the brand's "Old Skool" silhouette later gained traction and continues to appear today, as seen in this photo from Paris Fashion Week in March. Ballet Beautiful Stretch Knit Legwarmers, $70 SHOP SIMILAR You might immediately think of Flashdance when you hear the term "leg-warmers," but this style goes beyond the '80s hit that helped popularize it. In March, these leg-warmer shoes hit the runway during China Fashion Week, proving that they're not just for dance class.  J. Crew Regent Blazer, $198 SHOP SIMILAR J. Crew Slim Crop Pant, $80 SHOP SIMILAR Melanie Griffith gave everyone major power suit inspo in the 1988 movie Working Girl, and the trend has sprung back up today, appearing on models like Karlie Kloss and, more recently, on royalty when Meghan Markle was spotted in the style.  Forever 21 Sheer Mesh Top, $15 SHOP SIMILAR You easily could find people in the '80s club scene layering bras and shirts under mesh fabric, and the same holds true today. At Coachella, Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio wears a black mesh crop top over a white bralette with black high-waist cutoffs. Free People Mermaid Mini Party Dress, $300 SHOP SIMILAR If you remember watching Olympic figure skating in the '80s, or even if you've just seen pictures of the outfits, you'll know that sequins were definitely a Thing. Now, the trend looks a little more polished. Take, for instance, this iridescent sequin midi shown at Barcelona Bridal Week in April. Le Specs Luxe Nero Angled Metal Cat-Eye Mirrored Sunglasses, $119 SHOP SIMILAR  Sunglasses with colored lenses, such as these red, yellow, and blue ones spotted at a Ray-Ban party in May 2018, were all the rage just three decades ago.  ASOS Mini Skirt in Colored Check, $48 SHOP SIMILAR Tory Sport Pleated Mini Skirt, $110 SHOP SIMILAR Mini skirts were rampant  in the fictional high-school halls of '80s flicks like Heathers and Teen Witch. Here, Sophie Turner and Laura Harrier wear short skirts to attend Louis Vuitton's Resort Collection in May.  Alpha Industries MA-1 Bomber Jacket, $150 SHOP SIMILAR Whether they were made from leather or nylon, bomber jackets reached their peak coolness in the 1986 classic Top Gun. Now, the silhouette has been adopted by streetwear brands like Stüssy and Supreme as well as fashion designers like Alexander Wang, whose resort 2019 runway show in June featured a plethora of bomber jackets, like the one pictured here.  Lovers + Friends Be Fierce Dress, $148 SHOP SIMILAR Have you seen a Richard Simmons '80s workout video? Well, either way, fitness gurus from that period definitely made the case for neon colors with their bright sweatbands, leotards, and leg-warmers. The Kardashian-Jenners have been wearing the blinding hues A LOT as of late, such as this neon-orange mini dress Kendall wore in June to a LOVE magazine party.  Old Navy Mid-Rise Compression Shorts, $18 SHOP SIMILAR Madonna and Princess Diana were fans of bike shorts back in the day, and, thanks to Yeezy's new designs, Kim Kardashian really has gone all-in on the trend, and the rest of her fam quickly followed suit. Case in point: Kourtney Kardashian wearing these black shorts at the airport with a simple, long-sleeve shirt and Yeezy sneakers.  HARLYN Mixed Lace Gown, $172 SHOP SIMILAR Madonna's white lace dress with matching gloves was iconic when she performed "Like a Virgin" at the MTV Movie Awards in 1984, and it cemented lace as a definite trend of that decade. Now, it's back again, as seen on model Adwoa Aboah in this strapless black number at a Chanel party in June.   ASOS Original Mom Jeans, $60 SHOP SIMILAR The blossoming grunge culture of the '80s, thanks to bands like Nirvana, Pixies, and Sonic Youth, gave way to edgier trends like super distressed jeans. Here, Bella Hadid sports a torn-up pair in June 2018 with a bright yellow top and black sneakers.  Forever 21 Open Back One-Piece Swimsuit, $25 SHOP SIMILAR Victoria's Secret Model Leomie Anderson is seen wearing a white high-cut bodysuit in July 2018, but the pelvic bone-baring style is totally reminiscent of the iconic, bright-red one-pieces worn in the television show Baywatch, which debuted in 1989.  Gap Basic Leggings, $30 SHOP SIMILAR Olivia Newton John famously wore a pair of skintight black leggings in the 1978 movie Grease, and the tight-fitting trend really took off at the turn of the decade. Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier even had a pair walk down the runway for his Spring/Summer '88 collection. Today, the spandex style has found its way into denim with "jeggings," but the more classic pairs are still thriving as well, like these worn by Gigi Hadid in July.  Balenciaga New York Cotton Jersey Hoodie, $895 SHOP NOW Graffiti artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Fab 5 Freddy took off during this time period, and, in 1981, they were featured in Blondie's "Rapture" music video. The '80s hip-hop scene resulted in streetwear that replicated spray paint. Now, high-fashion brands from Burberry to Balenciaga, seen here on Taylor Swift in July, are embracing the style.

			 It's amazing what a little tape and some extra bra straps can do. If you hate going braless but still love complicated, strappy, backless, and plunging dresses, finding a practical bra you can wear without the straps showing can be a challenge. But where traditional bras fail, these weird and wonderful non-bras step in to save the day, keeping you lifted and in place, even in the most challenging dresses.  Strapless bras are great in theory, but in reality, they slip, especially if you are larger than a C-cup. Bodysuits, on the other hand, prevent the cups from sliding down and offer the kind of legit support that strapless bras and bustiers can only aspire to. They really are the only viable option for women with larger chests.  For longer-lasting lift, try going down a size in the body or band and up a size in cups.  SHOP THE BODYSUIT Women's Sexy Lace Firm Control Convertible Bodybriefer, MAIDENFORM (Available at Amazon), $35  These straps attach to a normal bra and wrap around the front of your torso to make the back dip lower. They'll give you those much-needed extra couple of inches you need to pull off that slightly-too-low-backed dress, like this lacy yellow number.  SHOP THE CONVERTER Low Back Bra Straps-Converter, RETON (Available at Amazon), $7  They help hide your bra straps and give you a little extra lift and cleavage too. SHOP THE CLIPS 3-Piece Bra-Strap Clips, RAZOR CLIPS (Available at Amazon), $6  The front closure helps bring your breasts together, and the convertible straps give you lift that otherwise would be impossible, although they only really work on A, B, and C cups. SHOP THE STICKY BRA Silicone Bra Self Adhesive Invisible Push-up Bra, ELETER (Available at Amazon), $40  Perfect for necklines that extend below your sternum, like this mini dress with a deep V and flutter sleeves.  SHOP THE PLUNGE BRA Women's Deep-Plunge Convertible V-Bra, TOBEINSTYLE (Available at Amazon), $18 These bras can't do much for you in terms of lift, but they're great for keeping you covered, and you can create more cleavage by pulling the drawstring tighter. They're perfect for tricky dresses that have thin straps and are backless.  SHOP THE DRAWSTRING BRA Mousand Strapless Invisible Silicone Bra, HOLIHOUSE (Available at Amazon), $17  For C-cups and under, these breast petals will make you feel covered and prevent nip-slips. They're also painless to take off (i.e. they're sticky enough to stay on, but won't leave any red marks) and sweat-resistant, so they'll stay on even if they get wet.  SHOP THE NIPPLE PETALS Nipple Cover Breast Petals, JOKEL (Available at Amazon), $10 If all else fails, there's always good, old-fashioned medical-grade adhesive tape. It's perfect for especially challenging dresses that are asymmetric, like this one with its off-center neckline and mesh insert in the back, and it even works on larger chests. In fact, in most cases, it's the only thing that actually will work on D-cups and larger. Just make sure to spot-test before committing for the night, and protect your nipple from the strong adhesive by placing a circle of tissue between it and the tape.  SHOP THE TAPE Low Trauma Tape For Sensitive Skin, Pack of 2, NEXCARE (Available at Amazon), $16 Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 They've cost over $28,000! Meghan Markle has shown off impressive personal style as she assimilates into the royal family, but some outfits have come at a royally steep price. (That white Amanda Wakeley coat she wore on Commonwealth Day with the Queen cost almost $2,000.) The future duchess' outfits for official events have already totaled $28,688 so far—so who’s covering the charges?    Meghan and Harry are paying for the wardrobe themselves, People reports, since it's against royal protocol to accept free clothes.  The Duchess of Cambridge famously "has a policy not to accept any free offers of clothing," a spokesperson for the royal told People in 2011. She didn't "receive any special clothing budget" for her royal tour of Canada and California that year, her rep added. "She doesn’t take free clothes, and I’ve heard that from other people who sent her things," designer Katherine Hooker, whose designs the Duchess has worn—and bought, told Huffington Post in 2013. Even though assistants (like Kate Middleton's right-hand, Natasha Archer) may call in a few looks from designers, they'll send back the unused clothes and pay for the pieces that were worn. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge source their expenses from money they receive from Prince Charles' $28 million Duchy of Cornwall income, People adds. Last year, the three reportedly spent about $4.8 million of that fund for salaries, office costs and other business-related expenses—including wardrobes. Since she's not yet married to Harry, Markle doesn't benefit from Prince Charles' funding. But she will after her wedding on May 19. Until then, she'll have to buy all her designer clothing out of pocket.  Markle has an estimated net worth of $5 million, while Harry's is estimated to be at least $25 million, Money reports. The former actress reportedly made $50,000 per episode of Suits, making her annual salary $450,000, according to Fortune. Take a look back at some of the most stylish (and ~expensive~) looks Markle has worn in the royal public eye. There's this Alexander McQueen suit, which consists of a $1,995 blazer and $795 pair of trousers. SHOP There was this Stella McCartney silk belted coat, retailing for $1,881 (£1,350). There was also Markle's Christmas look—consisting of a Sentaler coat, Philip Treacy hat, Chloé bag, Stuart Weitzman boots, and Birks earrings—that reportedly totaled at almost $10,000. And last but not least, there's the stunning Ralph & Russo couture gown Markle wore in her engagement portraits. The dress cost $75,000 and was "privately purchased," Kensington Palace confirmed to Daily Mail.  Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to release this official portrait photograph to mark their engagement. The photograph was taken by photographer @alexilubomirski earlier this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST

			 "She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years." Kate Spade's husband Andy just released a personal statement about her passing. The designer was found dead of apparent suicide in her Park Avenue home yesterday, and Andy's statement sets the record straight on some of the rumors surrounding her death.  He wrote that Kate had been seeking help for depression and anxiety for years, working with doctors actively. There was no substance or alcohol abuse involved, he wrote, and both he and their daughter Beatrice were in touch with her before she died. He also addressed the alleged suicide note his wife left.

			 Big carrots > big carats, amirite?  Think about it. When’s the last time you saw a huge-ass, wait-is-that-actually-real diamond on the perfectly manicured finger of your #Engaged friend’s “Some personal news!” Insta post?  Even scrolling through the #ISaidYes hashtag on the ’gram, you’ll only spot a small number of  big ole rocks. So...kinda seems like that whole “the bigger, the better” thing just ain’t it for the 20- and 30-something crowd. “I’m not a flashy person,” says 29-year-old Rachel Bonenfant, who got engaged last October. “Having a big stone was never something that excited me.” Jewelry trend expert and designer Tara Gannon started noticing millennials requesting smaller stones about two years ago—and by “smaller,” we mean those hovering around the one-carat neighborhood. “They wanted higher-quality diamonds that had more brilliance and fire even if it meant not as many carats,” she says. “This led to a trend of more stackable rings, unique bands, and smaller stones.”   Ringing everyday 💅🏻💎 #anitako #rings A post shared by  Anita Ko (@anitakojewelry) on Feb 17, 2019 at 5:47pm PST  You might suspect cost is the reason for the shift, and while it may be a factor, it’s not actually the biggest one. The new emphasis is on quality, which means people could be spending more and getting something smaller (pick your jaw back up)!  “Having a big ring isn’t what matters to me,” says Carly de Castro, the 34-year-old cofounder of Pressed Juicery, who, after being married for six years, recently resized her blinding double-halo setting for a simpler model. “I’d rather have a smaller, higher-quality diamond that’s understatedly radiant, tasteful, and true to myself.”  FYI: The national average price of an engagement ring is $5,600, according to The Knot’s 2018 Real Weddings Study, and that can get you anything from a grain-of-rice-size stone to a substantial—yet flawed (but maybe not to the naked eye)—piece.     Starting this hot L.A. day with some ice ❄️ 💎 #anitako #bluejeans and #diamonds A post shared by  Anita Ko (@anitakojewelry) on Apr 10, 2018 at 7:19am PDT  That’s due to the four C’s: cut, carat weight, clarity, and color. For context: At a name-brand jeweler, $5,600 may fetch you a platinum setting with a round-cut stone weighing less than half a carat (read: that grain-of-rice sitch). On an online market place, the same amount of money could buy you a diamond lingering in the one-carat range, which measures approximately 6.5 millimeters—that’s just the diamond, though, not the setting. But it’s that one-carat threshold that many girls want to hit, just for the sake of saying their ring is a solid carat. Now back to that whole “brilliance and fire” thing—that’s what makes your ring *sparkle.* Amanda Gizzi, spokesperson for Jewelers of America, a nonprofit trade organization, says a well-cut diamond will bring that out, no matter how big it is. And if capturing that shimmer on Insta is what you’re after, there are apps that can add glitter effects and make your stones shine extra bright. So why, after years of supersize rocks indicating status, do we legit not care about that (as much)? Los Angeles-based jewelry designer Ariel Gordon, whose celebrity clientele includes Gigi Hadid, Lauren Conrad, Jessica Alba, and Chrissy Teigen, thinks it’s all about practicality and versatility. In other words: staying power.   “People want their jewelry to work at school drop-off, in meetings, on date night, and at the farmer’s market,” she says. “If your pieces are delicate, they transition well into any activity, which means you can wear them more.”   This delicate duo FTW #showmeyourrings⁣⠀ A post shared by  Ariel Gordon (@arielgordonjewelry) on Apr 11, 2019 at 6:38am PDT “I’m really active, so having something I didn’t have to take on and off and could wear no matter what I’m doing is important to me,” Bonenfant says. “I still wear a necklace my mom gave me when I was 17—I haven’t taken it off for 12 years!” Smaller stones are so on-trend that Des Kohan, owner, buyer, and designer for her eponymous boutique in L.A. says over the past three years, she’s helped dozens of clients redesign existing rings or make completely new ones with smaller diamonds.  “The common denominator is that these are all working women, and they don’t feel comfortable wearing larger stones in downtown L.A., Venice, or even in Hollywood.” Five years ago, she says she only had a couple of inquiries about redesigning rings, but today, she’s seen a sudden spike in requests to make totally new, smaller, everyday rings. Kohan has even found that clients who have larger rocks make excuses for their rings: “They’ll say, ‘It was a hand-me-down,’ or ‘It was my mom’s stone,’ to justify wearing it.” BTW, the halo, a once-popular setting, mostly used to make smaller stones appear larger, is kinda dead unless it has a distinctive design element. “We’ve seen a decrease in that type of design aesthetic—there’s less framing now,” says fine jeweler Anita Ko, who designed Kate Upton’s ring in 2016.   Stacked and ready for Summer 🌼🌸☀️ #anitako #rings A post shared by  Anita Ko (@anitakojewelry) on May 15, 2019 at 3:53pm PDT De Castro felt like the two halos that formerly surrounded her 1.2-carat stone were too much. “I was tired of the pavé and felt like it was hiding the beauty and simplicity of the stone. It was too heavy,” she says. Added bonus: She used the excess stones that previously surrounded her diamond to make a brand-new band. Tess Alpern, a 29-year old who lives on the Upper East Side, used her late grandmother’s 1.55-carat, 1940s art deco ring when she got engaged. While the emerald-cut diamond was originally set vertically, which made it stand out more, Alpern, a kindergarten teacher who admittedly doesn’t wear much jewelry (because: hello, kids!) opted instead for something simple, delicate, and wearable. “I showed NYC-based jeweler Jamie Wolf the diamond, and she immediately suggested a horizontal, rose gold, bezel setting and it came out perfectly,” she says. “It doesn’t look like any other engagement ring I’ve ever seen.”  Meanwhile, New York City-based jewelry designer Stephanie Gottlieb has also noticed brides using what would traditionally be thought of as more of a diamond wedding band as their engagement rings. “This is about the practicality of a band versus a larger solitaire for everyday,” she says. “They usually end up stacking two bands when they get married, which I love.”  “P U R A  V I D A” 🔥 A post shared by  Stephanie Gottlieb (@stephaniegottlieb) on Apr 24, 2019 at 4:11pm PDT That’s exactly what Bonenfant did when she said “yes.” “I always knew I wanted something that wasn’t traditional,” she says. “I really liked the idea of having something that could become stackable over the years.” Honestly? You do you and, um, anyone who gets snooty about the size of your ring—big or small—can kindly see themselves TF out. “I didn’t think about what anyone else thought about my ring when I redid the setting,” says de Castro. “I’m the one that wears it, and as long as I love it, that’s all that matters.”

			 Just another reason your Prime membership is the best.   Whether you're shopping for her birthday, Mother's Day, or just because, here's 25 pretty—and useful!—gifts (all found on Amazon, BTW) she would love to receive, no matter the occasion.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Treat her to the fluffiest, comfiest cloud slides that she'll want to wear all day, every day.  A journal she can use to write down some reflective thoughts will help her unwind each night.  A celeb-favorite sunscreen (which doesn't have that strong sunscreen smell, FYI) will conveniently fit in her makeup bag or purse for easy application on the go. Its lightweight, water-resistant formula will make it her new essential.  An ombré picture frame is cute, but when it has a pic of the two of you in it? Even cuter.  She can use this bottle just for water, but it also comes with a built-in juice press so she can add fun fruit flavoring.  She'll always have a reminder of how much you love her with this dainty gold "eye heart u" bracelet.  A straw bag with a beaded strap and secure tie is perfect for the warmer weather ahead.  Does she like being her coziest self? A top-rated fluffy robe in a neutral shade is one she won't want to take off.  She'll love wearing a delicate ring with her name in cursive script.  An eyeshadow palette featuring stunning shades of copper, blush, and violet is great for a day-to-night makeup look.  Whether she's hitting the gym or just taking a casual stroll, a pair of soft knit sneaks she can slip on (no lacing required!) will feel heavenly.  Give her the perfect carry-on bag for her next trip thanks to this style's protective hard case and spinner wheels.  This mug will keep her drink hot for up to five hours (or cold up for to 10), so she can be on the go and not have to worry about her morning coffee losing its steam.  A "just-the-right-size" tote that has textured pebbled leather and also comes with a crossbody strap is one she'll want to bring everywhere.  Her morning routine will become so much easier with a travel-size day and hydration serum. She'll seriously have the best dang skin with Drunk Elephant's cult-fave products.  A case that also happens to keep her battery at 100 percent will keep her texting all day long. (You know she's all over that emoji keyboard.)   High-waisted leggings are great for working out, but with moto detailing, they also make trendy pants she can wear out.  A soothing candle that smells like peonies and rose petals will turn any room into a calming oasis.  She'll be obsessed with all the recipes in Chrissy's popular cookbook and will hopefully make a few dishes for you—if you're lucky.  A monogrammed dish for all her little trinkets and jewelry pieces will keep her organized, but it also looks cute on a nightstand.  She'll be wireless and free of untangling headphone cords for good with a cool pair of AirPods.  Face masks galore! She'll go crazy for the ones in this set (including a 24k gold option?!) and have fun figuring out her favorites.  A super soft jumpsuit that looks as good with Birkenstocks as it does with sneakers is a great present if she likes looking sporty but casual.  A wine stopper that preserves taste after she removes the cork means she can get more use out of every bottle. Yes. please.  A gorge necklace with her initial (or a special someone else's) is a thoughtful but elegant gift.

			 Sometimes you need a tight deadline and 12 sexy undergarments to burn through.  When a 12-piece box of mystery lingerie from Lovehoney appeared at my desk in late November, I was both intrigued and preemptively tired. It's not that I've never bought a cute bralette for the dual purpose of having a comfy bra AND taking things up a notch in the bedroom, but the idea of actively encasing myself in a semi-complicated lace bodysuit only to have it be taken off moments later feels like work.  Also, strutting around in a steamy 'lil number while a guy just gets to wear his typical cotton boxers always makes me feel like Marge Simpson twirling in a negligee in front of her famously subpar husband. I'm just a little salty that there's no real Yandy equivalent for straight men, while women's lingerie is usually skimpy and see-through—not exactly something you're dying to wear when your apartment doesn't have heat yet. 
  Alas, I enjoy free stuff and also sex, so I decided to try the advent calendar (which comes in one-size or plus-size). Here's how it went! Day 1: A stretchy, fishnet bodysuit. The very first cellophane-sealed (and impressively compact!) piece I pulled out was a spaghetti-strap black fishnet one-piece. Holding it up and peeking through the holes, I pictured it to be like wearing a Rocky Horror Picture Show stocking as a bodysuit, but when it was actually on me, I noticed more of a detailed floral design, which was nice. All in all, it was very pliable, really easy to slip on, and unexpectedly comfy, to the point that I kind of forgot I was wearing it throughout (it, like many other pieces in this collection, had no crotch, so I kept it on the whole time). It was just the thing to kick off a morning quickie—an awesome low effort, high hotness payoff.  Day 2 and Day 3: Lace stockings and a matching bra/thong combo. Ok, I'm incredibly lazy, so it should come as no surprise that I combined some of these into full-blown outfits to give myself a break. But also, TBH, some of these pieces didn't feel complete without a little ~more~ to them. I mean, if you're going to make the effort to roll on stockings, you might as well go all out, right?  I LOVED the stockings, mostly because I'm a sucker for lace but also because they had little elastic details that truly kept them on the whooooole time.  As for look as a whole: My boyfriend and I have very polarizing opinions when it comes to thongs on me: he's very into it, I am very much not (thongs can be *so* uncomfortable). But these were softer—and adjustable!—so I didn't mind too much. The bra, with it's nipple-slits, also felt hilariously risqué to me, but he was really into the vibe and definitely wanted to savor it.  My personal, very correct rule about this: However many minutes it took you to put this thing on—multiply it by ten. That's how long your partner should go down on you.  Day 4 and 5: Red heart pasties and a matching lace bodysuit. Another 2-for-1-er, but, I gotta say, this one got a little too campy for me. It was my first time ever wearing pasties, and giant red hearts felt especially silly, but also fun and something I'd probably never try otherwise. Adding another exposed-nipple one-piece suit over it made me feel like the world's most diehard Valentine's Day sex enthusiast. We both laughed at the heart-nips, which, hey, if you can't share a goof in bed while still wanting to bone each other, that's a problem, IMO. In general, I wouldn't recommend doing themed lingerie sets with anyone who you can't feel vulnerable around, both because of moments like these (and ones where it takes you 12 minutes to figure out how a strap works). Day 6: Red stockings. Since these were just the red version of the same black stockings I wore earlier, and because we wouldn't see each other for a few days, I decided to send my boyfriend a NSFW snap.  It was nice, because I often do forget how fun sexting is and how little effort it actually takes. He was happy, and I felt in the mood to dig through my vibrator drawer. All because of stockings. Day 7: An absolutely WILD fishnet suit. There's a first for everything, including a fishnet-paneled bodysuit with matching stockings ATTACHED to it. First off, I did not fully understand how to even put this on, but I persevered and somehow got into the thing. I would like to note, though, that unlike the model below, mine didn't come with a thong–it was an open field of crotch 'n' butt, which is funny considering how much the rest of me was covered up.  Real talk: This is 100 percent too complicated for me to ever have bought for myself. But it was, er, different, and again, an experience. I felt like the sexy space alien lead in an amateur porno (in the best possible way). As for my partner, he said "ooooooh" a lot when he saw it, which translates to "This look is a LOT, but I still have a boner." Day 8 and 9: A red thong and a bodycon slip. The red thong had some cute, heart-shaped details which made me soften to the idea of wearing a thong again.  The slip was definitely the most covered-up piece of lingerie in the collection, and the most form-fitting. Personally, I feel my best in billow-y, flowy items rather than anything that clings. This piece felt the least like me and the most like a Kardashian photoshoot waiting to happen. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I got bullied for my butt in high school and showing it off still feels foreign to me sometimes.  Once I spun around in this a few times (much to the excitement of my boyfriend), I liked the dress a bit more.  Day 10: Another wild fishnet contraption. This was another stockings-attached-to-bodysuit piece, but I liked the floral detailing on it more. I felt like an extra in "Lady Marmalade," which, when it comes to bedroom attire, is very good. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? I damn well would. Once again, my vagina and ass were fully exposed, but honestly, the concept's grown on me. They're the rightful stars of the show, and it's good for your partner to be reminded of that. Day 11 and 12: A red lace, ribbon-tie thong and flowy top. On our last day, we spent time with my boyfriend's family and stayed in a hotel for the night. Instead of yelling at him to keep his eyes closed while I fumbled around with ribbon ties in my room, I got to do it in the privacy of a huge bathroom and dramatically strut out in this: Just in time for the holidays, I felt like an ~expensive~ Christmas present and was actually sad to untie everything because the top looked so flirty 'n' fun. It was great to cap things off in the look I felt the most confident in. At first, he was iffy on sex since we had to meet everyone downstairs in 20 minutes, but it's safe to say he doesn't regret the decision to have an extra AF quickie. Final thoughts: All in all, I was impressed with how well most of these fit, and the fact that the thongs and underwear could be adjusted to your waist line. While some took a second to figure out, I successfully got everything on (and off). This challenge was actually awesome for my sex life, because it gave us something to look forward to and pushed me out of my mid-Netflix-binge boning sesh comfort zone. I think it was also fun because we didn't feel like it *had* to be every day for 12 days straight or anything intense like that—doing it that way could quickly feel like a chore or pressure to force yourself to get into the mood.  So, yeah, once I muster enough effort to hand-wash all of these, it's definitely time for round two.  Follow Julia on Twitter.

			 No laces, no problem.  Dealing with laces can be a pain when (a) they never stay tied (b) you're in a rush and (c) you're going through airport security. If you've never tried slip-ons, they are simply life-changing, and if you already have a bunch of pairs, it never hurts to have more, right?! Here, 17 of the very best lace-free styles you'll want in your shoe closet.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! The Vans checkerboard pattern is iconic, and this style has an almost perfect 5-star rating. Basically, when it comes to slip-ons, this one is an absolute necessity.  The padded footbed on these guys supports your feet while walking; plus, they come in seven other colors if you love having options.  These are popular for a reason: Not only are they cheeky thanks to the cute winking embroidery, but the canvas material also stretches and fits to your feet. (Just size up as most reviews say they run a bit small!) If you love a cute print, try out these pretty Keds (and yes, that's a Rifle Paper Co floral design!). The multicolored style will complement any outfit.  These backless Supergas look like a pair of regular sneakers from the front but a slide from behind.   Whether you are changing at the gym or going on a run, pulling a slip-on over your feet makes getting ready so much faster. These APLs have a stretchy knit material, while the thick band ensures your foot is secure and doesn't slide out.  A pair with a platform is great if you want some extra height. This one has 400 5-star reviews and comes in nine additional prints, textures, and hues.  This material makes any shoe more breathable—especially helpful on hot summer days. The mesh will feel breezy on your feet, and the cushioned footbed is also a major plus.   If you love Converse but hate tying knots, this is the style for ya. The laces on these stay fixed, and the elastic back makes it easy to pull right over your heel. So now you can wear your classic Chuck Taylors with zero effort.   Want more of a luxe vibe? Opt for a pair of nubuck and leather ones, which come in 10(!!!) other shades, that are handmade in Italy.  Yes, they might be called "loungers," but you can also wear 'em out in public too! The padded insole feels like a dream, but it also wicks away moisture, which reduces any not-so-great odors.  With more than 500 5-star reviews, these Blowfish slip-ons are an absolute must. The shoes are super flexible so they form to your feet with each step, while the eyelets still give them that traditional "sneaker" look even without laces.  If you're going for a summery lewk, espadrille slip-ons are just the thing. These navy and white ones have a nautical aesthetic, while the perforated material is breathable and oh-so soft.  Yes, technically these have laces, but you don't have to tie and untie them every time you get in and out of your shoes; plus, the soles on these have a zig-zag tread for extra traction in slippery conditions.  A pair of gray and white slides will go with any outfit, and the thick sole on these means they'll hold up over time.  If a casual yet cute style is what you're going for, slip on this sleek pair for size. The soft material is actually made with recycled plastic, and they're machine-washable if you happen to get 'em a little dirty.  The footbed on these black bbs actually has not one, but FOUR layers of foam, and even with constant wear, the black Italian leather will really last.

			 The Fug Girls reflect on what it meant to call one of her purses your own. The love affair, like so many, started at Bloomingdale’s. It was the early aughts, and we were in our early 20s. No longer new college grads but certainly not fully-minted adults (no matter how much we wanted to be), we were in that phase of reaching for things that at least might make us look self-sufficient and independent and grown-up, even though we knew that we still had no idea what we were doing.  And so anytime we stepped into that accessories department, our longings took us straight to a cheerful, colorful display strewn with nylon box bags and satiny single-strap evening purses, slim baguettes, and makeup cases — all in rich hues, sassy stripes, witty little cherries, or that signature large black polka dot. The Kate Spade table was our Mecca, and we regularly came to worship. Tragically, Kate Spade was found dead in New York this week at age 55, having apparently taken her own life. We, of course, never knew her as the many other things she was — a businesswoman, a journalist, a mother to Frances and aunt to actress Rachel Brosnahan, a wife to Andy — but, like so many other women, we carry in our hearts the indelible image of that corner of designer sunshine and what it meant to us.  There was something profoundly formative about calling one of her purses your own. There was something profoundly formative about being able to call one of her purses your own. A Kate Spade was a splurge, but unlike so many others of that era (the Fendi baguette, a box of Blahniks) it wasn’t a wholly unattainable one — and for so many women who came of age when we did, it was a special hallmark of being able to own a tiny piece of luxury entirely for ourselves, because we wanted to, because we could. Everyone remembers her first. Jessica’s was a classic Kate Spade box bag, raspberry and matte, maybe flannel, which she bought because an older and more glamorous friend — also sadly gone before her time — convinced her it would be a wise investment. (It was, certainly more than the leather pants she also recommended.) Heather’s was a petite, single-strap over-the-shoulder style, soft and almost sateen, in a smoky medium blue with aspirations of being periwinkle. And, of course, both were adorned with the iconic Kate Spade tag: a black cloth rectangle, her name in simple lowercase white letters. For both of us, this was our first designer purchase — that item in your closet where, at last, the brand name is the only descriptor you need. It was gratifying to possess an item that also was its own perfect adjective. No one ever says, “Hang on, let me grab my Bag I Stole From My Sister’s Closet Five Years Ago,” but “I left my lipstick in my Kate Spade” makes perfect natural sense — a satisfying sentence to utter, something that also says, “Hello, I am an adult woman with a real professional purse.” Those purses were talismans of the possibility that, one day, we might be the person they made us feel like we were. We both recall unwrapping our bag from the store’s protective tissue and feeling, finally, ever so mature and self-possessed. We were not — and we probably shouldn’t have dropped even a relatively tame amount of cash on a bag when we had actual adult bills, too — but those purses were talismans of the possibility that, one day, we might be the person they made us feel like we were. Spade hadn’t been personally involved with her eponymous brand in more than a decade — she sold her last shares in 2006, it was bought by Liz Claiborne Inc., and it went around the corporate merry-go-round before becoming Kate Spade & Company — and Deborah Lloyd designed it from 2007-2017 before passing the torch to Nicola Glass. This afternoon, the company website took down its splashy pictures and prompts for e-mail discounts, replacing them with a somber black page that calls her “the visionary founder of our brand” and notes, “We honor all the beauty she brought into this world.” Her influence is still widely felt, and not just in our memories of the early years of the millenium. The brand’s punny, sunny aesthetic grew on the foundation Spade laid and reinforced the notion that high fashion need not be high drama, nor high misery; that those of us who wanted to look like colorful quirky prepsters were not as sartorially alone as we might have felt emerging from the era of grunge; that it was not a sin to opt for a small wicker bag shaped like a dog if we wanted one; that clothing could have a sense of humor; that “cheerful” could, in fact, be a reasonable personal style. Fifteen years ago, it felt like every girl you met had a Kate Spade bag — or a knockoff, which was close enough when you’re 24 years old. Today, that kind of fashionable ubiquity might be sniffed at as being “basic,” but for us, there was comfort in it, a warmth in finding a kindred spirit in a bar’s bathroom line, and an opening to chirp a winking, “I love your bag!” while wiggling our own. Kate Spade purses were not intimidating, and that’s a blessing, not a backhanded compliment. They made all of our young, hopeful smiles a little wider, our spines a little straighter, our steps a little springier. We’d earned our way into having them, and we were proud. Today’s grievous news cuts deep into our nostalgia for those years when we were just figuring things out, and it reminds us that no matter how chipper and perky someone looks on the outside or what she’s carrying on her arm, you never know what she’s carrying in her heart. We are grateful for the memories of those moments in which we were just beginning to feel our own power, and for the fact that Kate Spade was with so many of us when we stepped out, finally, on our own.

			 Seriously, this wallet has changed my life. Can someone tell me why everyday wallets and purses for women are so big? No shade to people who tote around a sh*t ton of stuff all the time, but my back just can't take it. So when I recently interviewed a NYC stylist who refuses to carry a handbag, I wanted in on all her secrets, which she dutifully outlined to me. 
  The one thing that seemed to make the biggest difference: her wallet choice. She doesn't leave home without a vintage Chanel tri-fold key wallet. It's adorable, but more importantly, it has a place for everything she needs to carry around all day (keys and cards) in one small, convenient location. She holds her phone separately. I wanted to give this lifestyle a try so I purchased this $275 number from YSL—and let me tell you, it lives up to all the hype. I haven't used a purse once since it arrived in the mail. When I first ventured outside my apartment—wearing just jeans and a tee, nary a handbag in sight—the door closed and automatically locked behind me, as it always does. I looked down, saw I had only my wallet and phone, and had a minor freakout, thinking I had lost my keys. After making a fool of myself in front of my neighbors, I said to myself, "OMG, everything I need is right here" and was flooded with pure elation: I was free. I haven't had to use a purse once. Since then, this wallet and I have been co-stars in an undying love story. Sure, as a fashion editor, I'd seen key wallets before. But I hadn't given them much thought until I bought one and truly understood the service they bring to anyone hoping to downsize their everyday load. It fits most pockets, whether they're on the back and front of your jeans or a tiny blazer, so you never have to wear a purse again, if you don't want to.  Why is it so revolutionary? It comes down to size. Every wallet I had owned in the past, whether it could hold keys or not—aside from card cases, which, TBH are great, too—was a long one, with a row of little slits for a plethora of cards and a pocket for coins and uncreased bills. Those are so large, they often don't fit in pockets of any size, so they pretty much require a purse, lest you carry them around in one of your hands. They also don't usually fit in small clutches—not ideal when you have to hit a fancier fête. But with my new baby, I simply take it out of the back pocket of my jeans and drop it into my tiny evening bag. No drama. Bye-bye, bag life. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 They're out of this world! First came thigh-high Ugg boots. Naturally, the Internet flipped out. And then, on Thursday night, Jeremy Scott sent thigh-high MOON BOOTS down the runway at his Fall/Winter '18 runway show, and I know what I'm packing for my future vacation to space. Just when you thought the OTT shoe trend was slowing down (remember platform Crocs?), the fashion scene surprises you with a new and weirdly amazing trend.  The moon boots, which feature lace-up details, come in bright colors including neon greens, pinks, and oranges, and they look warm as hell. There are even faux-fur options! Totally necessary footwear for dealing with unbearably cold winters, right? But if the thigh-highs are too extra for you, fear not: Scott also showed classic short pairs, worn by models donning neon wigs.  The moon boots totally make sense considering the show's neon/sci-fi/outer space vibes. Gigi Hadid also walked the runway wearing a short pink wig, an exaggerated orange cat eye, and a metallic space suit-looking dress.  Casual.

			 Her bra top game is STRONG.  On Tuesday, Kourtney Kardashian hit the streets of Rome, Italy, with her main man Younes Bendjima wearing a teeny, tiny Yeezy bra, high-waisted green pants, a Fendi bag, and white sneakers.    The Kardashian-Jenner fam has really taken a liking to this bra top trend, and I fully support it. In April, she wore another one – also by Yeezy – with matching highlighter-colored bike shorts.   #yeezyseason7 A post shared by  Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Apr 16, 2018 at 12:08pm PDT Her boyfriend matched with an olive-green T-shirt, a camouflage hat, and white kicks , which Kourt documented on her Instagram Stories.  When in Rome, a visit to the Trevi Fountain is a must, so Kourt and Younes tossed their coins backwards into it, and also took a massive group photo with some local starstruck Italians.  Other highlights included capturing a wedding, taking in some architecture, and on Wednesday morning, visiting a church while wearing Dior, as one does.  Her romantic Rome vacation comes after reports that her ex, Scott Disick, and 19-year-old Sofia Richie are now living together, and after she was snubbed from Maxim's Hot 100 list. But Kourt doesn't seem fazed at all because she's in freaking Italy, and I'm sure she's enjoying all the amazing pasta and pizza, and, you know, spending time with her hunky model boyfriend.

			 Why is this happening. Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin were spotted out and about in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday, but I truly can't focus on the two of them right now because look at his effing feet:   Guys. GUYS. He is wearing hotel bath slippers out and about and I simply can't focus on anything else. Do we dare zoom in? I know "bathleisure" is supposedly A Thing and all, but I don't know how to feel about the "trend" IRL if this is the form it takes. There are not real soles — any sharp object could just burst right through the bottoms of his slippers — and he's in NYC, where literally anything could be lying on the ground. This is a tetanus shot waiting to happen.  Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 SHE DID THAT.  The year is 2000. Jennifer Lopez is at the Grammy Awards and wears a vibrant green Versace dress. Said dress is so low, like neckline-ends-at-the-belly-button kind of low, that it leads to the invention of Google’s image search. Really. Well, fast-forward 19 years and J.Lo wore almost the exact same look at Versace’s spring/summer 2020 show in Milan. And it is a MOMENT.    You’re welcome. @jlo @versace A post shared by  Laura Brown (@laurabrown99) on Sep 20, 2019 at 11:51am PDT  She literally closed down the catwalk, and everyone got their phones out to capture the greatness that was Jennifer sashaying her way down the runway with a walk that would intimidate the most super of models. And if you thought it was sexy from the front, just wait until you see the back—or the very little fabric that makes it up, anyway.  But back to the fact that J.Lo and Versace inadvertently invented Google Images. The Italian fashion house teased its newest collection with a Google search as a *wink, wink nod, nod* to its v important technological contribution.    Join us on Friday, September 20th at 8PM CEST for the Women’s Spring-Summer 2020 show: streamed live from Milan on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and on Versace.com. #MFW #VersaceSS20 A post shared by  Versace (@versace) on Sep 18, 2019 at 1:23pm PDT  After the well-deserved standing ovation, she posed with designer Donatella Versace on the runway and just generally looked goddamn amazing. Also, shortly before her catwalk appearance, she wore this Sally LaPointe outfit with a huge matching hat. So basically there is nothing this woman can’t wear. Between the Oscar nomination buzz she’s receiving for her role in Hustlers to THIS, it’s proof that this is J.Lo’s world and we’re all just living in it. (And I’m very okay with that.)

			 This color combo is a THING.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. The Emmys red carpet is well underway, and there have been some absolutely MAJOR looks. There was Billy Porter’s giant Stephen Jones hat! Gwendoline Christie’s ancient Roman-looking robe situation! Drag queen Nina West looking glam as hell! And then there was Mandy Moore who graced us with this appearance in a red-and-pink Brandon Maxwell gown and Forevermark jewelry. She (finally!) is nominated tonight for her role in This Is Us and went with this bombshell off-the-shoulder ensemble and big curls.  Costar Susan Kelechi Watson (who’s also starring in the Fred Rogers biopic It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) went with the same gorgeous color scheme in this off-the-shoulder dress. Like, I’m obsessed with puffy sleeves now? The bigger the better.  And folks, the two hues did NOT stop there. Taraji P. Henson picked up on them when she posed in this amazing dress—with a cape!   And the Valentine’s Day vibes kept comin’ with Marisa Tomei’s one-shoulder, two-tone gown featuring a flowy train.  So forget twinning because this was a full-on quadruplet fashion moment! They all look incredible, and I would high-key wear every single outfit. So basically I'm off to buy and wear only red-and-pink clothes from now on. Also, on a closing thought, Emma Stone circa the 2014 Met Gala would definitely approve, just sayin’.

			 In just one year, Susan Alexandra's beaded purses have attracted tons of celeb fans. In June, Gigi Hadid gave everyone FOMO as she Instagrammed her way through a luxe vacation in Mykonos, Greece. Kate Moss and Emily Ratajkowski were in tow, but another, more under-the-radar guest also made its way onto Gigi's feed as she zipped along the deep-blue Aegean Sea—a beaded, multicolor striped handbag by designer Susan Alexandra.   It was an impressive endorsement for Alexandra, a NYC-based jewelry designer who started making her signature beaded bags, ranging from $120 to $345, only a year ago. But in that time she's quickly attracted an A-list following—which also includes models like Ratajkowski and Gigi's sister, Bella—largely thanks to Instagram, which she uses to gauge customer interest in her quirky, whimsical creations. Alexandra, who's also working on a top-secret clothing collaboration to be released within the year, made jewelry for six years before creating her first handbag, a watermelon design, in 2017 in Chinatown. She says it was "pure divine intervention" when she stumbled across a beautiful storefront selling beads. "I asked the lady, 'Is there any way you can take these beads and make a purse with them?'" says the 32-year-old. "I’ve been making jewelry for so long. I never intended to make bags, but when I saw the material I just had this thought that maybe this could be something."  Alexandra says she always would search for cool vintage bags but never found the right ones. So she crafted hers exactly the way she wanted it—rind, seeds, and all.  "From there I was like, 'Let’s see what else we can do that’s just as weird and unusual as possible,' and that’s been my guideline since," she says.  That guideline has led, like her jewelry, to handbags that are at once colorful and unexpected. She draws inspiration from what she loves most, from her favorite colors to fruits to flowers. 
  "I am obsessed with anything beautiful and pretty and sparkly—and a little bit strange," she says. Soon after Alexandra posted her first bag to Instagram, a friend discovered it and told a buyer at Opening Ceremony to check them out. By July, they were sold at the company's stores; now, they're available at other retailers like Shopbop, Moda Operandi, and Garmentory. She receives up to 500 orders on her website each month. Alexandra also uses Instagram to post new designs—she recently started making wallets—as a barometer for how they will sell.  "The feedback from Instagram has been so overwhelming on some pieces that I’m like, 'OK, we have a hit on our hands before we even launch,'" she says, citing her cherry and cow-print bags as examples that people went crazy for. 
  The Chinatown neighborhood in which Alexandra has lived for the past six years also influences her work. Four local artisans, all women, make the purses just a couple blocks away from her apartment. She describes the intricate beading process as similar to using a loom, in which the beads—more than 300 per bag—are handwoven into an interlocking pattern to create the structure of the purse. And although Alexandra is excited about her celebrity following—she cites Gigi's Instagram pic as the driving force behind a recent sales spike—she's even more stoked when she sees regular women carrying her pieces. "It’s so cool when I open my Instagram in the morning and look at my tagged photos—everyday there’s new girls, and they’re all different they’re from all over the world, and they’re all wearing their bags in inspiring, unique ways." And if she happens to see you toting one her purses in the wild? Expect to get stopped. "At first they think I’m a crazy person who's just stopping them on the street," she adds. "And then I’ll say, 'I made that!' and it’s always really really cool." Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 The early bird gets the best boots. In the immortal words of House Stark, “Winter is coming.” Sure, it may still feel like we’re in the middle of summer (paging fall!), but chilly season will be here before you know it. Chances are, you’ll soon be battling below-freezing temperatures, piles of snow, and black ice, so why not stay ahead of Mother Nature by buying cold-weather essentials now? That’s where Amazon comes in. Right now, the retailer is offering Sorel’s popular Joan of Arctic boots for as little as $79. Yes, you read that correctly.  Sorel is known for making practical, comfortable snow boots that don’t sacrifice style—and this pair is no exception. Made with waterproof full-grain leather and suede, the Joan of Arctic offers a sleek, stylish alternative to the bulky snow boots you wore as a kid.

This pair boasts a thick rubber sole that can help combat slick spots, while the removable felt lining will keep your feet from getting soaked—because everyone knows that soggy feet are the freaking WORST. Plus, the boot’s mid-calf height will keep your legs warm!  According to Sorel’s site, the Joan of Arctic boots typically cost $200 (holy paycheck), but thanks to Amazon, you can get them for a lot less. The price might vary based on color and size, but some options cost as little as $79. Whether you’re in need of a new pair for the upcoming season or you want to stockpile these for the years to come, we recommend adding these to your cart stat. GET SOREL JOAN OF ARCTIC BOOTS

			 She's not always in designer heels. Recently, every time Meghan Markle has stepped out, she's looked extremely polished in great dresses and designer heels, but delving back into some photo history reveals that she also loves her comfy styles. Specifically, she has appeared in the same white sneaker — the Reebok Classic Leather — multiple times. In December 2016, before the media frenzy around the royal wedding kicked into high gear, she was just a Suits star filming in Toronto and heading into yoga everyday wearing these kicks. Let's take a look: Ah, simpler times! Though her outfits and hats may change here, the shoes stay the same.   Why does this matter? IDK, maybe it's something about how her recent looks, while absolutely gorge, are a tad expensive, and this casual style comes at a much more affordable price.  If you like Meghan's sneakers, shop them below! SHOP NOW Classic Leather Sneaker, REEBOK, $75 Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Yeehaw, but make it fashion.  Get out your prairie dresses, denim shirts, big-buckled belts, and square-toed boots because it looks like the western trend is IN, folks. I mean, just look at all the Fall/Winter 2018 runway shows that featured cowboy-esque ensembles. Labels like Isabel Marant, Calvin Klein, Chloé, Coach, Alberta Ferretti and more are in on the trend, which is obviously great news for all the secret (and not-so-secret) horse girls out there! If you think it looks great on the runway,  but are having difficulty getting behind it IRL, take a gander at these pieces that'll make you the new fashion police sheriff in town.   
  You're not limited to one "Western" shirt, since there are plenty of washes, patterns, and interpretations. A classic yoke style (i.e. the curved pieces of pattern making up the garment often on the shoulders) is probably the most quintessential aspect that comes to mind, however, a polka-dot print with fringe details or a crochet blouse with a neck-tie also pick up on the vibe without being too on-the-nose.  Wear them with a simple pair of jeans and boots or opt to go even further by adding the below accessories.  Even if you have the best-fitting pants, you can always add a detailed cowboy belt to really make them a focal point. Lots of these come with removable buckles so you can swap them out, just adding to the versatility of the designs. Whether you're a fan of silver or gold (or both!), there's plenty of styles out there with a range of metal accents and etchings, so they'll complement any outfit you choose.  
  Top off your Wild West lewk with these boots that all have a different take on the trend, whether the silhouette is more traditional or has a modern spin. Pair them with stylish cropped flare jeans or culottes, and, if you want more ankle coverage, throw on some straight or skinny-fit pants.  
  Saddle bags had a huge comeback this year (thanks in part to Dior), and countless western-inspired purses followed suit. With their detailed stitching, fringe, and prints, these styles will take your cowgirl outfit to the next level, but if you don't want to go overboard you can also wear them with other pieces you already own.   Can't get enough? Shop all the pieces above for more rodeo-worthy vibes that'll inspire you to learn how to lasso—or, if that sounds too hard, at the very least you'll want to pet a horse or hop on a hayride or something.

			 Look at all the teeny, tiny sneakers!!! Kylie Jenner recently took to Snapchat to document daughter Stormi's shoe collection, and let me say that it's extremely impressive for someone who can't even walk yet. Among the shelves of tiny bb kicks are designs by Fendi, Giuseppe Zanotti, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci. Meanwhile, the prized sneaks in my closet are a pair of trashed white Vans I can't bring myself to throw away.    "Stormi can finally fit into some of her sneakers," Kylie says in the video above. "Her dad gave her a bunch of vintage shoes, so I'm about to see if she likes shoes. Too cute."  The six-month-old's collection is estimated to be worth a staggering $22,000, and I've never wanted to trade places with a baby so badly.  We already know that Kylie Jenner has an amazing room filled floor-to-ceiling with designer handbags, so it makes sense that her daughter's designer footwear collection would be equally impressive.  If Stormi has a shoe closet that rivals Carrie Bradshaw's and a makeup line named after her just six months after being born, I can't wait to see what the one-year mark will bring.

			 There's a lot to unpack here, guys. My grandmother won't be seen without her clip-on earrings. Doesn't matter if she's swimming in an ocean, having an operation at the hospital (long story), or just hanging by herself at home. She maintains that she has always had long earlobes, doesn't like them, and wants to cover them up with big, glamorous jewelry, which, in turn, has made them even longer, according to her. Because of this, I've had a mild fear of wearing chunky jewelry on my ears for basically my whole life. Maybe because she was always wearing fabulous pieces while hiding those lobes, I've admired statement earrings forever. So, this year, I decided to tell my fear of heavy jewelry to eff off and went hard on all kinds of cute ones, long lobes be damned.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Guys, I'm so glad I made this choice—mostly because I immediately feel more polished and put together any time I wear cute statement earrings. Even if you're just wearing jeans and a T-shirt, somehow people think you actually tried when you pair them with big ole' hoops. Spoiler alert: All you really did was poke some posts through your ears and walk out the door! Whenever I wear a new, dramatic pair, everyone notices them, because you can't help it! They're huge! They're right by the face! They can't be missed! So, to recap: Statement earrings make you the mayor of Compliment City. Join me in my heavy earring epiphany, and shop the adorable statement looks below! Real quick, I feel like I do have to answer a few pressing questions that my grandmother's perspective on these do-dads bring up. That would be a "yeah."  My grandma was spot-on, unfortunately. If you wear statement earrings with real weight to them all the time, you can stretch your lobes, and you can also elongate the holes your earring backs poke into. The solve for this is to have a little variety in your jewelry box and switch up your style every day. You can also find dramatic pieces, like hoops, that are made from plastic over heavier metals so you can get the look without the dreaded pull effect. Yes! A few products exist that will help you even out the pull of gravity. Levears are oblong earring backs that help give your dangly pieces extra lift. Lobe Wonder Ear Support Patches are small adhesive ovals that strengthen and support your lobes while you wear chunky items and keep your hole a nice little circle rather than a slash through your ear. Apparently that's also a yes! Earrings (just like headbands or tight ponytails) can pull on connective tissue in the muscle groups around your scalp, which can mean headaches. If this happens to you often, it may be good to reserve your heaviest pieces for nights out, when you won't be wearing them for quite as long. Statement earrings are stunning, but let's leave room for a healthy amount of apprehension if you don't want your ears to hang low, wobble to and fro, etc., etc. Have a good mix of earring days vs. non-earring days, and lightweight pieces vs. heavier baubles. And if you've got some really pull-y pairs, reserve 'em for special events, when you know you won't be wearing them for that long. Oh, and I guess if you don't listen to any of that advice, you can just take a page from my Grammy's book and wear glamorous, lobe-covering clip-ons for the rest of your life. It's actually a pretty fabulous way to live.

			 Your soles will thank you.  Heels can, quite literally, elevate any outfit, but while they look stylish, they often times come at a price. I'm talking blisters, pinching, shooting pain, and in extreme cases, even sprains. Yeah, not very fun. (Of course, slip-on sneakers, flats, and walking sandals are going to be nicer to your feet, but sometimes an ensemble just calls for a fun pair of heels!) But raise your hand if you can relate: You finally do find high heels that you can stand in all day, but they look downright orthopedic—i.e., like something your grandma would wear. (Sorry, G-Ma!) While it can seem next to impossible to find a heel that's both chic AND comfy, they're definitely out there—even if it takes endless internet searching to stumble across 'em. Luckily for you, we've already done the work and compiled a list of the 21 most comfortable high heels in various silhouettes, textures, and heights, so you can find one that works with your style. Wave goodbye to achy, sore feet with these designs.  When a heel height exceeds three inches, consider a platform to help protect your ankles. This classic pair features a 1-inch platform, soft-backed velvet material, and cushioned sole.  You’ll look sophisticated while your feet comfortably rest in a pair of knotted slides. The low heel height is ideal for long days on your feet; plus, these'll look so cute with sheer socks in colder temps.  The soles of your feet will be so happy wearing these white-hot booties made with soft leather and a thicker block heel. One reviewer said they have a soft cushion, so you can wear these all day during the winter. (Bonus if you have warm socks to pair with 'em.)  With a covered toe and criss-cross straps, your feet will secure in these pumps without sliding around. They have a lightly-padded footbed; plus, the suede material is super soft.  With an easy slip-on style, these shoes are simple to get on—and keep on. Clog lovers on Amazon are obsessed with this top-rated pair that are comfortable to stand in hours on end.  In lower block heels, you’ll stand out all day without having to stand quite *so* tall. This type of heel is more sturdy than a stiletto, so you can wear them longer without sore feet. Also, metallics double as neutrals and go with almost every outfit you wear. A kitten heel is always a safe choice when it comes to finding shoes that aren’t painful. At just 1.6 inches, you won’t have to swap these out for sneakers after, like, 30 minutes of wear.  These bold croc-embossed platforms are perfect to take from day to night with the subtle texture and 4-inch heel. (The platform makes them feel lower than that, though!)  Get the cool aesthetic of a mule with the demure touch of a kitten heel. This one’s micro-height is so minimal, you might as well be wearing flats. This retro platform is great for a night out. Your ankles will be kept in place as you're dancing with the adjustable buckle and extra criss-cross straps around the toes.  A lower stiletto will give you just what you need for all-day wear height-wise, plus a lot of sartorial flair. The elastic ankle strap also curves around the back of your heel, so there's no pesky buckles digging in.  Everlane's shoes are known for their minimal, stylish aesthetic and rave reviews; these "Day Heels" have more than 4,000 reviews with a 4.39-star rating. (V specific, I know.) Customers are obsessed with the elastic back that hugs their feet and the perfectly-sized 2-inch heel.  A cute, flexible bootie featuring elastic gores is designed to work with the natural shape of your foot and calf—not the other way around. The snake-skin leather adds an extra touch of pizzazz. Experimenting with style doesn't have to come at the expense of comfort. Try testing out an architectural heel with a trendy two-tone color scheme, but keep it below three inches.  A loafer is a go-to style, and with the added block heel it adds just the right amount of height. It also features a lightly-padded insole, and a couple reviewers loved them so much they bought multiple pairs. These glitter boots are completely lined on the inside so they won’t irritate your ankles, and the stretchy knit material molds to your ankle and calf. The cushioned footbed is pretty great too, TBH.  A thick heel provides extra support, while a leather T-strap can be adjusted to the perfect size. The rounded point on this pair will prevent your toes from pinching, too.  Sarah Flint's pumps are some of the comfiest ever (Meghan Markle is a fan, JSYK) thanks to their arch support, expanded toe box, and extra footbed padding.  A low heel (this curved one is so cool?!) and slip-on silhouette makes this pair one you'll want to wear 24/7.  This boot is super on-trend and offers support if you're always on your feet. The modern cowboy design is mounted on a block heel with elastic paneling that makes it effortless to slip on.  These pointy sling backs are the perfect accessory to wear with a skirt at the office or a pair of jeans on the weekend. The padded insole and soft pebbled leather will save your feet, while the design is way chic.

			 It's called ~fashion~. Dressing in the winter can be quite difficult. There’s always wind, snow, or a bitter cold that feels like the wrath of Antarctica is coming your way. And forget it if you have to dress up to go somewhere, because you’re better off staying home — that is, until now. The Italian brand Moncler has created a cross between a puffer jacket and a gown. The Down-Quilted Long Puffer Dress is available at Barneys and comes in cobalt blue and pink. They’re sleeveless with a high neckline and hidden zipper in the back. If you had your heart set on actually becoming a proud owner of one of these babies, this might put a wrench in that plan — the dresses are $2,710. Oh fashion! Unfortunately, the $1,500 green gloves pictured above are out of stock. So if you see super rich people wearing a pair this winter, send them a compliment from me.   My first thought when I saw these dresses was about how insane they were. But the more I look, the more genius I find them. So if you think they’re ridiculous, just keep thinking about them and get back to me. Oh, and if you have to, try to find some on Amazon!

			 Perfect presents he’ll love.  Anniversaries are milestones that deserve to be celebrated. Here are 26 special gifts to help you express your love—bonus if you can both get some use out of these presents.  A durable weekender with tons of handy pockets is a thoughtful gift if he constantly travels—or if you’re planning a romantic getaway together (see #9).  Yes, he’s a beer aficionado, but has he ever tried to make his own? This kit includes all the essentials to brew his own IPA, including grain, hops, and yeast, and it also comes in five other types.  Experiences make the best gifts, especially if it’s something you both can enjoy together. He’ll be so excited if you surprise him with concert tickets, and even if it’s not the day of your anniversary, it’ll give him something to look forward to.  No shame if he’s into skincare! A night serum that gets rid of dullness, fine lines, and wrinkles is one he’ll love—especially when he can sleep with it on.  A modern frame for a throwback photo—buy these in a trio, and they’ll look beautiful arranged on an end table. Sandal season already here, so get him a pair of amazingly comfortable slides with soft mesh material. He can wear these at the pool and everywhere in between this summer.  A set of black and silver cufflinks with mother-of-pearl will make his dress shirts look so polished.  If he’s in need of some new shirts, a leaf-printed vacation one will become his new fave in the warmer months.   Speaking of vacations, how about booking an Airbnb in a romantic cottage (like this gorgeous one in Nashville!)? You’ll have the whole pad to yourselves; plus, it’ll be so fun exploring a new city together.  Who wouldn’t want a journal that details every little thing someone loves about you? For all those couples out there who like to be romantic through writing, this one’s for you. If he’s been searching for that perfect “everyday shoe” i.e., one that looks dressy and casual at the same time, then he’ll so appreciate a low-top leather pair.  A watch with a black face and a leather strap with that “worn-in” look will totally be up his alley. It’ll complement all his outfits and he won’t want to leave the house without it.  Get a map of the place where you first said “I love you” or “I do”—he’ll love the special meaning behind it. You can even add a quote underneath the starry constellation. If he’s secretly (or not-so-secretly) a wine-o he’ll definitely enjoy a statement decanter that’ll make any vintage that much smoother.  Sure, these brown sunnies stand out, but thanks to the classic marbled pattern they’ll look so effortless and cool on him.  For a couple always on-the-go, this carry-on suitcase can fit both your items for a quick weekend getaway. It also has a secure combination lock for extra protection. A gift that treats him and yourself at the same time is definitely one you’ll want to look into. A couples massage, facial, or aromatherapy session is the ultimate way to indulge yourselves on your special day.  Get him a super light, water-repellent jacket and he’ll wonder why he never wore a style like this before. This one provides insulation and has convenient zippered pockets so his things are secure.  Even if fragrances might not be his thing, one whiff of this, with its notes of sage and bergamot, will totally change his mind.  Whether he’s an avid record collector or has always wanted to get into vinyl, get him a retro suitcase turntable he can set up anywhere around the house.  If he loves stacking bracelets on his wrist or has always wanted a simple piece of jewelry, a braided leather wrap with a silver-accented closure is minimal, yet sharp.  Have too many adorable pics to count? Gather them up and put them all together in a photo album that you’ll both love to look back on throughout the years.  Yes, they’re an investment, but the noise-cancellation and wireless feature on these over-the-ear headphones are totally worth it. Plus, the leather material makes them super durable.   If he’s a big fan of skincare and beauty sleep (aren’t we all?), he’ll obsess over these cheeky pillow cases that come with a soothing night cream you both can slather on before hitting the sack.  If he’s been eyeing a new wallet for a while, now’s the perfect time to get him a sleek leather one that easily fits in his pocket.  Is he constantly on his feet? A pair of  “commuter” pants that he can wear to work but are comfy enough for travel will be so life-changing.

			 The email her coordinator sent around to her attendees is so shameless. Weddings can be stressful, but there's probably no excuse for an email guests received from a bride's coordinator telling them they wouldn't be admitted to the celebration without a gift of $75 or more, and letting them know they shouldn't wear a full face of makeup or try anything beyond a ponytail or "simple bob" for their day-of glam.  A little more backstory: On Thursday, a Redditor called Laika_cat posted a screengrab of a message she'd received listing a bunch of rules for confirmed attendees of an upcoming wedding. The title of the Reddit post was, "Kindly refrain from upstaging the bride on her big day—oh, and no admission without a gift of $75 or more." Let's just let it speak for itself, shall we: It starts off OK, aside from the slew of grammatical errors. But, you've been warned, after this person asks to confirm whether the guest is still planning to attend with a plus-one, it gets so much worse: This bride knows what she wants and what she wants is for you to NOT TALK TO HER. #Respect. Here's the screenshot: Needless to say, Redditors slammed the note's spelling errors. Some users even implied that the note wasn't even sent by a coordinator, but more likely by the bride herself or one of her bridesmaids. Probably while drunk. Others speculated that the RSVP list went way down after this email came through, but I would personally be at this wedding with bells on, hoping for a front-row seat to all the drama. Congrats, you two love-birds! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 You need to see this in its full glory.  Selena Gomez arrived at the Met Gala Red Carpet wearing her go-to designer, custom Coach 1941, but the internet very quickly reacted to a totally different part of her look. People had some... thoughts about the beauty element.  Let's break this down. There's the dress, with the longggg train. It's basically see-through on the bottom, and there's plenty of ruffle detailing to go around.  There are the glittery silver heels. Amazing.  There's the eye shadow, which is VERY gold. Very fun, very trendy.  And then there's... the tan. Some people were like "YASSS Selena looks amazing," and others were not quite so sold. The comments ranged from "She needs to fire her makeup artist" to "Stop taking tanning advice from Trump." Basically, the internet was divided. Here are more pics if you need the full context before firming up your opinion:    This tweet seems to sum it up:  selena gomez arriving at #MetGala pic.twitter.com/PB7f9dJlbC Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 She's wearing the most magical dress.  For the past couple of months, it seems like Kim Kardashian has only been wearing (kind of boring, there, I said it!) monochromatic athleisure ensembles or, you know, next to nothing at all. But on Thursday she took to Instagram to unveil an incredible and completely extra fashion moment that feels like an entirely new look for the reality star.  In the shot from a recent photoshoot, Kim's wearing a giant blush-colored dress with tiers (and tiers) of tulle and basically looking like a fairytale princess. Or a fashion-forward puffy cloud, you decide! But still, even with the ultra-feminine outfit, she couldn't ditch her on-trend tiny Matrix sunglasses.  The magical shoot is featured in ODDA Magazine's latest issue, for which Kim is one of its six cover stars. In the post on her Instagram, she revealed that she'll release more behind-the-scenes photos from the dreamy shoot on her app.  Still, though, her new princess-y vibe is a total déjà vu moment to this dress worn by Rihanna in October last year.    Here's hoping that giant, fluffy tulle dresses are the new fashion trend because doesn't everyone want to live out a glamorous princess moment? They can also be used to hide a lot of snacks... probably? Shop a similar look below.

			 Who won the red carpet on Hollywood's biggest night? Sorry, Timmy. I’m sure you thought you had this one in the bag, and at any other event, you might have taken it. But then along came decorated screenwriting legend James Ivory wearing a custom shirt with, well, YOU on it. (He adapted the film for which he and Chalamet were nominated, Call Me By Your Name.) The good news is, he said he’s going to give it to you tomorrow, so you can wear it next. By which we mean: You HAVE to wear it next. Please? We genuinely thought this was jewelry on Danai’s head for a second, but no, it’s silvery painted art. And it’s amazing. Danai Gurira is basically everything: She’s a stellar actress, a Tony-winning playwright, an activist, speaks four languages, and has played a zombie fighter (in The Walking Dead) and a Wakandan warrior. And she still found a way to surprise us. We’ve long suspected Allison Janney might be a sorceress, prone as she is to being awesome in every way and in pretty much every outfit. These divinely witchy sleeves are clear proof of this theory, right? We would greatly appreciate her spell book. (Let’s be honest: Even the Hogwarts staff is like, “How can we get a piece of THAT magic?”) Tiffany told reporters that her Eritrean father, who died this year, once told her that he knew she’d be at the Oscars someday and that she had to honor her heritage when she got there. This was a beautiful tribute both in emotion and in cloth; she looks spectacular in this traditional zuria. Her dad would have been so very proud, and... shoot, well, there goes our mascara. We have never really missed this singularly ’80s trend, but Lupita is making us rethink that by employing it in the singular. The lone shoulder is gorgeously draped — the ideal complement to the immaculate fit of the rest. Trust, we don’t regret that Viola wore a bra, we just wish the top of this dress weren’t designed to so clearly emulate one. The pink color is delightful, and the body-skimming shape and styling are so appealing... until the pseudo-underwire stitching pulls our focus. Great underpinnings can be the hero of a woman’s wardrobe; we just wish Kors kept them more under wraps. Allison showed up promptly — to a red carpet that began a full three hours before the telecast — and gave herself plenty of time to promenade. We wish she’d done it in something with more of a Best Dressed zest. She has interesting taste and in the past hasn’t shied away from showing it. Why choose this night to paint herself in beige? It’s called Get Out, Allison, not Wash Out. We love a cape; that’s no secret. And we love a pattern. But this gown has both those things, pockets, a contrasting checkered lining, AND the cape is attached at the boobs. If this actually were a drink, it would be called I Just Poured In Whatever Was Lying Around; Hope It Tastes Okay But It Will Definitely Get You Drunk. Whoopi does not have a long and storied history of classic ball gowns. She is, in fact, one of the few women who has actually worn a full wackadoo Thom Browne ensemble exactly as it was shown on the runway. So we love that she joined forces with Christian and got a lushly floral statement piece that retains her bold taste without careening off a cliff — and, indeed, on the red carpet, she revealed the skirt was hiding hiking boots. Respect, Whoopi. Listen, this dress is what would happen if Zac dropped acid inside a Laura Ashley store. Andra is doing her best with it, but that’s a LOT of heavy lifting...which may indeed explain why she full-on lay down on the red carpet and posed accordingly instead. And doesn’t it look 100 percent better that way? Lots of these stars are luminous, obviously, but we audibly gasped when Jennifer glided past the E! cameras. Has she ever looked better? And yes, we say that despite a neckline that gives the optical illusion that it has slid askew. We’ve decided she and Ben Affleck have a shared pool of hotness, and the weirder and worse he looks post-divorce, the stronger she becomes. You know the phrase “dripping with diamonds”? Sometimes, it’s advisable to turn off the faucet. It's unusual to see a brown formal gown — especially at the Oscars, where fewer women take that kind of a risk. This is one is so slouchy, yet so glam. Zendaya is only 21, but she could teach women three times her age a lesson in relaxed elegance. Dude, it rained a lot in Los Angeles over the last few days. Can you blame a girl for thinking she might need a built-in flotation device? Did anyone look cooler on the red carpet Sunday night? The answer is no. We have had some concerns about Emma Stone's new contract with Louis Vuitton — and this isn't assuaging them. While the blazer is maybe fine, the rest of it feels like someone forgot to pack her trousers and had to run out to H&M to pick up a replacement.  Emma is the out-going Best Actress. Now is not the time to appear half-assed. It's hard to believe that this glorious, glamorous gown came from the same source as Emma Stone's flaccid suit. This totally saves their grade. We were just wondering how Nicole, lauded as she’s been for Big Little Lies, would put a bow on this exceptional awards season. And then BOOM, there it was, smiling across her pelvis. So...she’s on theme, at least?   Rita Moreno wore this same gown in 1962, when she won best supporting actress for her role in West Side Story. We can't even fit into pants we bought last year. Chadwick Boseman: A king in Black Panther, king of the Oscars red carpet. America's figure-skating sweetheart is not going to go quietly into that good night. Your move, Johnny Weir. This gown's pattern and color are amazing, and she looks gorgeous in it; we just wish the neckline were a more shallow v, because once someone points out that she looks like she's wearing it backwards, that's all you'll be able to see. On Twitter, this gown was drawing comparisons to Michelle Williams's iconic yellow Vera Wang, and there can be no higher compliment. It's so relaxed, so cheerful, so easily elegant on her. This pale, delicate pink color works on Saoirse, but sadly the fit seems off; this gown just sort of hangs there, doing her no favors. The good news is, she didn’t win wearing this, and thus won’t have it committed too indelibly to her sartorial history. She’ll get another chance soon enough— on all counts.

			 And Mary-Kate is wearing black again. Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen grace the world with public appearances only a very few times a year, and thankfully, Met Gala is usually one of those occasions. Both have been attending the Gala since before it was cool, and every year they stun because that's simply what they do best. Here they are on the red carpet this year making their iconic no-teeth smiles (can you call it a smile, though? Idk.) Last year the sisters departed from their usually all-black ensembles, but Mary-Kate is back to her old ways with a black robe dress, which makes total sense because she's worn black to at least seven Met Galas at this point (2006, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and now, 2018).  Ashley, on the other hand, brought out the color in a gown that looks to me like silk, but what do I know? Both women accessorized with some really major necklaces, body jewelry, earrings, and headbands, and for hair they both stuck with their signature beach waves.  Just another reminder that these two are living, breathing style icons. That's all.

			 Yep, you heard that right. A closet overflowing with leggings is awesome—until, you know, you need something to wear to work that isn't of the spandex variety.  A well-rounded closet also needs a few structured pieces (for balance, of course)—and when it comes to chic and comfortable basics, Everlane is a go-to. Now, for Memorial Day weekend, Everlane's adding even more styles to their "Choose What You Pay" section. Yep, you heard that right. This special sale section gives you the power to select your own price, with discounts up to 45% off, on current-season styles. Go ahead and add your faves to your cart—but do it quick, the sizes are already dwindling. Throw this relaxed dark wash denim jacket over absolutely anything and you'll ooze cool. Bonus: The rigid Japanese fabric only gets better with wear. This collarless classic shirt is available in blue or grey stripe and white. It can double as a swim cover-up. This bright striped shirtdress includes a belt at the waist and has pockets. The lightweight pinpoint Oxford cloth also won't make you break a sweat on even the hottest days. Beat the summer heat with this split-back crop top in a brilliant bright blue. (And maybe spring for the matching blue skirt to match.) This super-soft tee feels like actual pj's. It's made of combed cotton that gets softer with every wash. This wrap dress is the perfect companion for summer getaways. It's made of wrinkle-resistant Japanese GoWeave fabric and below-the-knee skirt is flattering on everyone. These premium Japanese denim skinny jeans are made in an ethical factory (that mans fair wages, reasonable hours, and a nice environment for workers). Plus, they have just enough stretch for a sleek, flattering fit. This cropped hoodie is made of breathable French terry, so you can wear it through the summer. It also features a convenient kangaroo pocket in front.

			 *runs to find all the return labels I’ve ever received* My life: Buy clothes online, try them on, love some, hate some...but never send back the losers and stuff them deep into my closet instead. Yes, even if I can just slip them in the original package and drop that in the mailbox for free. I’m the worst. Anyone else? Yeah. Everyone else, it turns out. The average millennial keeps an average of three $40 items per year that we don’t actually like, according to a new Cosmo survey. That’s $120 of wasted cash that I personally could use to buy, IDK, concert tickets? My coffee for the next whole month? Add up all these bucks and we are collectively losing billions a year. Here’s why.   We’re spoiled by convenience. “There’s been an explosion of services that eliminate daily hassles from our lives—we can now have our groceries delivered, meals planned, and beauty subscriptions sent straight to our doors,” says Veronica Thomas, associate professor of marketing at Towson University. With each new app that makes life easier, we’re basically being conditioned to pay to live stress-free. So yeah, taping up a package and driving it to a UPS store just ain’t it. This is especially true for me if I end up having to shell out for any shipping costs. I’ll be out that $40 and happy bingeing my Netflix shows instead, thanks. Not sure about you, but I feel pretty busy. I’m running around trying to work to pay my bills, keep up basic standards of human hygiene, and make all my friends and family feel loved. TBH, I’m lucky if I squeeze in some self-care here and there—like, I don’t have a second to mail your shitty shirt back. I already used any spare time I had to read reviews beforehand.   $120. That’s how much each of us is wasting on clothes per year. It adds up! “There is something to be said for the fact that you’ve put in so much time up front,” says Thomas. “So when an item comes and doesn’t fit the way you hoped, you don’t want to put even more effort to return it.” Speaking of *all* those reviews we read, if we noticed a one-off red-flag comment and ignored it (because the other feedback was overwhelmingly positive), we might end up blaming ourselves for the meh purchase. “It’s kind of like, ‘Shame on me,’” says Thomas. After all, someone did say, 500 comments in, that the sleeves on this dress are stupid. Therefore, it’s not that surprising that when said dress arrives, the sleeves are dumb as hell. Also, when we hit “buy” on something like a pair of jeans online, we don’t even think about giving them a trial period. “The majority of consumers—66 percent, according to an NPR survey—buy something online thinking they’ll keep it,” says Thomas. “They’re making a purchase in good faith—in their minds, they already own it.” So, that hypothetical dress with the lame sleeves is permanently ours now, whether or not we actually love it IRL. News flash: Once we own something, we get possessive. This is called the endowment effect or attachment theory, according to Dora Bock, associate professor of marketing at Auburn University.   Even trippier, research suggests that we can “fall in love” with an item’s branding or how it looks on an online model—and still adore it even if it disappoints us when we finally try it on.  News flash: Once we own something, we get possessive. “We bought this product for a reason—we expect it to be perfect,” says Thomas. At that point, though, we’re in too deep. Uuugh. You know those coupon codes at the top of a shopping site that say “20SPRING” for 20 percent off spring clothes? Yeah, those are a mindfuck. “They change the emotional reaction a customer has to spending money,” says Bock. “You don’t feel guilty about your purchase anymore, you feel great. You’re smart, savvy—you have a code.” That feeling can carry through even if we end up not liking what we bought when it arrives. “And when you felt so good about your purchase like this, you’re less likely to return it,” says Bock. Short answer: Not really—but we are losing money. If we truly value bingeing true-crime shows above getting back $40 for a bralette that’ll sit in a drawer forevs, fine! Just don’t let these habits bust that bank account. We do return *some* things (about $400 billion worth in 2018, per the National Retail Federation). We’re just way less likely to get reimbursed for stuff purchased online versus in physical stores. Why? When we make a plan to return something to a brick-and-mortar shop, we’re probs doing so because we’ll be out and about anyway running errands. When we shop online, the expectation is that a cute top comes directly to our house, eliminating the need to ever change out of sweats and, you know, go somewhere. Don't let them languish in your closet. Slip them on a few months later. I've done this with items I thought I didn't like and ended up loving a dress I initially hated. Time heals all wounds? Clean out your closet every once in a while and give those duds to a good cause. Lots of local charities and organizations take clothing, and many of them especially like when the tags are attached. Even if you bought them a while ago, apps like Poshmark and Trench take new and gently used items from your favorite stores, like Zara, Urban Outfitters, and Madewell. ...throw them away. Your discarded pieces release toxic gases as they break down and combine with garbage in landfills—and that pretty much sucks for everyone.

			 Amazon reviewers are OBSESSED with it. If you are one of the many people who aren’t crazy about the cold, navigating your way through the winter season with a smile on your face can be pretty tricky. Despite the abundance of super huge and padded winter coats, some of us still find ourselves walking around with the chills, and let’s be honest: it’s really not that fun.  However, there is a heated apparel company (yes, you read that correctly) called Ororo offering vests, coats, fleeces, and even sweatshirts with rechargeable battery heating devices  — promising to keep you warm even under sub-arctic weather conditions. We are so on-board. The company, based in the Midwest, wanted to create an all-season apparel line with the intention that you can wear them during fall and winter without using the heating option, but when temperatures drop their heating technology will keep you toasty. Most items offer heating in multiple areas of the body with four different heating levels, and each battery charge promises up to 8 hours of wear.  The collection is available on Amazon, with all items retailing for under $170. The most popular item on the online retailer is their Women’s Slim Fit Heated Jacket, which has amassed a near-perfect score from reviewers. Many reviewers explain that the wind and water resistant jacket is a great alternative to wearing tons of layers, and love the variety of temperature options, as they can adjust the warmth level depending on the chill factor. Some of the reviewers attest to the fact it kept them warm in the coldest of climates — even during the middle of winter in Chicago.  And did we mention that the clothes are actually super cute?

			 There’s a sexy outfit for everything. Seriously.   Okay, so if you're not into pun, scary, group, or food costumes…that’s totally fine! Halloween is the one night you can be whoever you wanna be—even if who you want to be is a sexy astronaut. The sheer amount of costumes that are deemed “sexy” online—this White Claw one is proof—is basically limitless. It’s safe to say that even the most mundane one can look hot, so if sexy’s what you’re going for, here are 25 costumes you’ll want for Halloween night.  Peace, love, and more candy. A tie-dye bra top, fringed vest, and flower details will make you look like you were at Woodstock. #TBT, right?  You’re a wizard, Harry—a sexy one, anyway. Suspenders over a bandeau, fishnets, thigh-high black boots, a tie, and round glasses will do just the trick for this costume. Don’t forget about the lightning scar!  Put me in, coach! Be the sexiest short stop in the baseball biz with a jersey mini dress, knee-high socks, and white sneaks.  As if! Channel Cher Horowitz in a cropped vest, plaid skirt set, and calf-high white socks.  Look outta-this-world amazing in a metallic space bodysuit and pile on glitter makeup and blue lipstick for an intergalactic effect.  A blue-and-white gingham pinafore is synonymous with no other movie character. Put your hair in pigtails, carry a basket for Toto, and don’t forget your red ruby heels! Get your girls together and become a literal squad with a classic cheerleading costume. Go! Fight! Win!  Not all superheroes wear capes. Wonder Woman prefers to stick to her gold cuffs, headband, and patriotic bodysuit, thank you very much.  Like Edward Cullen, but wayyy sexier. A bright red lip is the final touch to this vampire look.  Alexa play “Circus” by Britney Spears. But seriously, you’ll look like you run the whole thing with a top hat, fishnets, and buttoned bodysuit.  Vivian from Pretty Woman is a classic movie character. If you don’t get this costume featuring a bodycon dress, beret, and over-the-knee boots, consider it a “Big mistake! Huge!”  This sexy scout costume features a white top, sash, khaki shorts, necktie, and matching hat. Sadly, cookies are not included. A sexy twist on a historical black-and-white maid costume. It even comes with a lil feather duster! It’s okay to be a little devilish on Halloween. A sparkly bodysuit, red heels, and, of course, those signature horns definitely make a statement.  Toy Story just got a whole lot sexier thanks to these short-shorts, cow-printed leggings, and button-down shirt.  Opt for this iconic storybook costume with a red bustier dress and hooded cape. Just be careful of any wolves!   Ariel would approve of this sheer costume with mesh panels and green scales. Yes, you can even be a sexy animal! The world is your oyster! Channel Bambi with a brown mini dress and antler-adorned hood.   Be your most sexy, nautical self with a blue-and-white dress, fishnets, and a sailor hat.  If you love yourself a good joke, then a sexy court jester costume is for ya. Coordinate with two-toned lipstick too.   You’ve always wanted to wear wings, let's be honest. Feathered ones with a white lacy teddy and thigh-high socks give off those angelic vibes.   You’ll bring extra *hotness* to any Halloween party with this get up.  “Daddy's Lil Monster” is officially ready for Halloween night. Wear this red and blue costume featuring a crop top, shorts, bomber jacket, and pigtail wig to be this recognizable villain.  Roll up to the Halloween party like, “Ahoy!” with this old-fashioned pirate costume—huge hat, frilly sleeves, and all.   3,2,1, GO! Look like you came straight from the racing track in a one-piece with black-and-white checkered details and a coordinating flag.

			 Need this whole look in my closet NOW.  On Monday, Kylie Jenner donned a super form-fitting leather dress featuring a halter neck, accessorizing with a teeny-tiny black Chanel bag—and her newly filler-free lips.  She posed outdoors with her Insta-famous BFF, Anastasia Karanikolaou, better known as @stassiebaby, before heading off to a finale screening of The Handmaid's Tale at The Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles.  
  Cast members Amanda Brugel and Yvonne Strahovski's ensembles  totally coordinated with Kylie's, and I'm really hoping they hung out all night to discuss Season 3 and if June ever will GTFO of Gilead. Celebrities—they binge-watch Hulu shows just like us!  But back to the outfit. Kylie wore a pair of black strappy heels that matched her dress, adding gold bracelets and a watch to complete the lewk—and damn, does she look good. As mom Kris Jenner would say, "You're doing amazing, sweetie!"   Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Or at the very least, breathe air out of his nose real fast.  Picking out the *perfect* present for your boyfriend, dad, friend, or coworker can seem like an impossible task. What do they want? What do they like? What are they actually going to use?! There are so many questions to figure out, but you also don’t want to go the easy route with a gift card. I feel ya. Instead of putting tons of pressure on yourself, try getting something low-key that will make him laugh. A silly, not-too-serious gift is always a good idea and makes the shopping process way less stressful. Here, 30 funny gift ideas for men that’ll definitely earn a laugh—or at least a slight chuckle.  This body wash definitely helps “keep the funk off his junk.” But once you get past the straightforward name, it’s actually a pleasant combination of essential oils, plant extracts, and activated charcoal that gives a deep clean and fresh smell. This cool LED motion-activated bowl light automatically turns on when you approach. No more feeling around in the dark for the light switch! Give him everything he needs to make his favorite cocktail on any flight. (This also comes in two other kits if he’s not into Moscow mules, FYI.) Each day on this calendar has a hilarious one-liner from a different comedian so he can wake up every morning with a smile on his face—and get inspired to make his own clever jokes. This book is the perfect gift for all the dads out there who think they’re comedians. A sequin pillow that reveals a very close-up look of Nicolas Cage’s face will definitely be the highlight of his holiday season.  If he jokes about how his locks are lookin’ patchy, a hair-loss kit is a funny gift that might actually do his thinning strands some good.  A mini old-school globe he can put by his desk or on his dresser is a cute, quirky present where he can also pick out any new countries to visit. Whether he wears boxers every day or just to sleep in, he’ll appreciate these fun ’za-print ones. A sling bag will keep all his valuables close and make him the coolest person on the block with those ~streetwear vibes~.   Nothing beats the smell of a new car. Since you’re not buying him one, though (lol), give him this freshener that will give his current ride that same addicting scent. If he likes to reply to your texts with emoji, give him these bright thumbs-up socks. Soap on the rope is just as silly as it is practical. No more slippery bars falling out of his hand or dissolving away in a watery dish! If he’s always misplacing his keys, get him a colorful key fob that makes them easier to spot. He’ll be sure to love the classic needlepoint car. Who wouldn’t love a goose wearing Nike sneaks giving a thumbs up? A silly T-shirt he can wear around the house is a low-key present, but the image will definitely make him smile. People go to desperate lengths to protect their Ben & Jerry’s pint, and a combination lock that keeps other people out is the perfect solution. He can simply pop these in the freezer and enjoy them with his favorite beverage. One that’s preferably “on the rocks.” Give him the gift of getting hip with these slang flashcards! I mean, who even knows what the youths are saying nowadays? This backpack discreetly holds two bottles of wine (or any beverage) that dispense from a removable, easy-to-use BPA-free party pouch. This kit contains all his “zombie” survival needs. It includes food, water, lighting, warmth, fire aid, and tools—but you hope he’ll never have to use it. This matte-black flask with a funnel attachment is the perfect size for toting around. Plus, it’s waterproof. This dog-appreciation mug is a daily reminder that he’s one of the good ones. All he has to do is simply open the package, slide his feet in, and get to steppin’ (and moppin’)! Give him this ultra-comfortable camo pajama onesie! He may laugh, but you know he’ll enjoy wearing it. If he loves sharing pics of his family or glory days in college, give him a tie that puts those memories on display. Any brew fanatic would appreciate a bag of jelly beans (albeit alcohol-free) in his favorite hoppy flavor. The best spray to eliminate any, um, odors that he may need to cover up. Whether you’re in a relationship with him or not, it’s always fun to give a pair of cuff links that has a picture of your beaming face in each. This pair can fit any tiny photo in ’em for comedic effect. If he’s messy with shells, a pedestal like this one could help him get more organized. The only thing better than a s’mores stick that looks like a fishing pole is one that can roast hot dogs too. Just trust me.

			 Macra-me, macra-you. You've seen it, and you know you love it. The very '70s trend of crochet is here—first spotted all over the runways and now populating your favorite stores. But...it's kinda see-through? So, how do you wear it?! A few ways, actually! A lot of models on the runways just brazenly went. for. it. and wore nothing beneath it. I'm all here for you if you want to do this, but many of us are not this bold. In that case, you can look for options with crochet details—like cutouts or peek-a-boo hems to dip your toes into this lewk. There are also tightly knit crochet options that are less sheer. Please see below.  If you wanna hop all the way in, consider wearing it on top of other dresses (like this model) or over shirts and swimsuits. Macrame coverups are actually the cutest, don't you agree?    And as always, if you love something, but you're on the fence about how you feel about wearing it completely, consider accessorizing with it. Okay, you ready to join the summer of knits in 2019???

			 This isn't what you wear to get your smoothies?  Kylie Jenner is nothing if not the most extra human on the planet. Remember that one time she took her daughter Stormi for a walk in head-to-toe Fendi? Or last week when she threw one of the most elaborate Barbie birthday parties? Well, she may have just one-upped herself with her latest set of 'grams.  The outfit in and of itself is nothing crazy by Kardashian/Jenner standards, but in the very last picture she notes that she is taking "La Ferrari" to "Jamba Juice" in this outfit. JAMBA JUICE. TO GET A SMOOTHIE.  Please scroll through on this next one because you need to see both pics.  If I had as much money as Kylie did I would maybe also get dressed in something like this with full hair and makeup and take my very expensive car out for smoothies, but like, DAMN GIRL.  She accessorized her white cutout bodysuit with some dad sneakers and a butterfly choker.  Kylie's blonde hair is new as of her birthday last week. People thought it was a wig but she replied to one commenter on Instagram and said it was real. Looks like she's really taking this Barbie thing *very* seriously.  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 We're all taking a walk on the wild side, apparently. In case you haven't caught on yet, animal print is a big deal. First, it was all over the runways, and now it's infiltrating every fashion e-commerce site. This, my friends, is a G-O-O-D thing. 
  What's so great about it is that, though it is attention grabbing, what with all the spots and stripes, it's actually a neutral, meaning you can wear it with everything. AMAZING.  This is not a one-print show—though leopard is great, it's not the *only* one out there. Zebra and tiger stripes are out there, for one. Snake- and giraffe-print are, too. Get creative, people! One more thing: Animal print here doesn't mean animal skin. It literally means a fabric that's been printed, painted, or embroidered to look like the cool textures and patterns you see in nature, so don't get that twisted. Let's start in a subtle place.  Now that you're accustomed, we can get a bit more fierce.  But, although those spots are obviously great, they're not the only cool thing out there.  And now... Also, just FYI, if you looooooove this trend, you might, like, want it in your home and everywhere else too? Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 + Hailey Bieber’s pick for the season. You’re welcome! Summer temps may be peaking outside, but here at Cosmo we’re already starting to plan our *lewks* for fall. While a cooler season means setting aside our beloved denim cut-offs and open-toed sandals, it also means welcoming in a whole new crop of trends.  To distract ourselves from the scorching heat, we've rounded up the ten essential items our fall wardrobes desperately need. (Hailey Bieber's favorite new handbag included!) So crank up that A/C and cool down with our latest list of must-haves ahead. We're pretty sure that if it's on Hailey Bieber's shopping list, it's going to be a thing. We got you. The model (and face of Charles & Keith’s new campaign) picked this itsy bitsy teenie weenie pink croc-effect bag as her top fall accessory.  If this summer was any indication, the animal print slip skirt has some serious staying power. While leopard and cheetah prints dominated the last few seasons, now there’s a new cat ready to pounce. Prepare to see tiger prints all up in your fashion feed, and grab this beauty now before it's too late! Rock and roll details were rife on the fall/winter 2019 runways. Channel that same spirit with grunge-inspired footwear like this black and white tassel bootie. Statement sleeves lend an ultra girly vibe to sweaters this fall, and we are here for it. Be it a puff-sleeve or larger-than-life shoulder detailing, expect your knits to get a sweet upgrade. We’re not quite prepared to give up every summer trend. Our love for mules continues into the new season with this super cute houndstooth style that’s perfect for both work and play. Say see ya to oversized blazers; it’s time to suit up (literally) in a cinched-waist style. Belted outerwear, from jackets to cardigans, made a splashy appearance this past fashion week. We’re gearing up to introduce the blazer iteration into our wardrobes stat. Functional, but make it fashion. We’re not ditching our baby bags just yet, but the need for practicality does tend to strike when the weather cools down. Revisit a chic and functional bag this fall with a top handle style that can hold *all* your essentials. (Peep Mrs. Bieber rocking this bad boy in the campaign image above!) Meet your new favorite jean trend. Thanks to nostalgic '90s vibes, the straight leg jean is making a fresh comeback. Look for full-length styles that hit below the ankle for an easy fit and suuuper flattering silhouette. Remember neon green, the color seen ‘round the world? Meet its pastel counterpart. Pistachio, sea foam, sage—whatever you want to call it, you can trust this minty iteration of the green color trend will be everywhere come fall. Tie-dye quickly became the trend to watch this year, and it's not going away as we enter into the new season. While we may associate it with our summer camp days, the print is transcending its warm weather association. Instead of co-ord short sets and pastel slip dresses, fall’s tie-dyes are manifesting in the form of long-sleeve layers and bold knits.

			 I don’t go anywhere without these bad boys. Summer is officially over, which means the only thing more necessary than sipping on something pumpkin-spiced rn is getting your hands on a pair of booties to kick off the season. No closet staple is better suited for fall than a modestly heeled slip-on that will help you conquer those leaf-infested streets without compromising on style. If you haven’t stocked up on this essential yet, let me stop you right there because—much like Bubba Sparxxx circa 2006—I found some new booties so good, they’re deserving of their own song. Or in this case, their own article. Oh, they’re these: I discovered this pair of Dolce Vita boots after digging myself deep into an e-commerce hole on Amazon, and since they’ve arrived, they’ve been upgrading my wardrobe (and honestly, my life). Here’s everything you need to know about them. If you’re the kind of person who’s always rushing out the door no matter how early you set the alarm (hello, have we met?), you totally understand that panicked moment of frustration when a complicated clasp or tangled lace gets in the way of your timely departure. These kicks were made for the likes of us, sliding on and off seamlessly, no zippers or ties required.  Mastering a Western-chic vibe requires skill, and these metal-tip shoes help me do just that while amping up the glam with a touch of snakeskin. Considering the fact that the print is so in demand among the sartorial set, I know I can count on these boots to earn me major fashion points no matter how I style them.   Things are finally heating up A post shared by  Dolce Vita Shoes (@dolcevita) on Feb 5, 2019 at 10:16am PST On the topic of styling these bad boys, I’ve become more compelled to take risks with each wear (and that’s a lot of wears, trust me). Maybe it’s because they’re so cool on their own and that makes me want to raise my own bar? Either way, at the beginning, I kept it simple by partnering them with straight-leg jeans and chunky knits. But when I started experimenting with different outfit combos, the contrast of a strong boot against more delicate dresses and ruffled pieces really started to grow on me. I’m now inspired to get even more creative and I’m fully leaning into this urban cowgirl situation. Who knew I’d owe so much to a pair of shoes? With a low heel and lots of give, these booties last me from day to night and from one season to the next without their form (or my toes!) getting ruined. They’re a more elevated, heeled alternative than your classic white sneaker, so you can be super comfortable without being too casual no matter where you’re headed. Okay, so I’m not calling these booties a steal or anything, but I like the fact that they’re made from calfskin leather while costing me less than what I’d pay at Everlane or Nordstrom. Plus, I’ve worn them so often over the past few months that I can confidently say this purchase was well worth the $175.  For anyone who is transitioning their wardrobe into fall and wants to take risks in the process, don’t think twice about adding these embossed booties to your cart. Their unique detailing and standout silhouette will carry you stylishly into the new season while earning you a number of admiring looks along the way.

			 Let me introduce you to the bathing suit I actually *love* wearing. I can remember the exact moment I gave up on finding a good bathing suit: My BFF Kiera planned a trip to the Jersey Shore for her Sweet 16, and there was no way I was wearing my usual one-piece. I spent hours at the mall with my mom looking the perfect bikini. Did I find it? Nope. Instead, I left with a Jamba Juice smoothie and a black tankini that was fine but definitely not the best. My annual swimsuit search has basically gone the same ever since.  That is, until Instagram served me some serious Summersalt ads.    🍊 you glad it’s Friday? 👈 see what we did there? #GoSummersalt pc: @jacimariesmith A post shared by  summersalt (@summersalt) on Feb 15, 2019 at 8:13am PST  The direct-to-consumer brand sells pajamas, underwear, and travel wear, but the swimwear was what really caught my attention. Not only were the suits super cute, but commenters said they were also comfortable as hell.  I figured it couldn’t hurt to try them out, so I ordered the leopard bikini and a little black one-piece. When they arrived, I immediately noticed how *soft* the material was. It felt more like comfy loungewear than the scratchy nylon-and-spandex blend most of my bikinis are made of. Sorry to every other item in my closet, but I’m only wearing Summersalt between May and September. Here’s why I’m obsessed: The brand offers more than 40 one- and two-piece styles, including high-waisted, cheeky, mesh cutouts, and super-plunge, and that’s before you even break it down by color. Most suits come in at least five shades, and there are also color-blocking and leopard-print options, making it super easy to mix and match. I get that this many choices can be overwhelming, so I used the brand’s Style Quiz to nail down my best options. The quiz uses 1.5 million body measurements from more than 10,000 women to help you find your perfect fit. When I said I preferred a little more nipple coverage, it filtered out cupless options. Genius. I know, I know—ordering swimwear online is risky. Which is why Summersalt’s At-Home Try-On is legit the best. The service allows you to try on up to four suits for six days before deciding if you want to commit to them. You have to pay a $15 concierge fee, but you’ll get your money back when you return the suits. Or if you prefer, Summersalt will waive the fee altogether if you team up with three friends for the service. The only downside to the At-Home Try-On is that it’s invite-only, and you need a special access code, but we gotchu: Use the code “COSMO” to try out four suits today. Sure, these aren’t as inexpensive as some of the $20 bikini options out there, but because Summersalt is a direct-to-consumer brand, it won’t charge a huge markup like quality bathing suits from other stores.   On top of that, the company claims that its fabric is five times more durable than traditional swimwear material and has built-in UPF 50+ protection, meaning it’ll hold up well through long days in the sun.  Summersalt is responsible when it comes to being Earth-friendly. The company uses recycled materials on both the fabrics and product packaging.  It’s 2019, and we all deserve a ’grammable bathing suit that’s comfy and fits well—and Summersalt gets that. Plus, the fact that you can try out multiple styles before you buy anything means there’s literally no risk in giving them a chance. But be warned: Once you try them on, it’ll be nearly impossible to send anything back.

			 We aren't sure how to feel about these. We understand: As cold weather approaches, it can be tough to finally admit it's time to pack up your favorite pair of flip flops for the season.

These hand-knitted bad boys, available all over Etsy, are specifically designed to wear with flip flops, with an open heel and toe.

			 Wave byeee to your blue denim.     Fall is basically the start of black-jeans season. It seems like an unwritten rule that once the weather starts to get colder, you start breaking out all your dark denim, right? And by the way, black styles go with just as many things as blue ones do, ranging from edgy and casual to dressy and chic, so you can style them in tons of different ways. (Another note: Even when they’re kinda dirty, no one knows! Just sayin’.) Here, 15 black-jeans outfit ideas you can wear—and shop!—right now.  Contrast your distressed black denim by making the rest of your look polished and pulled-together. A chic coat and structured bag’ll do the trick.    Pearls will elevate your everyday black jeans into something really special. These kinds of jeans are perfect for when you want to keep things simple because the details are the focal point here.    Want to add some fun to an otherwise simple pair of black jeans? Go with a style that has a slight split up the middle, seen here. Keep it casual with a graphic tee and “naked sandals” for an everyday look.    If you have gorgeous fall boots that you want to show off, this style is an excellent way to highlight them. Pair them with a cropped sweater and statement sunnies to turn heads.    This throwback ’80s silhouette is slightly baggy so it may not be everyone’s taste, but with the right top, outerwear, and accessories, it can actually look super elevated.    Black jeans are inherently a little edgier, but if you want to go all out, try a pair that has a side zipper. Lean even more into the all-black thing with a patent leather jacket, turtleneck, beret, and lace-up shoes.     Opt for these jeans if you don’t want to go too skinny or too wide. They look especially stylish if they’re high-waisted and paired with a patterned turtleneck and boots, seen here.    A simple pair can look fancy as hell, thanks to an oversize metallic blazer, bandeau, and peep-toe heels.     Wide-leg black jeans with a heavily frayed edge look on-trend when worn with a “grandmillennial” button-up cardigan and frame bag.    Show off your (sky) high-waisted jeans by tucking in your T-shirt. Keep the rest of the ’fit low-key with Converse and a crossbody.    Transition your go-to black jeans from the weekend to the office with a polished plaid blazer, red mules, and a fashionable purse.    The more pockets, the better! Workwear pants are definitely having a moment, but instead of going with an army-green hue, opt for a pair like this with contrast white stitching. Complete the streetwear vibe with a hoodie and sneaks.    Don’t want to go with a true black wash? Choose a slightly lighter charcoal shade, and offset the vibe with a pretty white blouse, mules, and top-handle.    Add more bling to your jeans by showing off your fly. Seriously. Then add a cape, printed top, hatband, and pumps to make it ultra sophisticated.    You can never go wrong with a classic mid-rise black jean in your wardrobe. Show a little skin by wearing with an open shacket (shirt-jacket hybrid) and a bralette underneath. Or button up the top if you’re feeling more modest.

			 This is my go-to heel. I'm going to get right to the point: I love these neutral, low block-heels, available on Amazon by a no-name company, So. Much. Here's why: They're simple, they're COMFORTABLE, and, even though they're just $43, they've lasted a little over a year with minimal wear and tear. That's a damn good shoe:   One day, after looking all around for a beige, low-heeled sandal on all my usual sites, and not finding annnnnything that matched what I needed, I decided to take my search-skills to Amazon and these babies were on the second page of results. They had good reviews and the perfect heel height for clumsy ol' me: 2 inches.  I'm glad I found them, too, because the style is sophisticated enough to pair with a black-tie gown, if you need, but chill enough to throw on with jeans and a button-down, too. Seriously, I wear this shoe to work, at formal dinners, and on vacation. You can see evidence of this all over my Instagram, FYI.   ...10,387 pictures later. 📸: @megawillz, aka my new iPhone accessory A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Nov 29, 2017 at 7:06am PST  Found a textured wall, so naturally... A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on May 5, 2018 at 9:20am PDT  It was windy. 🐨: @megawillz A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Jun 7, 2018 at 2:41pm PDT The strap on the toe isn't overly tight, and the buckle hasn't gotten all janky and crinkled-out over time, like some other affordable shoes I've gotten in the past. They've also made it through numerous 5-hour wedding dance marathons without hurting my feet AT ALL, and have also survived rain-soaked jogs to the subway, and mile-long walks on sandy beaches—all without making my dogs bark. The takeaway: Honestly, buying shoes on Amazon can be a bit of a risk—I've definitely purchased some that have looked SUPER cheap, or broken almost immediately. This pair is not like that! And the price tag is a hell of a lot better than similar designer styles that retailing $600 or more.  You know what? The shoes also come in tons of other colors, so, like, get to shoppin'! What are you waiting for??  Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 *Adds to cart*  How are you doing with that “exercise more” New Year’s resolution? Thought so. While great workout gear might not be a cure-all to get you into the gym, a good pair of workout leggings can bump your motivation. There’s a new pair of leggings on the block that Amazon users can’t stop talking about—and they’re only $11. 
  These high-waisted leggings by Leggings Depot are not only insanely affordable, but they’re also well-loved by Amazon reviewers. They boast a whopping 7.6k five-star reviews, and users are obsessing over their “incredibly soft and stretchy” fit. Thousands agree these are “buttery soft, warm, and not see-through!” One reviewer swears: “They aren’t messing around with the high waist capabilities; they come up above the smallest part of my waist when pulled up all the way, which I love.” The smoothing waistband means that these leggings will stay put exactly where you want them, so you can wear them to yoga class or even pair with a cute sweater during the day.  Sick of show-through on your favorite leggings? Don’t worry: “They are not see-through at all,” says one buyer, and many reviewers agree they’re totally opaque across sizes, which range from small-5X. No wonder they rank as some of the most popular Women’s Leggings on Amazon. Cute leggings for $11? I don’t know about you, but I’m sold.

			 Yeah, you need it too. Like the inevitable fate of a great tan, memories of this past summer are already starting to fade. But even as the season slips away, there’s one part of it I’m going to hold on to well into the fall, and you may have to rip it from my cold, dead hands, honestly: my straw tote.   Straw bags aren't just for the beach! 🌼👜 Pair them with a white jean and button-down shirt like @saramkessler for a polished weekend look. We're sharing a few of our favorite crafty-chic summer bags at the link in our bio. A post shared by  Amazon Fashion (@amazonfashion) on May 2, 2019 at 5:46pm PDT Since the Cult Gaia purse phenomenon of 2018, our social feeds have been flooded with various breeds of picnic basket/woven straw styles, and they’re still everywhere. After spotting the trend on the elbow nooks of beachgoers and farmers market fans alike, I couldn’t help but add this half-circle woven handbag to my cart after spotting it on Instagram. And I’ve been using it just as frequently during the fall as I did all summer long. Also, I’ll definitely be needing to take a few vacations, you know, just to show it off. Right?  For $25.99, you should probably get one too. Here’s why (you know, apart from the vacation aspect):   Tie a patterned scarf around the handle and bring this bag to brunch, the market, the park, or any other outing that requires a casual-but-cute kind of outfit. Its neutral shade complements everything from denim on denim to bright florals, and while I might’ve purchased it with the beach in mind, I’ve ended up using it for so much more.  This bag is lined with a bundle pocket that closes with a drawstring so you can keep your belongings in and everything else out—so clutch. Extra points for the fact that its durable straw exterior doesn’t damage easily.  It’s just the right size to fit the essentials and then some, including a book, some beauty products, and whatever other little thing is worth carrying. Also, this is a tangent, but it’s actually as natural as it looks. It’s handwoven from 100 percent yellow grass for an authentic, bohemian-chic feel.   Don’t be surprised if a stranger—or five—approaches you for details about where they can get one for themselves. When you tell them your secret style weapon is less than $30, they’re blown away. If you’re into all things stylish and straw, don’t wait until next summer to scoop this baby up. It’s definitely worth what you pay for it, especially when you start raking in the “Ooh, where’d you get that bag?” comments. One quick thing to keep in mind: Despite its convenient lining, this is not the most practical choice when you’ve got a lot of stuff to carry. Like all top-handle bags that don’t come with a removable strap, you might get frustrated if it gets too heavy and you can’t sling it over your shoulder. That being said, if you want to tap into this ever-popular trend, this affordable option is probably the easiest way to start!

Worried about the shoes getting scuffed up? Superga notes that its Cotu styles (aka this one) can be easily washed if you throw them in a pillowcase and wash them on cool with powder detergent and leave them out to air-dry. Problem solved.

			 They're like bracelets that tell time! Whether you can't leave the house without a watch or just want to be on time for once, here are 12 timepiece brands you should definitely consider.  A Danish-inspired brand, Skagen boasts countless designs that have a modern and minimal aesthetic, such as this two-toned gold and silver mesh one.  Odds are you've seen these watches pop up on Kylie Jenner or Lili Reinhart on Instagram. The brand is known for its simplistic but chic mesh bands with gold accents, however it does offer leather and canvas straps as well.  Fossil is known for its quality leather goods and the same is true when it comes to its watches, although it also offers mesh and silicone straps among more. Whether you're buying for yourself or as a gift, you have the option to engrave certain pieces to add a personal touch as well.  Want a classic design that's not super pricey? Look no further than Timex. The historical brand (it was created in 1854!) has timeless styles, but gives you the option to customize your perfect watch as well.  Olivia Burton watches are almost like an extension of its jewelry line because they're decorative as well. The watch faces are utilized in unexpected ways—just take this three-dimensional daisy one, for example. If you're looking for an ultra feminine style with a marble, floral, or patterned design, this is the brand for you.  If you're into digital styles, a Casio is the way to go. Sure, you might associate the brand with the scientific calculator you used in school, but the retro vibe of its core styles will get all the compliments. This silver design has a stopwatch function, an alarm, and is water resistant, too.  Don't like when there's too much happening on your watch face? Enter Nacre. The brand offers extremely minimal designs with metal accents in gold, rose gold, silver, and black, and you can also build your own design if there's a specific style you're going for.  The Los Angeles-based brand offers chic watches in a wide array of materials, colors, and faces all with its simple triangular logo. Its trendy marble styles, like pictured here, definitely stand out, but it also features more traditional ones with minute and hour markers.  Offering elegant, chic watches at an affordable price, Washington Square Watches features New York City's iconic arch on each face. It has both round and square styles, and if you like a little extra sparkle, you can opt for a watch with mother of pearl or crystals on the face.  If you love stacking pieces on your wrist, Rosefield offers trendy watches as well as jewelry so you can get that layered bracelet look. The brand's designs include mesh, leather, and embroidered straps (which are also interchangeable), and both round and square faces.  Breda, which launched in 2009 out of Dallas, Texas, has a wide range of durable watches that will hold up with everyday wear. The stainless steel metal adds a modern aesthetic to each style and they're also water resistant.  If you're willing to splurge on an investment piece, be sure to consider this Detroit-based company. The handcrafted pieces have an elegant look mixed with an Americana aesthetic and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. You'll definitely find one you love that will last a lifetime—the brand guarantees it.

			 Obsessed with how soft #5 is. You can never have too many white T-shirts. Browse this list to find your next go-to summer tee, from the cutest crop top to the softest slouchy style. Nothing says "It's finally warm outside!" like a boho knit top with a cute square neckline. Wear this one with light-wash denim shorts or a floral skirt if you're going for ~vacay vibes~.  A simple white crop top is a summertime staple because it literally goes with anything. Edge it up with back distressed shorts and a hat, or opt to go more causal. So many options!  The American flag on a classic short-sleeve "California" tee equals perfect for Independence Day. A tight, shoulder-baring piece will lend a sexy and sleek edge to any outfit. Re/Done Tees are soft and versatile, but this pop-art one will really make you stand out. Also, it's a no-brainer if you're obsessed with pizza.  Just looking for a classic piece you can wear all summer long? Found one for ya. A simple white tee looks a little less, well, simple, when it has a handy pocket on the front. Pair it with a raw-hemmed denim mini for a look that's low-key.  Breezy and soft, a slouchy, longer shirt is literally perfect for anything this summer, from sleepovers to nights out on the town. Nothing is sexier than a semi-sheer white shirt paired with a lacy bra that subtly peeks out. Just saying. Scalloped edges and lacy trim give this ribbed shirt a delicate touch. What's more comfortable than a dress made of T-shirt material? The seam at the back of this one makes it a tad more stylish than a plainer option. A top with a spliced neckline and and breezy silhouette can easily be dressed up or down. But, I gotta say, it looks pretty dang amazing with a bright yellow embroidered skirt.  Ribbed texture and longer sleeves lend an otherwise classic top a vintage flair. OK, I know this is supposed to be about plain white tees, but everyone needs a good striped shirt in the summer, and the nautical situation going on here is too cute to pass up. Sometimes you just need a frilly shirt, and one with a breezy babydoll silhouette will definitely keep you cool in the summer. Love a dramatic sleeve? The ties on each side make this white top anything but boring.  If you're looking for more coverage, try a long-sleeve shirt with a cute lettuce edge along the hem and wrists.

			 But both are STUNNING.  Prince Harry just married Meghan Markle on Saturday in a widely-anticipated – and heavily attended – wedding at Windsor Castle, but it was the Givenchy gown that was arguably the most show-stopping aspect of the ceremony. It was truly a timeless, stunning dress, but it was a far cry from the style of Princess Diana's dress when she married Prince Charles in 1981.  While Meghan's dress was a boatneck with long sleeves, Princess Diana's dress had a neckline that dipped lower and featured romantic ruffles.  Diana's silk taffeta dress also had larger sleeves (it was the '80s after all) and was designed by Elizabeth and David Emanuel, while Meghan's Givenchy number had a more fitted waist with a flared skirt and train.  Meghan's extremely long veil was also the center of attention with its lace details toward the end, and although Diana's was shorter in the front, she kept her veil long in the back so it dramatically flowed behind her. However, both brides kept their sheer veils in place with a sparkly tiara.  Meghan's was definitely more minimal, but made just as much of an impact as Diana's taffeta creation, and now all I can think about is that I'm sure they would have loved each other. I really don't have anything else to say other than weddings are so beautiful, y'all. *Cries forever* Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Also, your feet will love how comfy these are. Just sayin’.  While sky-high heels are losing their status as the It Shoe, the humble sneaker is definitely picking up momentum in their place. Whether you’re all about that athleisure life or you simply want to be comfortable, you can wear ’em for hours on end and they go with so many outfits. Here, shop 20 fashionable sneaker brands that’ll make your feet so, so happy.  Don’t knock Dr. Scholl’s. Yes, the shoes have memory foam insoles, but they’re anything but orthopedic-looking—just look at these cute perforated slip-ons! Odds are, you’ve seen tons of people wearing FILA’s Disruptor sneakers, and that’s because they are super padded and have a thick sole that cushions each step. The brand’s kicks definitely have an edgy streetwear aesthetic, and the same rings true with its clothing. Soludos is known for its beachy-looking smoking slippers, sandals, and espadrilles, but it also has cute sneaks, like this embroidered rainbow pair that’s perfect for summer. While Vans is synonymous with skate culture, it doesn’t mean you have to know how to pop an ollie to wear them. The checkerboard pattern, seen on these slip-ons, is a signature of the brand, and its Old Skool style with white contrast striping is a widely known silhouette great for everyday wear too. White Converse high-tops made a huge comeback circa 2016 and continue to be popular today. Both high and low styles from the brand come in an array of colors, so you can pick your favorite (or even multiple!) to wear with any outfit. Consider Saucony if you’re looking for a more retro shoe. Its vintage-y styles make for a fashionable look, while the durable rubber sole and cushioning are great for activewear. And if you need more of a traditional running shoe, the brand also offers sleeker designs with shock-absorbing features. From the brand’s Samba style (pictured here) to its recognizable Stan Smiths, Adidas has no shortage of trendy “fashion” sneakers in addition to its traditional running and workout shoes. The iconic designs look just as good with a pair of jeans as they do with leggings. This Brazilian-based sustainable brand has been around since 2004, and Meghan Markle also happens to be a fan. “Veja,” in Portuguese, means “look,” (which you don’t have to tell me twice—these tricolored kicks totally stand out). The popular V10, shown here, and Esplar silhouettes totally have a sporty ’90s aesthetic if that’s what you’re looking for. If you love the comfortability of sneakers but want a range of styles, Tretorn might be the brand for you. It has everything from these retro-looking two-tone ones to leopard-print, gingham, and sequined designs. While Puma is known for its athletic wear and sports shoes, it’s also a great go-to if you’re in the market for trendy kicks—take, for instance, these suede monochromatic ones. Rihanna’s Fenty Puma collection helped solidify the creeper as an It Shoe, and the brand also offers velvet and metallic designs for a luxe vibe. Superga’s 2750 Cotu canvas style, seen here, is one of Kate Middleton’s go-to shoes and has an impressive array of sneakers from platforms to espadrilles to slides. Plus, the range of colors ensures you can pair them with practically any outfit. Name a more immediately recognizable brand, I’ll wait. Keds has been making canvas shoes since 1916—Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Yoko Ono all wore them. I mean, even my grandma has been wearing the signature white pair since I was born. They’re undoubtedly timeless thanks to their iconic low-top silhouette. Nike’s fashion sneakers are perfect for double duty—their lightweight cushioning makes them great for the gym, but they also transition to everyday life, whether you’re running errands post-workout or you simply want to complete your street-style ensemble. The brand’s Air Max 97 style, seen here, is one of the most popular among women with its ripple-like lines and functional hidden laces. Yes, Golden Goose kicks are an investment. But the slightly worn-in look and its signature star details set them apart from the pack. If you find yourself trying to scuff new sneakers to make them look more distressed (guilty), consider this brand that already does it for you. How convenient! The brand’s name is a nod to the fact that there’s no new plastic in any of its shoes. All designs are made with 100 percent recycled post-consumer plastic. Impressive, right? It has low-tops and high-tops in a variety of shades with a simple logo on the tongue. The brand launched its minimal-looking sneakers in 2013 and specializes in low-top shoes featuring perforated leather, patent leather, suede, and knit material. Greats’ best-selling silhouette is the Royale, seen here and available in a range of hues. You may have seen Cariuma on your Instagram feed, and that’s because influencers can’t get enough of the Brazilian brand—Grown-ish’s Luka Sabbat often wears them. To simplify the selection process, it makes only four core styles (two low-tops and two high-tops) but offers them in various fabrics and colors. The brand launched in 2016 and immediately blew up thanks to its sustainable vision and because Time Magazine dubbed it “the world’s most comfortable shoes.” Allbirds’ most popular styles are the wool runners (shown here) and the tree runners, named for the materials from which they’re made. The brand’s handcrafted sneakers are made in Italy, and while its classic Capri low-tops (pictured here) are one of its core styles, it also offers high-tops, trendy thick-soled shoes, platforms, and slides. If you’re into super-simplistic sneakers that aren’t completely boring, opt for a pair of Common Projects. The brand gained a cultlike following when it launched in 2004—Drake, Nick Jonas, and Jennifer Aniston all have sported pairs, which feature gold-stamped numbers that represent the article number, size, and color.

			 It's about time!  On Monday, Reformation launched a collection of its best-selling denim in extended sizes 14-24. The denim was previously available only in sizes 0-12 (or waist sizes 23-31).  
  The release comes after Reformation's foray into extended sizing in March, a collaboration with model Ali Tate Cutler that carried sizes 0-22 and XS-3X. The other big news? The brand also shared it'll debut a permanent extended sizing collection in early 2019.   "We listen carefully to all comments and feedback we get, especially through social media," Reformation CEO and founder Yael Aflalo told Glamour. "While we got a lot of praise for the first extended sizing collection, we also got a lot of requests to make it more of a permanent collection and for more styles to be available in more inclusive sizes."  In the same interview Aflalo said extending the brand's denim sizing was a logical decision "because it’s something pretty much everyone wears all the time, and we want as many women as possible—regardless of shape or size—to have access to sustainable great-fitting jeans."  So, if you're a fan of Reformation jeans and have been waiting for more sizing options, you're in luck! And we'll be waiting not-so-patiently for the permanent collection to finally hit stores and online starting next year.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 I mean, just look at the shoulder pads on this.  Emma Stone appeared on the Met Gala red carpet with designer Nicolas Ghesquiere in a blue velvet dress with a plunging neckline and gold details by Louis Vuitton. She paired it with a box clutch, also by Vuitton, and black-and-white pumps.  But although the Met Gala had a religious "Heavenly Bodies" theme this year, it kind of looks like Stone's outfit was inspired by Michael Jackson?! Jackson was known for sporting military-style jackets, like this one at the 1993 Super Bowl.  And the chain details and military-style shoulder pads on Stone's dress seem very similar to the late-King of Pop's iconic style.  Whatever the inspiration, this dark teal blue is SO Stone's color. She kept her red hair swept to one side and opted for shimmery gold eyeshadow to match the gold embroidery and chains on her gown.  Although I'm not sure where the religious theme was in her ensemble, she does look v. heavenly in that last pic because she's basically glowing.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 They are amazing, and I want everyone to know.  I remember when skinny jeans were the *only* cool pant style to wear. I was in middle school and, for whatever reason, it was deemed by the fashion gods that bootcut, wide-leg, and straight-cut jeans were OUT, and denim so skinny you could barely get your ankles through the holes were IN. Like most trends, it's hard to pinpoint the genesis of this style. But because I was a fashion novice who also wore Abercrombie polos and Hollister tank tops to fit in (didn't we all, though?), I easily accepted them into my life and have worn them with every outfit that has required pants ever since. Case in point: these extremely tight pants in 2016.   But last summer, I found myself in a dilemma. I was hunched over my laptop, frantically adding items to my cart in an online sale, when I stumbled across a pair of wide-leg cropped Brock Collection jeans. They were unlike any pair I owned, yet I found myself clicking on the product page, unable to look away. I was transfixed by the high-waisted cut, the wash, the oversize leg holes, the crop at the ankle that was just right, and, duh, the amazing deal, so I overcame my hesitation and took my biggest fashion risk yet: buying a pair of jeans that were — gasp — NOT skinny.   I bought them at Moda Operandi, a luxury e-commerce site I worked for at the time, and everyone at the company absolutely raved about the fit of  straight-leg Brock Collection jeans. Although I only heard great things about them, I wasn't about to drop $500 on denim. But when a sale hit, and the wide-leg version was available in my size for just $69, it would have been a crime not to buy a pair. Or at least that's how I convinced myself, anyway. And let me tell you, they are the best thing that's ever happened to me — and that includes the time I entered a raffle and won free DreamDry blowouts for a month.  
 Crop Wide Leg Jeans, TOPSHOP (Available at Nordstrom), $75 SHOP NOW Hi-Rise Wide Crop Jeans, FOREVER 21, $33 SHOP NOW Crop Wide Leg Pants, RIVER ISLAND (Available at Asos), $51 SHOP NOW Striped Crop Trousers, MANGO, $70 SHOP NOW  As soon as I clicked "Complete Checkout," however, I panicked — I had no idea how I'd style them. The slight ankle crop, wide legs, and high-waisted look was not what I was used to, and I wasn't sure if the silhouette would look strange. But that was only because I was so used to wearing super-tight, blood-constricting, jump-up-and-down-to-squeeze-in-them skinny jeans with everything I own. When I finally received them and tried them on, they fit perfectly, although seven months later they've stretched to the point where I wash them more frequently just so they'll temporarily shrink. But the more relaxed fit also isn't a bad thing, and I actually really like it. Despite my initial hesitation about how to style them, they've turned out to be one of the most versatile pieces in my wardrobe. I pair them with my go-to white Vans and a tucked-in shirt, lace-up flats and a knit sweater, or sandals and a cropped tank — it's surprisingly easy to incorporate these jeans into any outfit. So easy, in fact, that I've also (completely unintentionally) worn them every day this week, and I'm 100 percent sure my co-workers have noticed. But hey, when you love something, you never let it go. Or, in my case, when you almost always get compliments from strangers on your jeans, you wear the sh*t out of them. 
  They're so comfortable, the denim isn't stiff, the high waist has made me wear more of my crop tops that were just sitting in my closet, and I wish I owned at least five more pairs all in different washes. Plus, your legs will feel amazingly breezy in a way that's impossible with crazy-tight skinny jeans. I'm currently coveting this similar version from Everlane.  If, like me, you can't get enough of this style, here are more wide-leg options — so you, too, can feel the freedom of never wearing uncomfortable-to-sit-down-in skinnies again.

			 Finally. On Tuesday, just two days before New York Fashion Week officially begins, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, in partnership with the Model Alliance, has announced that for the first time ever, models will have a private area to change at the shows. If you go backstage during NYFW, you might find any number of people — members of the press, show runners, PR reps, photographers, and more — milling about as models strip down and change into their show outfits. In the many years that NYFW has been going on, models simply have had to get dressed in front of everyone as if it were no big deal. "Models have raised concerns about invasive photography and lack of privacy while changing clothes backstage at New York Fashion Week," Model Alliance founder Sara Ziff said in a statement. "The Model Alliance takes these concerns seriously, and we decided to take additional steps this season to ensure a safe and respectful work environment by providing private changing areas backstage." The CFDA and the Model Alliance have worked with IMG and Pier59 Studios, which hosts many of the runway events during NYFW, to build these spaces. Right now, it's unclear what the areas will look like and whether or not they'll be limited just to the shows at Pier59 — or if they'll be a fixture at every official show, although all participants have been encouraged to comply. What is clear: These concerns, and other issues surrounding sexual harassment and safety, are now the focus of the fashion industry in America. In an open letter dated Feb. 1, CFDA chairwoman Diane von Furstenberg wrote, "The current climate has been marked by brave women and men and their revelations about an unacceptable culture in politics, sports, and entertainment, as well as in fashion." The statement outlines the three main focuses — health, safety, and diversity — of an evolved initiative to ensure the standards in the fashion industry in America are up to date: In addition, the CFDA has provided a clear outline for what sexual harassment means to them, per the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission:  A step in the right direction.

			 One hundred models signed an open letter urging modeling agencies, brands, and media outlets to take part.  At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in Denmark on Wednesday, 100 models grouped together to announce the Respect program, which aims to end sexual harassment in the fashion industry.  The new program, led by Model Alliance founder Sara Ziff, asks brands, modeling agencies, and media outlets to sign a contract to protect models. With the legally-binding agreement, models can file complaints through a confidential process, protecting them from retaliation and guaranteeing an investigation by an independent source. Models including Karen Elson, Doutzen Kroes, Teddy Quinlivan, Milla Jovovich, Edie Campbell, and more signed an open letter calling on agencies, publishers, and designers to join Respect "in a commitment to real change."  “The program establishes an orderly and fair process for addressing charges of abuse. It provides comprehensive training and education to models and all industry participants," Ziff said  in an interview with WWD. "This system benefits models, photographers and other service providers, and every company that wants to do the right thing. The only people who don’t benefit are the harassers themselves.” The Respect program comes after the industry was rocked by reports at the beginning of this year that prominent fashion photographers like Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, Terry Richardson, and Patrick Demarchelier have allegedly sexually harassed or abused models.  In February, Model Alliance partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America to provide private changing areas for models ahead of New York Fashion Week. That same month, the CFDA also released a statement outlining the organization's three main focuses of health, safety, and diversity to prevent abuse and misconduct. "We have zero tolerance for unsafe environments and strongly encourage everyone in our industry to report abuse in the workplace," the statement read.  The Respect program follows these initiatives in protecting models, and Ziff said to WWD that she's encouraged by the response. "I think everyone is very aware of the problems in our industry and others and now we finally are able to move towards solutions,” she said.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Can you bustle a Met Gala gown? The 2018 Met Gala red carpet featured a lot of dra-MATIC looks. The trains were especially out of control. Pretty sure gowns with capes and skirts this long should be a fire hazard. Or, you know, a face-plant hazard. Now, here are all the trains, ranked from shortest to that-takes-up-the-whole-damn-room.

			 It had a 10,000-person waiting list last year, so yeah, don’t sleep on this.  Outdoor Voices, aka the workout brand everyone and their mother wears on Instagram, launched a swim collection (dubbed H2OV) today. So whether you need some cute new bathing suits before that beach trip or you finally want to ditch your old swimwear from high school (guilty), OV’s got you.  
  There are six in total, ranging from $45 to $100, and you can wear them either as a set (if matchy-matchy vibes are your thang) or mix and match in gorge shades of hot pink, yellow, orange, and green. The suits also happen to be chlorine-resistant and come with UPF 50+ UV protection. The brand released its debut swim line in June of last year that quickly sold out—the waiting list had a whopping 10,000 people on it, according to a press release—so, um, you Better. Start. Clicking.  Oh, also! OV announced its first-ever collaboration with the sandal brand Teva, and the multicolor designs are perfect for the warm weather ahead. They’re not available for purchase (yet!), but they will be on May 7, when you can sport them with your new ’kini, of course.

			 She did not bring Kanye with her. Kim Kardashian has been having a rough week what with having to defend her husband's indefensible behavior, but at the Met Gala she is back, baby, and Kanye West is nowhere in sight. She wore a gold sequined masterpiece of a Versace dress, and looked more incredible than she's looked maybe ever. Look at this! It's unreal! She looks like an Oscar, or the most beautiful, expensive disco ball you've ever seen in your life. Bless you, Donatella.  Follow Eliza on Twitter.

			 Now I know what I’m gonna be wearing all summer.   On Thursday, Reformation announced its expansion into an entirely new category: shoes. And as you might’ve guessed, they’re all WAY cute. The brand’s debut line of footwear includes 11 styles of sandals, espadrilles, flats, and heels that are great for lounging poolside, picnicking in the park, or walking to your neighborhood ice cream truck (i.e. all your ideal summer activities). 
  The price point starts at $128 for these babies, so they’re not exactly inexpensive...BUT if you’ve been trying to find a warm-weather shoe that goes with all your breezy dresses, you’re basically guaranteed to find it at Ref. Another plus? Like all other products from the brand, the designs are made sustainably. Specifically, these use eco-friendly materials like chrome-free leather and jute (a vegetable fiber). The colors include basic black, white, and brown, but there are also brighter hues in green, red, and metallic gold. And a bunch of the styles have dainty, barely-there straps that channel ’90s minimalism, so if you’re a big fan of the “naked sandal” trend that’s been popping up, this drop is great news for ya. Free your toes and shop some of the designs below (including an incredible hybrid of flip-flops and kitten heels?!).

			 You can now rent pieces from Free People, Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and more! Nowadays, you can rent just about anything (West Elm decor, designer bags, and even furniture), but clothing is arguably the number one category when it comes to the rental economy—and now, another company is entering the mix. A new site, Nuuly, launches today, and important to note? It’s from URBN, i.e., owner of your fave retailer trio Free People, Urban Outfitters, and Anthropologie. So that means clothes from all these stores will now be available to rent on Nuuly.com. Amazing, right?!  It’s $88 per month to rent six items of your choosing. And yes, you are required to rent all six pieces to complete your order, but you can also rent the same thing in various sizes if you’re unsure of how it’ll fit, and that will count toward the goal. The items are delivered via UPS with two-day service and come in a reusable shipping bag. At the end of the month, customers will return all pieces using a prepaid label and the packaging they arrived in. A bonus is that the bags are made with reclaimed ocean plastics. Yay!   You can opt to return everything before the end of the month if you choose, but you won’t be able to rent other pieces until the next month. AND you must return or purchase your items in order to unlock your next month’s Nuuly, FYI. But that just encourages you to rotate your wardrobe more often!  In addition to clothing from the aforementioned retailers (FP, UO, and Anthro will make up more than one-third of the offerings), more than 1,000 third-party brands will be in the mix, including Avec Les Filles, Carolina K, LoveShackFancy, For Love and Lemons, AGOLDE, and others. Even unique vintage pieces like 1950s overalls, 1970s Loewe frocks, and 1980s Yves Saint Laurent jumpsuits will be included. Yes, really!!  Head of product Sky Pollard and director of marketing and customer success Kim Gallagher said in an email that while there are no immediate plans to expand into categories like accessories, they’re open to the option in the future. So it’s just clothes for now, but dang cute ones at that.   Pollard and Gallagher also said the site will constantly update styles, adding hundreds of new items each month to refresh the assortment. Customers can also have the option to purchase any pieces they rent from Nuuly at a discount form the retail price. Say no more.  Once you make an account, you can start browsing and choose items (or save them for later) you’d like to rent. Everything is managed through your profile, including your billing and shipping info, when your subscription renews, and even your rental history so you can keep track of what you’ve previously received—and maybe order it again or just buy the darn thing if you loved wearing it.  So if you’re like me and now inspired to rent a bunch of cute outfits, head to the site, like, um, right NOW.

			 SUCH a heartfelt and powerful finale.  Before the start of Brandon Maxwell's Fall 2018 show at the Appel Room in New York City on Sunday night, a note was left on each attendee's seat with a declaration of love: to the women with whom he works who make his shows possible, and to the women for whom he designs who wear his stunning creations.  And he followed through on that declaration by inviting  all the women who helped with his collection onto the runway, where Maxwell, the models, and the crowd celebrated and applauded them. At the finale, the models — including Gigi and Bella Hadid, Karlie Kloss, and Jourdan Dunn — lined up facing the audience, and Maxwell made an appearance to wave his team of women onstage to thank them for their work.    @brandonmaxwell Finale A post shared by  r. (@hescockky) on Feb 11, 2018 at 4:11pm PST  "My life dream was always to be able to use whatever talents I had to help women feel strong and powerful, the way they have for me, and if I’ve accomplished that with just one woman, then that’s a success," wrote Maxwell in an emotional Instagram post two weeks before his collection showed. "I felt more of a responsibility this season than I ever have before, to the women that wear our clothes, to the women that make them, and to myself, to do better, to be better."  Maxwell's show featured bright yellow jumpsuits, slinky and silvery dresses, casual denim ensembles, and a not-so-causal ballgown and hoodie combo modeled by Gigi Hadid. The collection's magical backdrop included bright pink and blue fog and an incredible view overlooking Central Park.     Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

			 No more slipping, tyvm.  Strapless bras can pose a real problem, but luckily, there are some real gems out there on the internet that not only stay up, but are actually downright comfortable. Really! Whether you like versatile styles (the option of removable straps is never a bad thing!), push-ups, or bandeaus, here are the 11 best strapless bras for every preference.   Notable 5-star review: I am freaking IN LOVE WITH THIS! HOLY CRAP! I have NEVER found a bandeau to work for my 34DDD bust. The band is always gigantic or the boob is entirely too small, it just never works. Well my gosh. I was SO skeptical ordering a medium. I was like, ‘there’s no way in hell this will work for me.’ WRONG. It’s great.  Notable 5-star review:  I’ve missed out on a lot of cute tops and dresses where a strapless bra was required. I have never owned a strapless bra because nothing worked and I gave up. I recently purchased a dress which I love, but it required a strapless bra. So I went on my journey to find one, dreading every minute of it. I tried this on based on the sales associates help and guidance and let me say... this bra is a game changer!! I love it. It fits great, feels great, and I feel very comfortable in it. I purchased the black color today and will be going back for the nude color. Notable 5-star review: I've never been able to find that elusive strapless that doesn't require me to awkwardly and desperately yank it up every 15 minutes. When I first tried this on, it didn't feel like it would stand up but alas, it did for hours and was super comfortable. I wore this all day on vacation and then on a long overseas flight, and it was so nice to be able to move freely without straps. Highly recommend this magical strapless bra! Normally a 34A, sized up to 34B, and it fits well although with a little extra room at the top of the cup.  Notable 5-star review: I love it! For us small-boobed girls, we don’t have much options in-store or even online, and it’s also really hard to find a good bra that fits. Thankfully, this one fit perfect. It’s comfortable, and I’m very happy with my experience. Wish there were more colors! Notable 5-star review: This is the best strapless bra I have ever worn. Its comfortable, doesn't show under clothing, and stays up. With other strapless bras, I am constantly going to the bathroom to pull it back up or am uncomfortable by making it so tight that it won't slide. My daughter wears this under leotards during ballet practice and under costumes during performances (as leotards and costumes often don't allow you to wear a regular bra without it being seen) and is very pleased with how it stays up and supports her. I hope they keep making this bra for a long time!  Notable 5-star review: This is the perfect backless bra that keeps you in place, supported and enough coverage. You do not have to worry about the bra slipping, bra stays in place and is extremely comfortable. Also you can use it several times without the support adhesive wearing out. To be on the safe side order a cup size up, to make sure for complete coverage and support. This is really a great bra for a backless, lower dress or top. Notable 5-star review: Strapless bras will never feel “barely there,” but this one is as close to comfortable as a strapless bra can be. It does not slip, doesn’t bunch or look awkward under tops. I’m usually a 36D and tried a half-size down this time. Feels like it was tailored for me.    Notable 5-star review: I wore this strapless from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. The entire day, I adjusted maybe 4 times. This bra is so painless I forgot it was on sometimes. I have worn other top-selling brands and get this weird piercing pain, but not with this! I was really happy. The mesh allows you to breathe all day and prevents sweating. The bra never buckled or slid down. It stayed in place the entire day for all of my movements. My only issue with Lively is that they do not carry brown bras as a nude for darker skin tones. Black does not always work. Notable 5-star review: This is truly the best strapless bra I have EVER owned. I wore it to a wedding in Texas, and it didn't move the whole night. I was scared I would have to hide in the bathroom and pull it up countless times, but it was perfect! It's also super comfortable; I'm used to being poked by awkward wires, but this was a dream, and comfort-wise it felt like I was wearing a bralette. I would highly recommend this bra. Notable 5-star review: I pretty rarely give 5 stars when writing a review (and I pretty rarely write reviews). This bra is amazing. When I tried the Felina on, I was floored. This is the ONLY strapless bra I have every felt comfortable wearing all day. One of the reviews I read mentioned this as well, but I didn't really believe them. I'm telling you, it's true. I totally forget I'm wearing it!! Strapless Nirvana!! I came back to buy another one and decided to write this review. Honestly, I don't do this lightly—this one is the BEST.  Notable 5-star review: This is some kinda magical space-age bra. I haven't been able to wear a strapless bra since my teens. This thing is amazeballs. The band and cup fit is perfect and the wide band is very supportive without being intrusive- in fact this little strapless bra is more supportive than the extremely uncomfortable and much longer fully-boned bustier I had to wear at a friend's wedding a couple years ago. Reviews have been edited for clarity.

			 But remember, what is ~not~ sexy when it comes to Halloween costumes? Cultural appropriation, that's for sure. Online retailer Fashion Nova just dropped a line of "sexy" Halloween costumes, because who is shopping for anything else online in October? (JK JK, I know we're all buying pumpkin spice scented candles.) And everyone's invited to the site's Halloween costume party, with men's and women's costumes for, as well as All Hallows' Eve fashions or children's AND, wait for it, pets!! You can dress your cute doggy up as a baby shark, for example, or as "Daddy's Lil' Monster" Harley Quinn. SHOP NOW Beyond the to-be-expected sexy skeletons, cops, convicts, and bunnies, Fashion Nova's designers have gone down, well, quite the rabbit hole for pop culture inspiration. Peep some of their creations below, and see if you can guess what they are copying loosely basing the lewks on, i.e. just loosely enough to avoid any copyright claims clearly:  Note: Valak, the only nun (well, nun-possessing demon to be exact) you should be worried about this Halloween/FOREVER, is not likely to approve. SHOP NOW SHOP NOW This comes along with co-ordinating "scaredy lion," "where's my brain at?" and "no place like home" costumes, FYI, just in case your squad intends to blow the costume competition away (like a twister). Oh, but ALSO THE SEXY TIN MAN COSTUME IS SOLD OUT!! Can you even believe it?! SHOP NOW (It's Maleficent, but you already knew that.) SHOP NOW You could sex-up Kourtney Kardashian's 2017 Halloween look with this costume. In related looks, the brand is also selling a sultry Selena Quintanilla-inspired "La Flor" costume—practically identical to the ones Kim K, Demi Lovato, and America Ferrera wore in Halloween 2017 to respectfully pay homage to the Latina diva.   It's not full-on Pennywise, but IDK, those blood red pom-poms are problematic. SHOP NOWStill, the brand—much like popular lingerie and costume store Yandy  and many other costume sites—has fallen into the pitfall that is problematic costume ideas. (Why is this still happening?!) Fashion Nova's collection includes a sexy "Geisha costume," which is not only a case of cultural appropriation, but also perpetuates the misunderstanding of the geishas' role in Japanese history. FYI: No, they are not sex workers.  There are also some questionable-at-best ninja costumes, and a "Señorita Muerte" costume, which does a poor job of honoring the Mexican tradition of the Day of the Dead. Despite receiving criticism, Fashion Nova has yet to pull these costumes. They have also not yet commented after Teen Vogue reached out for a statement. A related petition, meanwhile, is asking sexy costume mainstay Yandy to pull all its costumes "inspired by" indigenous people from its site—and it's coming up on 10,000 signatures. For more costumes you need to absolutely avoid, look here. Basically, if in doubt, dress up as a cupcake instead. Follow Jasmine on Instagram.

			 Because why not wear both?  Amal Clooney just graced the Met Gala red carpet on Monday night in a half-pants, half-dress ensemble by British designer Richard Quinn, and she looks so dang gorgeous. (And sure, you too, George!) She is a co-chair of the event, alongside Rihanna and Donatella Versace, whose theme is "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination."  She wore navy cigarette pants with a silver bustier top and statement earrings, but the real star of her outfit was the super huge flowing rose-patterned cape behind her.  She swept her hair into a loose ponytail and added silver statement earrings and a bold red lip (using a mix of Charlotte Tilbury's matte liquid lipstick in "Screen Siren" and "Walk of Fame") to complete the look. Husband George was sharp in a black-and-white suit and bow tie. The last time the couple attended the event together was in 2015, but Amal was on the cover of Vogue's April issue, and it seems they've made a triumphant (and quite fashionable) return to the Met.  I mean, just look at this cuteness!  OK, I'm done obsessing over their love. Amal, keep working that dress though!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 It's definitely a pre-Met Gala LOOK. In anticipation of Monday night's Met Gala, Vogue held a pre-party in New York City on Sunday night, and Ashley Graham showed up in an all-metallic outfit. It included a long overcoat, silver Giuseppe Zanotti slingbacks, and even  a black and gold Gucci phone case.  
  But the real showstopper was her super-mini silver dress, which featured a low-cut neckline. W-O-W: I mean, just look at her — she is GLOWING and SHINY and BEAUTIFUL. Here's another pic on her Instagram feed, where she looks like a straight-up bombshell with those bouncy curls and her hair parted to one side.    Partiessssss A post shared by  A S H L E Y  G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on May 5, 2018 at 10:05pm PDT She also posted another Instagram photo at the event with fellow model Ruby Aldridge.   Hey Ruby😻 A post shared by  A S H L E Y  G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on May 6, 2018 at 8:20pm PDT Graham wore a one-shoulder red and white gown by H&M to last year's Met Gala, but what she chose for the big event this year is still under wraps. What I do know is that she's really going IN on her beauty routine to prepare. She documented her nose hairs getting (what looks like very painfully) zapped while wearing protective goggles. All in the name of the Met Gala, I suppose.   MET morning, getting nose hairs zapped! @mziashiman A post shared by  A S H L E Y  G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on May 7, 2018 at 9:05am PDT Can't wait to see what you wear, Ashley, and hope the inside of your nose is doing OK!

			 Hell yes, duchess! We're back with another episode of Meghan Markle Looked Really, Really Good in Some Clothes! On Wednesday, while on her tour of Ireland with Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was spotted at the Gaelic Athletic Association at Croke Park wearing a very sleek black pantsuit by Givenchy. It was her fourth outfit of the day, which sounds exhausting!   The black-and-white set seemed like quite a departure from her recent delicate blush dresses, bateau-neckline silhouettes, and midi skirts, which honestly made the otherwise timeless ensemble feel fresh and bold.  She paired the suit with the Givenchy Frame clutch, which she's worn before, and a matching belt by the brand, topping off the whole outfit with black pumps by Sarah Flint. Simple. Stylish. Lovely! But now for why you're really here: fun pics of Meghan and Harry! Look at these two watching the sports!!! How cute are they? What kind of naughty thing do you think he's saying here?  Ugh, these two!!   Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 It's having a major moment this fall. Corduroy enjoyed status as a fall and winter staple in the '80s, '90s, and early aughts, but somewhere along the line, it got a bad reputation, and no one wanted to wear it anymore. All of the sudden, somewhere in the 2010s, you wouldn't be caught dead in it, poor thing.  Well, that's all over now, because designers and retailers are betting big on the fuzzy fabric this season, and it's looking damn cute, if I'm being honest. Here's why you should invest in cords as the temps cool down this year. It's no coincidence that the fabric is back on the rise as the '80s and '90s simultaneously have their fashion resurgence. With that aesthetic showing no signs of waning for fall and winter, embracing cords is a great idea for anyone who wants to feel With It. 
 Cords are fuzzy and velvety, which already gives off a snuggly aura. But they're also super warm, meaning they'll keep you nice and toasty through the colder weather. 
 Cords are basically the velour version of denim, which is to say you can get corduroy E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G: pants, skirts, shirts, dresses, jackets, shoes. With so many options, you surely can find a way to fit them into your wardrobe. 
 Texture is a huge element of a successful outfit—it adds interest and depth to something that otherwise would seem one-dimensional. Following this line of thinking, incorporating cords into your ensemble will make you look more put-together and polished. If you're not sure how deep you wanna dive into the corduroy universe, start small—try an accessory or a layering piece. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Your fave viral online shopping site just got into menswear. Fashion Nova, the viral e-commerce site you've seen all over Cardi B and Kylie Jenner's Instagram feeds, launched its first-ever menswear line at midnight on Tuesday.

			 Have you noticed that actually every single person on your feed is doing this? Let's get right to it: There's a pose that absolutely everyone is doing on Instagram right now, and if you haven't noticed it yet, you're about to in a major way. It's been coined the "Barbie Feet" trend, because, well, you'll see:   Basically, when an Insta star doesn't have high heels on, they point their toe as if they're wearing them anyway — much like Barbie's perpetual foot pose. Mastering this positioning will basically make you look like you have mile-long legs, particularly if your photographer is shooting you from below. See? Long-ass legs. Legs for days. It also works with just one leg pointed. And it still gives off the optical illusion when you're sitting down. It can also be done in sneakers, FYI.  Now, go forth and do with this information what you will. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Why is he so hard to shop for? If your dad already has everything he needs and is so hard to shop for, you've come to the right place. At least one of these unique ideas should be perfect for him! Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Okay, odds are he already has a cooler, but this one comes in backpack form and can fit an entire 12-pack of beer—with ice—inside its main compartment. Of course, it is also tall enough to fit a few bottles of wine inside, if that's more his thing. He may have those blue-looking cold packs at home, but, I assure you, he does not have leak-free, stainless steel ones. These babies are much better looking than their older counterparts, plus they will keep your cooler contents chilled for four to six hours! Help him maximize his time at the beach this summer—or just have fun in the yard—with this set of multi-tone wooden paddles and rubber balls.   For the dad who loves to cook or grill, there's no better tool than a chopping knife he's made himself. This kit comes with a blank knife he'll have to sharpen perfectly and a wooden handle he'll have to carve and screw into place. Speaking of cooking, grilling, baking, what-have-you: Why not upgrade his standard oven mitts with a colorful leather one? And while we're at it—help him get his coordination on with a matching leather apron that'll keep him protected whenever he's attempting dinner. Sure he's got a wallet, but for those times he doesn't want to carry all his cards, cash, and receipts, this timeless money clip will come in handy. A movie buff will love this tiny projector that can hook up to his laptop or phone. It works on any solid surface and can project up to 11.32-feet of screen from mere inches away. If he wants, he can also use the device at work, as it is compatible with USB and HDMI cords and dongles. Excuse me, but does he like spice? Maybe he'll enjoy this subscription that'll have three new hot sauces appearing at his door every three months. Get him out of his classic slippers and into a pair of striped pool slides that will keep his feet happy, but be a tad more stylish in case anyone's coming over. Photography his thing? Yeah, digital pics are great and all, but he might appreciate the new version of this vintage Leica camera. Sports fans will appreciate this customizable set of trading cards with his picture, logo, and team in the same design as the professional MLB players' merch.  If your dad truly has everything, the one thing he couldn't already own is a future trip. A cool staycation spot, like this vintage airstream Airbnb trailer located in California's wine country, might be the perfect present. But if that's out of the budget, try going on a day trip, like a hike in a nearby park. IDK, sometimes a guy just needs a pair of llama socks. A spare deck of playing cards is always useful, and this ultra classy duo will look elegant on his game table. He may not *need* a take-it-anywhere fire pit but he definitely wants one. If pizza is his food group of choice, he'll love this boxed set of supplies that will help him grill up the best-tasting pie of his life. If pizza isn't his thing, just check out this site, Man Crates: They've got something for pretty much any hobby or interest that he's into. File this under "Things You Never Knew Existed But Also Sound Amazing."

			  Gimme all of these.  There's always a reason to get your wife or partner a little something. Whether it's their birthday, you're celebrating an anniversary, or you're just trying to show how thoughtful and surprising you can be, here are 28 pretty gift ideas that'll demonstrate how much you care. Or...if you want to be on the receiving end, just leave this page open on your web browser. *Hint, hint.*  Sweater weather is coming up fast, so what better gift than a pink-and-red striped turtleneck? They can dress it down with jeans or up with a midi skirt and heels.  Hatbands (aka padded headbands) are this season's "it" accessory, and they'll love wearing this marigold one with their hair down or in a chic chignon.  A pendant on a delicate chain is the way to her heart. Seriously, sometimes it's just that simple. This ethical brand also happens to employ artisans in Africa to make its gorgeous designs.  Bring on the velvet this season in the form of these pretty burgundy booties, obviously. A simple two-piece set featuring a lip shade that reacts with the natural pH of your lips and an inky black mascara that majorly curls lashes will definitely be up her alley.  Sweater dresses are about to be everywhere, but this one stands out with its metallic threading that adds serious shine. It'll become their fave thing to wear when it starts to get cold.  A rich rose fragrance with notes of cedarwood, jasmine, and bergamot will do no wrong; plus, the top is magnetic so it easily comes off and on.  Sometimes all they wanna do is dance with the music as loud as it goes, and a Bluetooth speaker like this will let them live out their dreams. This baby has a 13-hour battery life and is waterproof in case of any spills.  A diffuser that gives off a constant scent of flowers throughout the room is a simple yet luxe present.  A boilersuit with cute front pockets and a slight crop will look SO good on them, trust me.  Another candle to add to their collection? Don't mind if you do. The "volcano" scent is one of Capri Blue's most popular fragrances for a reason, thanks to its notes of citrus and florals.  With fall approaching, they'll love a pair of straight-leg corduroys in a light pink shade—especially if they're tired of their plain ol' denim.  Croc-embossed textures are super on-trend, and they give this wine-colored bag extra interest. From the glossy finish to the unique dome shape, this is truly a statement-making accessory.  A minimal gold catchall that's beautiful both on its own and with jewelry in it is a thoughtful yet no-fuss gift they'll use every day.  Their skin will straight-up glow with a set of six products including a serum, mask, cleansing oil, and skin cream from this Meghan Markle–approved beauty brand.  A pair of classic frames in a burgundy shade will elevate any of their fall outfits; plus, the gold accents add the right amount of bling.  An insulated wine glass will keep any drink chilled (champagne or chardonnay, anyone?), and you can choose from four colors.  Their new everyday staple will be this stack of gold, silver, and rose-gold rings with baby white diamonds. They can be worn separately too!  A gold-framed photo from your wedding, engagement shoot, or just a cute candid will make them say "Awwww!" and be quick to put it on display.  Chic, minimalist cast iron is the perfect present for a gourmand. Its enamel finish makes for easy cleanup, while its heat-retaining ability makes it great for both the stovetop and the oven.  Every year, they probably say, "I don't need any presents!," but if you know better than to listen to that, a gorgeous bouquet of flowers is totally the way to go. Bold teardrop earrings definitely stand out, and they'll love the shimmery Swarovski crystals.  They work hard and need some major zen in their life, so get them a luxurious foaming bubble bath with notes of lavender and white orchid.  If their goal is to get a blissful eight hours of sleep (or more, TBH) every night, they'll appreciate a luxe silk eye mask that helps them accomplish just that.  Lazy weekends are totally their vibe, but if they need new loungewear, get them a matching set with contrast trim that they'll happily snuggle in when you're watching movies or making breakfast.  Do they always make vacation plans for the two of you? Then they'll adore a colorful duffel that's great for weekend getaways and also makes the perfect carry-on.  Whether they wake up early for yoga class or are just generally into hitting the gym, they'll love a pair of two-tone leggings that feature a convenient waistband pocket and sweat-wicking fabric.  You guys text throughout the day, but with cold weather approaching, gloves make communicating harder. A cute pair that can transition to a fingerless style will keep their hands warm while their fingers are free to text.

			 Exposing the fast fashion brand's even faster hustle.  When Kylie Jenner celebrated her 21st birthday in August, the beauty mogul toasted herself in a pair of pink looks: a satin mini dress by Peter Dundas and a sequined strapless romper by LaBourjoisie. The second ensemble, the one that looked as if a tube top and biker shorts took a bath in bubblegum sparkles, was custom, naturally. But if it had hit retail racks, it would have cost $8,000, according to the Kuwait-based eveningwear label. Encrusted with 70,000 Swarovski crystals, the bodysuit took 10 days to create—and just hours to knock off.  Less than a day after Kylie posted pictures to her Instagram account fast-fashion retailer Fashion Nova shared a $34.99 dupe on its feed, pairing it with the reality star’s birthday pic. The model even mimicked Jenner’s downward gaze and right-foot-forward pose. “Coming Soon!” the caption read. But how?   Kylie’s birthday looks epitomize the brazen, blatant new frontier of fashion fakes. Fashion Nova recreated both of her outfits, as well as the fluorescent pink Yeezy cutout mini-dress Jenner’s sister Kim Kardashian wore that evening, and posted pictures of all three less than 24 hours after the party. “The devil works hard but fashion nova (sic) works harder,” read one viral tweet with screengrabs of the listings. It was punctuated with laugh-cry emoji—and liked by nearly 96,000 people. So did Fashion Nova have some sort of head’s up, a sartorial equivalent of insider trading? Or was there a design team on standby, yards of glittery polyester waiting to be cut? And is any of this legal?  Fashion Nova has been around for more than a decade but grew in popularity in recent years, flooding the fast-fashion zone with several hundred new styles each week. The clothing is revealing—tight, barely-there streetwear and club attire—but the company is not. Founder Richard Saghian largely avoids the spotlight. A spokeswoman declined or did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Fashion Nova boasts more than 13 million followers on its Instagram feed and an army of 3,000 influencers, known as #NovaBabes, promoting its clothes. That group drove $54.1 million in earned media value, or the value of the publicity it receives via posts and engagement on social channels, from the second half of last year through the first half of this year, according to Tribe Dynamics, a San Francisco-based marketing technology firm. “They run one of the most sophisticated influencer programs that we track,” says Conor Begley, Tribe’s co-founder. Kylie’s birthday looks epitomize the brazen, blatant new frontier of fashion fakes. Among those influencers are big-name, well-paid celebrities. Cardi B is rumored to make $20,000 a month with Fashion Nova and has a capsule collection coming this fall. Kylie also has a relationship with the retailer, and Saghian once told The Cut that a post from her can result in $50,000 in sales.  Like many fast-fashion retailers, Fashion Nova offers a healthy share of “inspired by” pieces. Knockoffs are nothing new, although the way Fashion Nova presents them is. Most brands merchandise their recreations discreetly, leaving shoppers and fashion fans to draw their own conclusions. U.K.-based competitor PrettyLittleThing is still selling its recreation of Kendall Jenner’s 21st birthday outfit from 2016, a barely-there silver sequin mini also by LaBourjoisie. But its listing makes no mention of the model.  Fashion Nova, however, connects the dots. Its e-commerce listings for some knockoffs have the Fashion Nova version posted with a picture of the celebrity in her designer outfit. A high-necked white dress on sale for $49.99, for example, is paired with a picture of Cardi B on Saturday Night Live in a strikingly similar Christian Siriano gown. In an e-mail, Siriano told me the knockoffs are “not ideal” due to the potential to dampen his sales—but “flattering at the same time.”  What’s particularly confusing is that original Fashion Nova designs worn by celebrities are merchandised in a similar way. With a knockoff, the celebrity is on the right in the side-by-side pic; with an original FN design, the star is on the left. Shoppers who aren’t paying attention may not notice the difference. Further complicating things is that not all Fashion Nova recreations are presented with pics of the celeb. The brand knocked off the purple La Perla dress Kourtney Kardashian wore to Kylie’s party with no mention of her. The same is true for the recreation of the black PVC mini Kendall Jenner wore and Khloé Kardashian’s sparkly three-piece ensemble.  Seems so. Clothing is considered a “useful thing,” meaning it serves a purpose (in this case, it literally covers your body). Useful elements of creative things are largely exempt from copyright laws, says Julie Zerbo, an attorney and editor-in-chief of The Fashion Law. Only design elements that could exist on their own, like a print, are actionable, says Zerbo.  What would be grounds for legal proceedings is using the stars’ pictures alongside the knockoffs without permission. Celebrities get to decide how their image is used for selling stuff. “They alone have the right to control how their image is used in a commercial way,” says Zerbo, pointing to the 2014 case when Katherine Heigl sued Duane Reade after the pharmacy used her picture in a tweet. (Heigl later withdrew her suit after the parties came to an agreement.) With a knockoff, the celebrity is on the right in the side-by-side pic; with an original FN design, the star is on the left. Shoppers who aren’t paying attention may not notice the difference. Kylie and Kim’s pictures being used to sell knockoff versions of their designer ensembles—in tweets, on Instagram, and on Fashion Nova’s site—as well as their prior sponsored posts on behalf of the brand—would suggest that there's some sort of relationship. It’s possible their contracts allow such a thing, Zerbo says.  You have to wonder: Would Kris Jenner watch quietly if someone was using her daughters’ images to sell something, and they weren’t getting a cut?  Kylie’s reps declined to comment. Adding up the evidence—Kylie’s picture on the Fashion Nova site with her duo of dupes, which were advertised less than 24 hours after the designer debut, plus the known business relationship she has with the line—it seems quite possible that Kylie or someone on her team was in cahoots with the retailer, giving it a peek at her sartorial plans before they hit her Instagram feed.  “Woaw,” wrote one reviewer on the product page, three days after it was first advertised. “How in the world did they make this so quickly. You'd think they called her asking what she was wearing for her birthday.” Kylie or her team definitely tipped off at least one party before her, well, party: the cake baker. The five-tier cake was topped with a platinum-haired Barbie doll, face down into a tiny toilet, wearing a similar pink jumpsuit. Yet Kylie’s stylist, Jill Jacobs, insists no such fashion arrangement took place. “While in the process of designing the bedazzled jumpsuit with LaBourjoisie, I jokingly said that Fashion Nova was going to have a copy in a week. I was wrong—they had one made within 24 hours,” Jacobs wrote in an e-mail. “There was no heads-up given to anyone; all of the fast-fashion brands were simply on their game.”  You have to wonder: Would Kris Jenner watch quietly if someone was using her daughters’ images to sell something, and they weren’t getting a cut? Kylie’s reps declined to comment, but even if the team had leaked, Zerbo says there would be no legal issues with that kind of tip-off.  The only risk might be a designer souring on a star and perhaps refusing to dress her in the future. But really, if Kylie comes a callin’, who is going to say no to her and her 118 million Instagram followers? LaBourjoisie founder Antoine Salameh said in an e-mail that dressing Jenner results in a surge of inquiries and new followers. “For us to be able to dress someone of her stature provides us an unparalleled amount of exposure,” he says. He graciously acknowledged the inevitable high demand for a lower-priced version with this caveat: “We do hope that we are still credited for the conception and creation of the original design.”  So if Fashion Nova truly did this on its own, how did it pull it off? The most impressive thing it did was post a pic of its rapid-fire recreations so quickly. One-off samples for that purpose are easy to come by, a former high-ranking executive at a Fashion Nova competitor told me. You can make one of just about anything in a day, or even three different styles, as long as you have the staff on hand. Kylie’s birthday celebration was a pre-planned event, meaning Fashion Nova could have had the date it on its calendar (the way eveningwear makers often watch the Oscars red carpet). The brand also has a full-service in-house photo studio, making it painless to have a hair-and-makeup-ready model waiting for a quick shot. Saleable quantities of a garment—the first 1,000 or even 10,000—is a trickier pursuit. Making a pattern would be easy enough, given that all three of Kylie’s birthday recreations are Fashion Nova style specialties. It practically mints cutout mini dresses and strapless bodysuits (Kylie herself has previously worn a plain black one in an Instagram ad). It’s not a stretch, design-wise, to think that they had those patterns drawn up and adapted them to match the sisters’ looks. Access to the right, undyed fabric is helpful, too, says Felipe Caro, a professor in the operations management group at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management. Fashion Nova’s suppliers could have had loads of the nylon-spandex stretch fabric just waiting to become Kim’s pink mini dress. The biggest time savings comes from producing goods close to shoppers, eliminating transportation time from Asia or even South America, Caro added. It’s not a stretch, design-wise, to think that they had those patterns drawn up and adapted them to match the sisters’ looks. Fashion Nova declined to comment on its manufacturing process, but Saghian told WWD earlier this year that its buying and design team works with more than 1,000 manufacturers. Many are based in Los Angeles. Indeed, all three of the earliest Kylie recreations are listed as “Made in USA.”  The most revealing tell of all of this may be the actual selling timetable. Fashion Nova first posted pictures on August 10, the day after the party, saying they were “Coming Soon!” But it took more than three weeks, until September 3, for it to advertise two of the three dupes for sale. “The Wait Is Over!” the Instagram caption read. The pink bodysuit was promoted five weeks after the original post.  So yes, Fashion Nova is fast—just maybe not as fast as everyone has been led to believe. But, when you’re spending thousands of dollars less than your fave to look like your fave, does it really matter? Maybe not. As one Fashion Nova reviewer wrote about her Kim lookalike dress, ”This dress is everything! I got so many compliments on it!! I want to wear it everyday for the rest of my life lol.”

			 Millennial pink pool slides? YES PLEASE.  Those Memorial Day discounts are finally kicking in, and they gave the Internet one of the most anticipated sales yet: Nordstrom's Half Yearly Sale, which started on Wednesday. You'll want to wear all the floral dresses and gingham one-pieces to celebrate the long weekend and the warmer weather ahead, so here are the 28 of most Insta-worthy, summery pieces to add to your wardrobe.  A pale pink midi dress is so much more flirty with a bow on the bodice.  Opt for a breezy ruched top with romantic floral details this season.  Summer is the perfect time to upgrade your old crossbody bag to an unexpected periwinkle blue one that'll go with all your outfits. Switch up your current denim situation and try a pair of wide-leg jeans that'll make your legs feel so breezy in the heat.  A matching striped pajama set will make going to bed the chicest activity you do all day.  Snag a pair of summer sneakers in a pale blue shade.  If you've been thinking about buying a new swimsuit but haven't pulled the trigger, a sale is the perfect excuse to add a blue and white gingham one-piece to your cart.  A black-and-white polka-dot skirt can easily be dressed down with white sneakers or glammed up with statement heels.  If summer could be personified into a shirt, it would be a flowy white tank with adjustable tie straps.  Your jewelry collection will be happy to add a pair of gold stackable rings to its mix.  Millennial pink slides are the perfect mix of sporty and chic.  A striped woven bag serves as both a sturdy beach bag and a cute summer tote. If you've been searching for a summer dress you can throw on in a hurry, while still looking put together, slip into a printed maxi for an effortless outfit.  If you already own plenty of summer dresses, try a chambray jumpsuit with ruffle straps instead. Espadrilles are basically *the* shoe style every time summer rolls around, and a pair of neutral ones will immediately elevate any outfit. The off-the-shoulder style isn't going anywhere, so stay on trend with a sweet floral broderie crop top.  Add a pop of color to any look with a bright pink crossbody with an easy-to-open flap.  Swap out your denim for a pair of pale pink pants with a cute lace-up detail at the ankle.  A black pair of sandals that are dressy enough for work, but strappy enough to wear out, are practically a closet staple.  There's no other hue that screams "summer" like bright yellow, and a tie-front dress you can wear out and to the beach with a cute bikini underneath is key.  Three earrings for the price of one, this set is ideal for those with multiple piercings or for those who like changing earrings frequently.  Tan slides are shoes you'll need this season — the rich color will complement so many of your floral outfits.  There's nothing like a simple embroidered tee with palm trees will inspire you to take a beach trip.  If you don't shy away from color, a rainbow striped bikini top is totally up your alley — don't forget the matching bottoms!  Shorts season is the best season, and a light-wash pair with frayed edges will be your go-to denim.  Summer wedding season is upon us, so be prepared for your next wedding guest outfit with a formal, but pretty, lacy blue number.  A simple rose-gold chain is the perfect layering piece for all your other gold necklaces.  A midi dark-wash denim skirt will look amazing with a white T-shirt and sneakers, or you can make it more beachy with a patterned top and sandals.

			 Refuse to be part of this narrative.  I hate thongs. Can't stand 'em. I own one single pair, which I bought thinking it would somehow change my life and transform my underwear situation (no VPL!). But, alas, when I finally put them on, I was sadly mistaken—and highly uncomfortable. It literally just felt like I had a wedgie all day, and I wanted nothing more than to get that tiny piece of fabric up and out of my cheeks. But, similar to quicksand, the more I picked at it, the more it settled further into my crack. Basically wearing a thong is a big N-O for me all around.   So imagine my absolute horror when Kim Kardashian posted this Instagram pic of her Gucci G-string last August.   @kkwbeauty Contour Singles Available NOW kkwbeauty.com A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 21, 2018 at 7:24pm PDT Sure they're designer, but that didn't make this appalling situation any better. Who wants their crotch cradled by a mere three strands of floss?? Also, I'm aware that the high-cut silhouette is ~in~ with underwear and bikinis, but I was convinced these flimsy waist strings were actually defying gravity somehow. (Worse yet were reports that this particular G-string was actually from Tom Ford's '97 Gucci collection—meaning that it was, like, 20 years old. Ew.)  In that same month, Jennifer Lopez donned these Natasha Zinko pants with a matching gray thong, obv, while on set with DJ Khaled:   I can’t tell if she wanted me to take her picture? 🖤@jlo A post shared by  Rob Zangardi (@robzangardi) on Nov 15, 2018 at 8:01pm PST I mean, these win the award for the lowest-rise pants I have ever seen, but a coordinating plaid thong to go with them was just a LOT to take in. I was getting serious wedgie flashbacks just looking at this pic.  After these Instagram posts last year, I thought my whale-tail trauma had come to an end. But then fast-forward months later to May 2019, when Hailey Bieber picked up right where Kim and J. Lo left off in this Alexander Wang number at the Met Gala.   Met! Thank you for having me again @voguemagazine and thank you @alexanderwangny 💕 A post shared by  Hailey Rhode Bieber (@haileybieber) on May 6, 2019 at 8:59pm PDT Yes, her back looks actually amazing, but that's besides the point. At this moment I was practically begging the Thong Gods to make it stop. Please. But of course, why would they listen to me—a person who is against their very existence? So ignore me they did. And here's the proof: In June, Bella Hadid walked  the Versace runway with an exposed black thong:    Versace men’s ss20✨ I love you forever and ever @donatella_versace The queen ! And the Kings @pg_dmcasting @kjeldgaard1 @samuel_ellis Beautiful show @versace 💗💗💗 Thank you to the best team, it’s such a joy A post shared by  Bella (@bellahadid) on Jun 15, 2019 at 2:08pm PDT And shortly after that, Kylie Jenner hit Insta with this green whale-tail sitch:   ☁️9 A post shared by  Kylie ♥️ (@kyliejenner) on Jun 26, 2019 at 5:29pm PDT Listen, I'm all for nostalgic fashion trends. Beaded necklaces, jelly sandals, and bucket hats I can get behind. But a purposeful wardrobe malfunction (i.e. your thong rising up from the waist of your pants, far beyond where it normally would go) is just baffling to me. Add that with the fact that this "trend" is usually worn with low-rise jeans, and I'm terrified. This is not the path that our society needs to go down right now! Your butt probably doesn't want to feel like it's getting aggressively flossed at the dentist's office. But, hey, maybe I'm wrong and it does! Do you, I guess. (Also, thongs can spread some pretty gross germs around, too, if that has any impact on your underwear choice.)  So consider this my plea (and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, right? Anybody?) to keep whale tails where they belong, and not dredge them back up from the scary depths that they came from—aka the early 2000s. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.  These are a straight-up dream: They feel so soft against your skin, hug you in all the right places, and most importantly, don't go up your crack.  I am nothing if not an Aerie underwear devotee. These have that same smooth feel with stretchy lace but show off your cheeks more.  The material of these True & Co hipsters is like butter, and the not-too-low rise feels perfect on your waist; plus, these lay super flat on your skin.  This Chantelle pair is great if you like seamless styles and it comes in, like, 10 other colors—because once you wear these, you'll want 'em in every shade.

			 New jeans, new you. There are so many better ways to wear denim than regular old pants (boring!). Designers are making all kinds of fun things out of jean material now—think: bras, hair accessories, bags, necklaces, the list goes on. So this is the perfect time to put those skinnies back in the drawer and take a risk. You'll be surprised how fresh you'll feel just by making this one small style switch. Chokers If your casual outfit needs a little extra oomph, put on a denim choker. This model wears hers with an edgy faux-fur collared jacket, a red miniskirt, and a white shirt, but you could use yours to accessorize pretty much any other ensemble. Hint: The piece makes more of a statement when worn with low necklines — it draws extra attention to the accessory. Want to test the theory? Try it with a sexy black slip dress, and pair it with a coordinating puffer and matching accessories. Birdie Choker, DANNIJO, $495; Small Overlap Double Stick Earrings, JENNIFER FISHER, not available for purchase; Linda Jean Jacket, GUESS, $148; Valerie Bra, FILA, $34; Paperclip Ring With Crystals, JOOMI LIM, $140 $42 SHOP NOW $30 SHOP NOW $20 SHOP SIMILAR $180 SHOP NOW $85 SHOP NOW Jumpsuits You've probably seriously thought about buying a pair of overalls (or finally wearing the old ones you have in your closet) — but why not make the full leap into onesie territory with a denim jumpsuit? Here, it's pictured with a simple black jacket and a red beret, but you could make a bigger statement by accessorizing with a flashy red bag, sparkly, slouchy ankle boots, and a multicolor faux-fur coat. Dea Jumpsuit, A.P.C., $385; Beret, Model's Own, not available for purchase; Black Jacket, JACK THREADS, not available for purchase; Hisani Booties, NINE WEST, $76 $385 SHOP NOW $35 SHOP NOW $128 SHOP NOW $458 SHOP NOW Baker-Boy Hats All your favorite bloggers and street-style stars have been wearing this type of hat recently, so you may have thought about buying one. Test it out in a jean material! This model takes it to a very '70s place with fringe bell-bottoms, a vintage-inspired Levi's top, and a mini backpack, but you could just as easily pair the cap with a different graphic tee, an asymmetrical miniskirt, and a flashy red boot for a modern twist on the trend. Casquette Baola Hat in Blue, MKT STUDIO, not for purchase; Perfect Ringer Tee, LEVI'S, not for purchase; Cinched Wide Leg Jeans, PRPS, $198; Leopard Print Belt, LEVI'S, not for purchase; Elijah Rose Gold and Blue Denim Watch, LULUS, $20; Bradyn Small Denim Backpack, GUESS, $98; Denim Heels, CAPE ROBBIN, $40 $17 SHOP SIMILAR $10 SHOP NOW $55 SHOP NOW $399 SHOP NOW Shirt Dresses Shirt dresses aren't solely for work!

			 SO. STUNNING.  Your relationship isn't like everyone else's — why would you want your engagement ring to be? A simple gold band topped with a marquise-cut diamond dangling off the bottom is just the right mix of classic and unique. Your ring finger will definitely draw attention with a hammered gold spiral ring, and the row of diamonds will add a sweet touch of sparkle. If you really want to wow, try an open design with three floral-shaped prongs. Understated, affordable, and elegant, a classic baguette-cut stone is always a great choice. If this one doesn't quite have enough sparkle on its own, get a few and stack them in a staggered pattern. Pear-shapes are very trendy right now, and a pink version with a split shank setting and clustered diamonds will help you stand out from the crowd. Looking for something vintage-inspired? Try an oval-shaped opal surrounded by a halo of diamonds. If modern is more to your taste, think about an asymmetrical baguette-cut diamond ring. A twisted gold setting with pavé diamonds and a selection of baguette stones in the middle will definitely be an eye-catcher. Like the idea of a big stone but don't feel like something that large is necessary? Test out a negative-space ring with a halo of tiny diamonds. How fun would it be to have a white gold platinum zig-zag engagement ring with little pavé diamonds? Even better, you could mix metals, stacking the same ring in rose gold or yellow gold with it once you tie the knot. Pretty, light-colored sapphire stones are just as beautiful as diamonds, especially when combined with a simple yellow gold band. Most modern engagement rings are all about the stone, which means finding one that shows a little more artistry in the setting, like this one, will really be special. A ring with free-moving, dangling fringe details is sure to stun your friends and family when you share your good news. If you're trying for something interesting, but still dainty, a nested stone ring is a good idea. This one has both a diamond and an opal in a sweet, unexpected design. Adding a little color to an engagement ring is always a fun surprise. If you want to create even more drama, try a ring that mixes and matches two different colors of stones. Taking a classic cut and turning it on its side is a subtle, yet powerful way to make something old feel new. An open ring is always unique, and this particular geometric piece makes it look like the diamond-filled shapes just float lightly in between your fingers. A stunning stack of opals on a bed of diamonds will absolutely make a statement. At first glance, a pear-shaped stone in a sparkly halo setting may seem like a typical engagement ring, but the one major difference here is the center moonstone. I don't have to tell you what makes a ring with a long tail and striking oval-cut diamond so special — you can see it for yourself. An oval saphhire set between two white-gold bands and surrounded by black diamond pavé stones is truly a one-of-a-kind design. A triangle-cut stone is sure to separate your ring from a sea of round, oval, and emerald-shaped diamonds.

			 When Beyoncé and Jay Z kicked of their On the Run Tour II on Wednesday in Cardiff, England, fans were treated to footage of the famous couple dressed in white and surrounded by their children, Blue Ivy, 6, and twins Rumi and Sir, 11 months.  The video, which included the words "This is real love," definitely looked like a vow renewal.  Now, we have some proof that what fans saw in the video was indeed a vow renewal. Designer Galia Lahav confirmed in a press release that Beyoncé was wearing the couture label’s "Thelma" style wedding dress for a—direct quote here—"vow renewal."  The dress is from the designer's "Victorian Affinity" collection, inspired by Queen Victoria’s wedding dress. The off-the-shoulder dress featured Swarovski crystals and pearls embellishments.  While we'll have to wait longer (or maybe forever) to see a full-length picture of Bey in the gown, this video shows the dress from every angle:

			 RiRi, just take all my money already.  Updated, 5/10/19 at 10:55 am: It is OFFICIAL! Rihanna is giving us new music new fashion, and I’m ready to break the bank for it. The multi-hyphenate and luxury French fashion giant LVMH announced Friday that they’re going into the high-fashion biz together, creating a new fashion house that’ll be based in Paris.  According to a release, their first collection will debut in spring 2019 (which is like, right now!), under the “Fenty” logo. In a statement, Rihanna seemed pretty psyched about it all. “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” she said according to WWD. “Mr. [Bernard] Arnault [chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH] has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.” That’s basically all we know right now, but check out this LOGO:  @fenty . A post shared by  badgalriri (@badgalriri) on May 10, 2019 at 6:22am PDT Just take all my money already.  Original, 1/17/19 at 11:15 am: On Tuesday, our Queen Rihanna was spotted in New York City wearing statement oversize sunglasses, but forget that it was already dark out—something else was way more notable about these frames. The glasses had the word “Fenty” etched on the side, and of course, fans (myself included, naturally) are going crazy with speculation that she could be dropping an accessory line. She wore them again on Wednesday with a corduroy jacket and hoop earrings, and the name is DEFINITELY on full display.   Now, WWD reports that she’s in talks with LVMH, the world’s largest luxury group, NBD, to launch her very own designer fashion house. (*Internally screams.*) According to Hypebae, sunglasses are, in fact, an item protected under a Fenty trademark that was filed last year, however if this report is true, it means she’ll be releasing FAR more than eyewear. But all the buzz around her sunglasses and potential new fashion house is what she does best—RiRi is a pro at teasing products before anyone knows about them. Remember when she sneakily wore Savage X Fenty lingerie before it was even released?  She’s had major success in both the fashion and beauty world over the last couple of years between her Fenty PUMA collection, Fenty Beauty, and size-inclusive lingerie. (She’s also in the midst of suing her father for misusing the “Fenty” brand name, BTW.) But if these talks mean she’s expanding her empire to include not only sunglasses but an entire luxury fashion house, judging from her previous business ventures, it’ll no doubt be a success.  A representative was contacted for comment, and this post will be updated pending a response.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 *Books beach trip immediately.*   High-waisted swimwear is actually incredibly sexy, tyvm. From strappy details to revealing cutouts, you'll feel super confident wearing these bikinis, whether you're sipping drinks poolside or tanning (with sunscreen, plz) by the ocean.  A bikini featuring a loud red, orange, and pink pattern will definitely stand out when you're lounging poolside. Not a fan of traditional triangle or bandeau tops? Try a one-shoulder set instead. A smocked bandeau offers tons of stretch, and this suit happens to come in tons of different colors and patterns so you can find the perfect one that catches your eye.  An orange-red top with ladder cutouts over the neckline is ultra sexy, and the matching high-waisted bottoms pull it all together.  These sunshine-yellow bottoms with textured fabric are perfect if you prefer a ~cheeky~ cut. Pair 'em with a knotted strapless top for an adorb beach look.   Sure, these might seem like a simple pair of high-waisted bottoms, but turn around and you'll find a strappy cutout in the back. This style has an impressive 4.6 rating and also happens to look killer with an underwire top.  A bright multicolor suit goes well with summer's hot temps. The bottoms have just the right amount coverage, and the set even has UPF for extra protection.  Daisies on a baby-blue set are super cute, and the off-the-shoulder ties add a flirty detail. Want a high-waisted swimsuit that stands out from the crowd? This set, with its red and pink color scheme, is downright gorgeous, and the bottoms hug your hips in all the right places.  Front ties on the top and bottom level up a classic striped swimsuit. Want more subdued lines on your 'kini? Opt for this red-and-white set with ultra-thin horizontal stripes. The bottoms are also full coverage if you're into that.  You'll look like you came straight outta the '80s with bottoms that aren't only high-waisted but also have a high cut (i.e., the leg openings sit above your hips). Celebs like Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and literally every Victoria's Secret model have been rocking the style lately.  The wraparound element on this bikini is super sexy, while the underwire in the top adds support.  Red bikinis are basic, but not when they come with sweet scallop detailing around the top and bottom.  A marigold hue is a pretty color on any skin tone; plus, the cheeky silhouette of the bottoms are wildly cute.  This black-and-white set gives off total pinup vibes, and the pattern makes it easy to mix and match with other colors.  Treat yourself to a swimsuit worthy of all your vacation Instagrams.  The fabric has UPF (bonus!), and the suit is made with eco-friendly practices (double bonus!).  Be an IRL peach emoij all summer long in this knotted top and high-cut bottoms made from knitted material.  Tell us: Can you ever *really* go wrong with an LBB (that's a little black bikini for ya)? All about standout swimwear? Opt for florals against a teal background. This set features adjustable straps and is available in sizes XS to 4X.  A smocked strapless top is easy to pull on if you're not about dealing with straps. Pair it with high-cut matching bottoms for the most summery beach look.  A classic black-and-white suit is so much saucier thanks to contrast piping and criss-cross detail.

			 "I don't know why you thought that caption was cute but reconsider forreal," one commenter wrote.  On Monday, designer Jeremy Scott posted new campaign images from his latest collection for Moschino, including what he called an "alien" Gigi Hadid with blue skin. When he first posted the photo, the original caption read: “THE ONLY THING ILLEGAL ABOUT THIS ALIEN IS HOW GOOD SHE LOOKS!” Commenters fired back almost immediately, asking him to change his caption in light of the current immigration crisis at the border.   Scott replied to one of the comments with this statement: He later changed the original "illegal alien" caption and replaced it with a similar reply.  Some commenters did come out in support of the designer and the message of his campaign:  Scott also sent models with blue, green, orange, and yellow skin down the runway for Moschino's Fall 2018 show in February and told Vogue his political message for the show at the time: “I’m not anti-alien; I don’t want to build a wall.”  This isn't the first time the designer has stirred controversy. In June 2012, he partnered with Adidas to release the JS Roundhouse Mid, sneakers featuring an orange shackle around the ankle. The design was canceled following outcries that the shoes referenced slavery. Scott took to Twitter and said he was inspired by a childhood toy, while Adidas said the design was "nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery."  MY WORK HAS ALWAYS BEEN INSPIRED BY CARTOONS, TOYS & MY CHILDHOOD...  http://t.co/gLzTR4sh His latest ad campaign also features models like Kaia Gerber and Vittoria Ceretti, although the original comment was only on Hadid's photo.    A Moschino representative had no further comment than Scott's edited Instagram caption. Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 It even passed my night-out test.  I gave up on strapless bras a long time ago. If I encounter an outfit that can't be worn without one, I usually free-boob it or just change if I’m headed somewhere I can’t risk having my headlights on.  A year ago, I made the absolute rookie mistake of wearing an unlined bandeau under a strapless dress, which ended up down around my waist after a light jog to make a train. Sitting on public transportation, deciding whether to stick your hand down the front of your dress to fetch your rogue bra or simply let it sit around your waist while your boobs just sorta hang there is truly harrowing.   But just last month, Cosmopolitan's fashion team published the Bra Awards; a roundup of products our editors promised would allow boobs to "live their best life." I was a little skeptical that their winners might not be right for my DDD cups. Don't get me wrong, I wholeheartedly trust the Cosmo team with my life, but my boobs' life? IDK—it's so personal. I skipped to the strapless section of the awards, because that’s where I obviously need the most help. Although I’d been previously burned by bandeaus, the Women’s Angel Seamless Underwire Bandeau Bra among the honorable mentions caught my eye.    Clicking over to Amazon, I found reviews from women with the same troubled-boob past as me.  Okay, I'm listening.  As a 5’0” woman with a 32DDD bra size, I squealed while reading. I’ve rarely even seen women with my measurements pipe up in any review section, let alone to leave positive comments. I immediately ordered the bra in nude and black in a small, but kept my expectations to a minimum. (FYI, it also comes in rose, eucalyptus, and white colorways.) It was SO comfortable. When the bras finally arrived, they sat in the unopened mailer package on my floor for a week, because, like I said, my expectations were low. I finally opened it an hour before I was supposed to meet my best friend for dinner and drinks. I wanted to wear an off-the-shoulder sweater, but didn't really want to rock a visible strap.  I slipped into the black bra, and even though it had underwire, it was SO comfortable.  I am also happy to report that it stayed put ALL night long. It didn't budge when I threw up both arms to a remix of Without Me by Halsey, or when I sprinted to grab dibs on the bar's last open table.  I also didn't end up with the bruises and bumps that I typically get when I wear underwire. I love this thing so much that I'm about to start finding excuses to wear off-the-shoulder shit through the rest of winter and beyond. More strapless bras to try, right this way:

			 So cute and colorful! As soon as spring rolls around, you're gonna see these 31 trends legit everywhere. So, scroll on to get in on the action before everyone else and be the trendsetter you were born to be! Not necessarily a new thing, but monochrome neutrals are still gonna be majorly hot for spring 2019, as Kendall Jenner demonstrates here. Burberry Max Mara Tom Ford Macrame and crochet had major moments on the spring/summer '19 runways and the fishnet pattern in particular was a big deal.  Louis Vuitton Altuzarra 3.1 Phillip Lim Paisley and bandana prints are going to show up on way more than just scarves this spring, FYI. Etro Chloé Loewe Polkadots are all grown up now thanks to statement black-and-white patterns at Celine, Carolina Herrera, and Jaquemus. Celine Carolina Herrera Jacquemus The '90s are still back for spring 2019, and all the butterfly details from the runways are proof. Naeem Khan Zang Toi Jasmine Another major '90s influence? Checkerboard patterns everywhere. Oscar de la Renta Christian Cowan Veronica Beard Looking for the next color you should invest in? Go for pastel blue. Alice + Olivia Marc Jacobs Ph5 Solid pieces with multiple colors were a major hit on the spring '19 runways.  Escada Prabal Gurung Tibi Bike shorts are A Thing now, people, and I guess we all have to accept it. Area Laquan Smith Maryam Nassir Zadeh As previously mentioned, lots of designers breathed new life into this '70s trend, so you'll be sure to see the knitted pieces everywhere come March.

			 The kids of your fave '90s stars tell Cosmopolitan how to make the decade's looks relevant now. The shapeless, oversize clothing; the too-bold patterns; the bucket hats—you'd have to be crazy to want to time travel your closet back to the '90s, right?! Wrong. Because they're baaaa-aaaack *The Shining voice*. Suddenly, the decade that brought us butterfly clips, square necklines, and spaghetti straps is everywhere, from the runways and the streets of New York to hole-in-the-wall boutiques and fast-fashion retailers.  But how do you test the waters of nostalgic style without feeling like you're wearing a costume? Here, several It girls whose parents ruled the 1990s show how it's done today. Visions of sullen-looking teens in chain-laden baggy pants and beat-up, oversize flannels may come to mind when you think of '90s grunge. Today's version draws inspiration from some of these styles but gives them a modern twist. Amelia Hamlin, daughter of actors Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, shows just how to turn this trend on its head. For example, instead of wearing those silver chains on her belt, she wears three of them, connected, as a chunky necklace. The effect is super cool and definitely grungy, without the weighed-down feeling of yore. "Maybe three years ago I had a grunge phase," the 17-year-old says. "I wore a lot of checkered, big squares and dark colors. It's not really me anymore, but modeling-wise I can channel it very easily." For Amelia, wearing '90s style in the wild means applying that timeless adage "less is more."  "The simpler you are, the more '90s you are in 2018. A big staple for '90s today is the baggy blue jean, which you can wear with a white tank top," she says. "The actual '90s was more extravagant—now, I think, it's less dramatized." 
  On Amelia: Jacket, Linder; Pants, Keith Lafuente; Shoes, Isa Tapia; Necklaces, Martine Ali; Right bracelet, Martine Ali; Right earring, Martine Ali; Sunglasses, Bonnie Clyde; Rings, Kota Okuda; Left bracelet, Kota Okuda; Left earring, Meiji Yang, Bag, Maison the Faux Colorful chain prints, particularly by maximalist fashion house Versace, ruled the day in the '90s, but what makes the retro look work today is mixing and matching saturated patterns of all types for an unexpected yet effortlessly chic vibe.  For example, take Corinne Foxx, actor Jaime Foxx's daughter, in this quilt-like dress, paired with a crochet bucket hat and platform Tevas. You might suspect all the colors here would clash, but this dress gives zero f*cks what you think about its many hues—it knows it's the bomb. It even convinced Corinne, 24. "I'm not super risky with my outfit choices," she says. "I'd normally balance a bold pattern with something subtle, like a jean, but I feel like a princess in this dress." Cairo Peele, daughter of '90s supermodel Bridget Peele, is also a recent convert to the fun-with-colors movement. She played with vibrant prints in a skintight vintage dress and diamond-patterned blouse. "I would't have said I'm a bold patterns type of gal," the 24-year-old says, "but today, after being in the look that I was in, I feel way more comfortable with it." 
  On Corinne: Dress, Rosie Assoulin; Necklace, Rosie Assoulin; Hat, Opening Ceremony; Bracelet, Xinye Jiang, Shoes, model's own; On Cairo: Shirt, vintage Todd Oldham from James Veloria; Dress, vintage Jean Paul Gaultier from James Veloria; Turtleneck, Ph5; Earrings, Wilky Way; Shoes, John Fluevog 
  Much of the decade's fashion had an ultra comfy, sporty thing going for it that's not too far afield from today's athleisure look. Pieces with activewear company logos scored style points with fashionistas back then, just as they do now. Amelia's scrunched blue skirt has a reflective, almost metallic coating. She wears it with a cropped, long-sleeve mock-neck top and a maroon fanny pack. And while Amelia's look is definitely more on the warm weather side of things, Ming Lee Simmons, daughter of model and fashion designer Kimora Lee Simmons, could honestly hit the slopes in hers.  The 18-year-old works her sporty side in a slate-blue mesh top with a denim-wash knit bikini and silver snow pants that "weren't actually as hot as you'd expect." As far as logos go, her favorite is the Baby Phat cat—an obvious choice, considering it's her mom's company. "We find it now on eBay, like the ones in the big hoop earrings." 
  On Amelia: Top, Jeremy Scott; Skirt, Priscavera; Bag, Philipp Plein; Earring, Georgina Trevino; Shoes, model's own; On Ming Lee: Shirt, Priscavera, Bra, Knorts; Pants, Philipp Plein, Jewelry, model's own; Shoes, model's own 
  Even though Clueless came out in 1995, Cher Horowitz's impact on fashion is still relevant today—plaids of all kinds, little mini skirts, and cropped cardigans have almost never gone out of style. But even if it's been years since you stepped foot in a high school (bc, like, why would you ever go back?), you can try the look for yourself—and luckily, you can do so without being a dead ringer for Cher in her now-costumey yellow outfit. Here, Cairo swaps Cher's brights for a darker print, knotting a vintage tee to switch things up. And she throws a cropped puffer cape over her shoulders—an obvious departure from a matching blazer. "I definitely wear the school-girl trend. It's my signature," she says. "I love wearing high platform Doc Martens with bunched-up socks, maybe with frayed or pleated denim and the Catholic-girl look where you tie your shirt at the bottom." Meanwhile, Atiana de la Hoya, daughter of famed boxer Oscar de la Hoya and model Shanna Moakler, prefers darker plaid pants, snakeskin boots, and a re-worked blouse. Her trick for nailing the era without looking dated: mixing vintage '90s pieces with staples from today.  "Taking a little bit from here and there really creates a whole new look," the 19-year-old says. "If you pair modern, basic pieces and with statement vintage styles from back then and make that the focus of your outfit, it really pulls everything together." 
  On Cairo: Cape, Fendi; Skirt, vintage Vivienne Westwood from James Veloria; Shirt, Goddess; Hat, Maison the Faux; Boots, Maryam Nassir Zadeh; Bracelet, Martine Ali; Earrings, Meiyi Yang; Rings, model's own; On Atiana: Shirt, Maison the Faux; Pants, Priscavera; Bra, Ph5; Boots, Fendi; Earrings, Earwack There was a time in the '90s when you couldn't go anywhere without seeing someone in a blinding minidress. By contrast, for some, it's hard to even imagine leaving the house—for any other purpose other than going to the clurb or a New Year's Eve party—in a metallic piece. Here, Amelia demonstrates how to make your day-to-day ensembles lit. Admittedly, the asymmetrical nature of her outfit is a tad OTT, but when you're serving baller looks, who cares?  If you still want to grab attention in something shiny but aren't sure if you can pull off silver separates, she suggests making one aspect of your outfit pop instead. "I would do a metallic skirt or a shoe but not the whole thing," she says. "This outfit is so cool, but toning it down for the real world may be necessary." One way to embrace this idea is through sparkly outerwear. Enter Corinne. She sparkles in a cracked chrome shearling coat over a velvety green tank that also picks up on the silvery vibes. The belt chain also brings the theme front and center. In her daily life, Corinne doesn't wear too many metals—except in jewelry—but she does admit she loves the look in a '90s-approved, night-on-the-town mini: "I'd style the dress with platform shoes—make it really '90s."

			 "We are determined to continue to make her beautiful work live on."  Kate Spade, who passed away last week by suicide, left behind a huge legacy in the fashion world, and it looks like she also left an arsenal of designs for her label Frances Valentine.  Her business partner Elyce Arons told Business Insider that Kate left them with approximately four seasons worth of ideas and "abundant library of her concepts." "We don't know what the future holds for us, but we are determined to continue to make her beautiful work live on through Frances Valentine. We will be stronger for her, more connected to each other through her," she said via email.  Kate left her namesake label in 2006 when she sold her remaining shares to Neiman Marcus. At the time, she wanted to focus on raising her daughter Frances Beatrix, who is now 13. She eventually returned to fashion when she founded Frances Valentine in 2015 with her husband Andy, along with business partners Elyce and Paola Venturi.  "We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and founder, Kate Valentine Spade, who will remain in our hearts forever," the brand posted on social media when Kate passed.  We are deeply saddened by the loss of our dear friend and founder, Kate Valentine Spade, who will remain in our hearts forever. pic.twitter.com/gWE7mnT2XH In the days since her passing, people all over the internet shared messages about the first Kate Spade bag they ever owned.

			 I wear ’em every day and have zero complaints.  If you were to ask anyone about my personal style, they’d tell you it’s “jeans everything.” Since childhood, I’ve found legit every opportunity to wear denim, no matter the occasion. Softball game? Jeans. Family get-together? Jeans. School dance? Jeans. I just love how they feel—so comfortable.  “No matter what you’re doing, there’s a pair of jeans for it.” —my life motto, actually So you may have guessed that I am always lookin’ out for new pairs to add to my growing collection, especially if they’re ~trendy~. Which is why I got super excited when I saw a colleague of mine wearing BDG’s Girlfriend Jeans from Urban Outfitters. I’ve never felt like I could pull off the looser-leg mom-jean thing. When I’ve tested the waters in the past, the extra room in the jeans always made me feel shorter than I really am, which is saying a lot considering I am just under 5 feet tall. But something about seeing my friend—who, I might add, is a whole foot taller than me—in this pair intrigued me.  After a few weeks of complimenting her outfits every time she wore the jeans, I finally convinced myself to go and try on a pair at the store. Once I had ’em on, I knew I’d found my dream denim. Now, I feel compelled to share the wealth with you.    Can't believe I only have two weeks left of my internship at @maybelline 😭it has been such an incredible experience to find my passion around such talented individuals and I am forever grateful. Thanks for everything @lorealusa 💥❤️💕📸 @sincerelyemmie A post shared by  Isabel Calkins (@isabelcalkins) on Jul 31, 2017 at 2:31pm PDT  Photo by Emma Vaughan Made out of cotton and spandex, these high-waisted bbs are ones I can actually breathe and move in while still having the structure of normal denim. Whether I’m sitting at a desk all day or out dancing with friends, the comfort level of these is insane. Oh, and the material makes my ass look incredible, in case you were interested in that lil detail. As I mentioned, my work friend who I saw wearing these has my total opposite body type. She is tall and lanky, and I am short. But because of the high-rise waist and slightly cropped length, these jeans work on literally everyone I have seen wearing them. And they have every size between 24 to 34. On my friend, the jeans ended a few inches above her ankle, and on me, right at the ankle (if I roll them once). Since I got these jeans, I have worn them to every occasion possible. You can dress them up for work with a pair of heels and a blouse, or for a night out with a cute tank and boots. They are as classic as you get—aka no matter how you wear them, you know you are going to look haaawt.  All caps because this is the absolute best part about these jeans: They. Are. Only. $69!!!  Honestly, I can’t find anything bad about these guys. Between the fit, style, and price tag, it really is a win all around. So yeah, you have all the info you need to live your best possible life in these jeans. Do with it what you will.

			 Color me obsessed. Some people have two sets of undies (sexy, not-so-sexy). I, on the other hand, have two sets of bras: those I wear most of the month and those I wear during my period, when my boobs inflate to twice their regular size like a pair of dense, jiggly hot-air balloons.  I can’t really get away with one set unless I want to spill out of my smaller, non-period bras and risk serious quad-boob. So when I scrolled upon an ad for Lively on my Instagram feed (was my phone listening to me grumble and moan about my boobies? Prob!!), I clicked through and discovered a magical world of super-affordable underthings. Founded by a former Victoria’s Secret employee, the direct-to-consumer brand also sells supersoft undies, PJs, workout ’fits, and swimwear. The only storefront (so far) is in New York City, but Lively’s return policy is easy and generous (because, um, have you ever found your perfect fit on the first try?).  I ordered a mesh-trim bralette in jet black for my non-period boobs and a busty bralette (Lively’s solution for the DD and DDD crew, aka me on my period) in navy color-block. I was immediately obsessed with how soft the material was—but that was only the beginning of my full-on love affair.   I love bralettes but have a hard time finding one that fits my narrow ribcage and also adequately supports ~the girls~. Lively’s busty option—which comes in a size 1, 2, or 3 based on your band and cup size—solved that. I swell up to a 32DD and ordered a 1. The band is thin and dainty but contains godly supportive elastic that doesn’t squeeze you, and the cups have a genius mesh panel on the interior that provides extra control, and oomph—a perfect solution for my period boobs. The mesh-trim bralette is even comfier—the band is sturdy but not as tight, and the cups are softer and less structured without the mesh panel. But in a medium, which fits my boobs better, I have to latch the band on the tightest hook—a no-no for a new bra. I love it all the same: It holds me in, feels like I’m wearing nothing at all, and is cute enough to wear under sheer shirts or tank tops. J’obsessed.  If neither of those are exactly your perfect boob savior, Lively has 41 different size variations, so your Goldilocks bra has gotta be in there somewhere.  I’d pay the million dollars I don’t have for a good-fitting bra, but luckily, Lively’s are only $35. It also pays to buy more than one—they’re $60 for two or $85 for three. It’s a literal genius way to make stocking up more affordable, because when was the last time you only needed one new bra?  Lively also has a loyalty program that gives points for every dollar you spend (10 = $1). You can rack up 100 real quick if you refer a friend, and creating an account also gives you another 100. I’ll do the math for ya: If you refer a friend and create an account, that’s 200 Lively points, aka $20(!) toward a bra.   I prefer to bra-shop online, because trying on in the comfort of my home is infinitely better than in a cramped dressing room with bad lighting. And Lively’s shipping and return process is super simple—any order over $40 ships free, and returns don’t cost a thing. Not that you’ll want to send them back but, ya know, just in case.   💥ONE PRICE FOR ALL💥 Sizes 38DDD-44DDD…Same high-style and comfort. Size Tax Free.💥 Coming sooner than you think!👀 . . Head to our IG Stories to get on the waitlist and share with your crew, loves!✨ #OnePriceForAll #livingLIVELY A post shared by  LIVELY (@wearlively) on Apr 3, 2019 at 2:07pm PDT I’m extremely insecure about how much my boobs grow on my period—like, please don’t make me leave the house–level insecure. Lively’s bralettes, especially the busty option, are the first I’ve tried that make me feel not only comfortable but also confident. If I could bottle that feeling and give it to everyone, I would! But the closest thing I can do is tell you to get your hands on these bras ASAP. You’ll wish you had so much sooner.

			 MY ANKLES ARE COLD! I am not out to get the cropped jean. I love them! I have some! But, it is winter, and my ankles are cold.  When I searched for flared and wide-leg denim in November I was astonished to learn that there were hardly ANY retailers who were selling styles that went all the way down—as in past your ankles to your feet. It's a pretty cold time of year, historically speaking, so that seemed crazy to me. With the holidays coming up, and a vacation in the new year, I put my search on hold, but I can report that there's *finally* a sufficient supply of non-cropped options now, thank God. What took ya so long, guys? Anyway, patience has paid off, so, if you are like me in that you don't want your lower legs to get frostbitten—and also you like wide-leg and flare pants—plz join me on my journey through all-the-way-down-pants land and shop below!

			 Don't put Baby in a bathing suit corner, y'all. My flight to Mallorca, Spain, was departing in less than 12 hours, and there I was, hunched over my suitcase, damning all my swimsuits straight to hell. They looked tired, worn down, and they fit poorly after repeat uses and washes. My three-day wardrobe was basically squared away, rolled into neat little clothing burritos Marie Kondo would have been proud of. Everything was all set...except for my swim styles. Why can’t I wear something else in the water?! my sleepy, late-night brain asked.  And, hey, yeah—why TF couldn’t I? With just hours to go till boarding my flight, I didn’t have the time—nor the mental (emotional?) energy—to deal with frustrating bikini shopping in fluorescent-lit fitting rooms. And no matter how fast Amazon Prime is, any online order I placed would never come quickly enough. So I decided not to bring a single “real” bathing suit.  Instead, I brought a black Knix bodysuit and cobbled together an activewear look (short bike shorts and a Lululemon workout tank with built-in bra) that I felt comfortable wearing and could pass for swimwear. As I zipped up my suitcase and hustled to the airport, I vaguely wondered if these stand-ins would take forever to dry or feel hot and suffocating. Also, um, what if the three hook-and-eye closures on the bodysuit’s crotch suddenly flew open?  Spoiler alert: That did not happen.  My delirious late-night packing “innovation” was a totally successful experiment—the bodysuit worked like a damn dream. I took two solo treks to local beaches, striding confidently into the glimmering Mediterranean sea to cool off and felt equally awesome when I took a quick dip in a swanky resort’s pool. I even wore it instead of a tank top, tucked into a high-waisted skirt, to sightsee around the unfamiliar city with my mostly forgotten high school–level fluency in Spanish. FYI, when I checked reviews on this bodysuit, I found out I wasn’t alone. Other people saw the swimwear potential in it too, and one fan apparently backpacked to 17 countries wearing only various Knix pieces to splash around in.   Can we talk about how amazing these ladies look?! The Every Bodysuit for EVERY body is now 20% off during our Mother's & Other's Sale🛍 Tap the photo to shop👆🏻 @100strongandsexy A post shared by  Knix (@knixwear) on Apr 26, 2019 at 1:54pm PDT The company’s founder and CEO, Joanna Griffiths, says the high-tech, breathable nylon-spandex fabric combo in their designs shortens drying time—oh, and it’s also anti-odor. “We’ve been sent photos of customers at the top of mountains, on remote islands, getting into their scuba gear, chilling poolside at high-end resorts in Miami, stand-up paddle-boarding—really, you name it!” she adds.  I’m excited to take my “bathing suit” out for tons of adventures before Labor Day (and beyond). It’s  in my suitcase right now, ready for whatever unlikely swim situations await me on my trip to Seattle and Colorado. It’ll likely become a staple at my parents’ lake house too.  This bodysuit is a lovely stand-in for a swimsuit if you’re in a pinch or don’t have tons of room in your suitcase and are traveling to a range of places. I don’t think I’ve given up on true bathing suits forever—especially since Knix launched its debut swimwear collection in May. I’m pretty pumped to try this similar V-neck one-piece and compare its fit, feel, and drying speed to my trusty faux suit. The main differences design-wise: The swim version is made from chlorine-resistant, UPF 50 fabric specifically made for the water, it has gold hardware, there’s more support, and the crotch closure liability is gone, per Griffith.  Oh, and as for activewear on the beach, I’m less sold. I wore the quickest-drying, techiest fabrics in my closet—nothing with too much cotton to avoid a drippy, wet-dog vibe—but it didn’t give off that same beachy mood. If you’re gonna use the stand-in method, a bodysuit, which more closely resembles an actual one-piece, is the better move.  👏🏻BEST.DAY.EVER👏🏻 Have you checked out our stories yet? Do it! We’re in Malibu, California today shooting for our new Knix Swim line with the help of some amazing women! Thanks for agreeing to spend the day with us @shannonnadj @luxuriousroxy @tabriamajors @thebirdspapaya @katiehwillcox @iamthedaisha and our lovely casting call winners @instantloss and Elizabeth!

Who knew my 3 a.m. brain was actually on to something?

			 Does this even surprise you? Last week, Twitter discovered that luxe fashion house Balenciaga — which, let's be honest, is kinda known for trolling everyone (remember the $2,145 IKEA knockoff?) — is selling a men's T-shirt with another button-down top pinned to the front for $1,290. Two tops for the price of... like, a lot more reasonably priced tops. LMAOOOOO bro what in the actual fuck pic.twitter.com/IsWSV0DMGD I thought this Balenciaga shirt was a joke. ...Its real and it's $1,290 pic.twitter.com/j0gwfmEaRS US$1,290 for this, @BALENCIAGA??! pic.twitter.com/aQwS2MFwwk I’ll slap anyone who even tries to tell me that this is dope, Balenciaga clearly doesn’t care 😭 pic.twitter.com/tLIZKffsHS There also was another, very similar style to the "T-Shirt Shirt," which was two button-downs sewn together (the "Double Shirt"). Balenciaga finessing you dickheads pic.twitter.com/IpfcM5t5VI Commenters soon discovered a women's version too, which sparked more confusion. When you can’t choose between two favorite shirts: Double Shirt. Ps: wtf?? pic.twitter.com/yGzjjXxHbR And, finally, people started to make their own T-shirt shirts and things really came full-circle. Hey @BALENCIAGA,I just made my own Double Shirt and it didn't cost thousands of dollars! pic.twitter.com/8daWqAGy7C OK, but: Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 OBSESSED.  Reformation’s style categories have expanded over the past few years, going from a sustainable clothing brand that offers just cute dresses and tops to one that also offers jeans, swimsuits, petite-size clothing, and children’s clothes. Last year in March, the company finally released a size-inclusive collection with model Ali Tate Cutler in sizes 0 to 22 and XS to 3X. However, the dresses, tops, and two-piece sets were only part of a capsule collection and disappeared from the website once they were sold out.  For those who were utterly bummed by this, not to worry, Reformation came back with even better news. Today, the beloved brand announced a permanent size-inclusive collection (!!!). What you can expect from this line: 18 of Reformation’s best-selling styles, including tops, bodysuits, skirts, and dresses (with new things added monthly) starting at $48. The size range is 1X to 3X and 14 to 24. The pieces are currently available to shop on Reformation and will also be at Nordstrom March 29.  Since Ref’s extended-sizing collection isn’t going anywhere, take comfort in the fact that you’ll have access to crisp white dresses and daisy-print skirts until the end of summer. Below, our favorite pieces to wear for tropical vacations, brunches, and beyond.

			 She made an interesting choice considering it's middle of July.  Today, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry left for their first international tour when they hopped over to Dublin to pay a visit to some government pals. When they landed, Meghan stunned in a green outfit, but there's more to this look than meets the eye.  People originally reported and tweeted that she was wearing a forest green Givenchy dress.  Meghan is wearing an appropriately forest green Givenchy dress for her royal Dublin debut   #RoyalVisitIreland pic.twitter.com/B5TWimHlu6 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - looking amazing in a forest green Givenchy dress - leave Dublin airport ahead of a meeting the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar #RoyalVisitIreland 🇮🇪 pic.twitter.com/QnkFMT3PK2 Landed in Dublin! #MeghanMarkle has landed in Ireland for the #RoyalVisitIreland, in a green dress with a brown handbag. 😍 pic.twitter.com/4f3GuFYybE When you look closer, though, you can tell it's actually a skirt and sweater, NOT a dress.  It's really easy to tell in this picture in particular.    Sneaky, huh? The outfit is definitely Givenchy, the same designer who made her now-famous wedding dress, but it's two separate pieces. This almost seems weird considering it is the middle of July, which is definitely more dress weather than #sweaterweather, but hey! Who are we to judge? The girl knows clothes.  This is the second time in two days that Meghan's rocked a shade of green. Yesterday, she wore olive Ralph Lauren to her nephew Prince Louis's christening.  Green was one of Meghan's go-to colors before her wedding to Prince Harry, but she actually hasn't worn the color since the wedding until this event yesterday. Back in April when people first noticed the habit, royal expert Rob Shuter told Yahoo Lifestyle that it's probably an intentional choice. "Second to blue, green is the most popular shade for women in Britain,” he said. “Meghan might be sending the message that she’s really no different than anyone else.” SHOP A SIMILAR TOP Banana Republic Merino Flutter-Sleeve Sweater, $68 SHOP A SIMILAR SKIRT Banana Republic Ponte Midi Pencil Skirt, $78 Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 All of the springy looks! If you have any friends who are getting married in the near future, they're probably going to invite you to a bridal shower.

			 Hello? Anyone?!    "What is the reason for this abomination?" is something you might think if you take a gander at Ukrainian-based brand Ksenia Schaider's unique asymmetrical denim, or as I like to call them, Franken-jeans. One side is wide-legged, and the other is straight—and while it evokes a certain ~vibe~, I wasn't convinced it was mine. Schnaider's reconstructed denim pieces have gained popularity among the likes of Bella Hadid, Dua Lipa, and the general fashion influencer set, but when these were released in February, they quickly went viral for very obvious reasons.    ASYMMETRIC JEANS A post shared by  KSENIASCHNAIDER (@kseniaschnaider) on Jan 7, 2019 at 7:19am PST Go home fashion, you're drunk   That's not a fashion trend, it's a mistake.  According to Vogue, Ksenia (who heads the label with her husband Anton) based the pants on two of their best-selling styles, combining them into one design. Genius? Absurd? You decide. Naturally, upon seeing them, my first thought was, "Wow, I'd love to wear these IRL to see people's hilarious reactions," and the whole Cosmo fashion team agreed.    When they came a few weeks later, I put them on—one leg into the skinny hole and the other into the wide one—and man, did they feel just as odd as they looked. My initial observations when glancing in the mirror? They were so long that I had to wear heeled boots so they wouldn't drag on the floor, and compared to the breezy feeling of the looser side, the more tapered one made my other leg feel claustrophobic. Plus, there was the fact that I just looked so...lopsided. I seriously dreaded going outside, thinking of all the stares I was about to get and fully expecting someone to come up to me and ask, "What the f*ck are you wearing?!" (It is New York City.)  "You're going to be embarrassed to be seen with me, huh?" I asked my boyfriend Max, who sometimes has Strong Opinions about my more adventurous 'fits. But his reaction was more of a shrug. "They're really fine," he said. Wearing the Jeans in the Wild I committed to our Sunday plan, which was heading to Willamsburg, Brooklyn, together, grabbing coffee and reading at a café, and then going to a movie theater to see Greta (don't befriend lonely old ladies, folks!).  When I finally mustered up the confidence to venture outside, it wasn't nearly as terrible as I thought. Sure, I did get *some* odd looks on the subway and while walking around, but that was really it.  The longer I wore the jeans, the less I thought about them. While I was wondering why people weren't commenting on them or blatantly staring with a confused look on their face, it dawned on me: Duh, I'm in Brooklyn, and this is probably the least unusual ensemble these folks have seen today.   When we got to the coffee shop where one of my most outspoken friends works, he didn't notice either. All day, I waited for someone to be offended by my choice of jeans, but other than the minimal staring, there were zero reactions. I walked to the movie theater, took the subway back home, went to the grocery store, and...nada. No questions. No whispers. No funny comments. Nothing. "Maybe they're not as strange as I thought?" I wondered.  Okay, But Would I Wear 'Em Again? What I initially envisioned as a funny fashion experiment took an unexpectedly deep turn: It was a classic case of the "Spotlight Effect." I was so self-conscious at the beginning of the day, walking around in these two-in-one jeans, but when it finally came time to take them off, I realized probably nobody else thought about them as much as I did. In other words: We pay way too much attention to what we think other people notice about us, and in reality, the things we're so insecure about aren't even crossing their minds. Hell. Yes. So did I did learn a valuable lesson in psychology? Totally. Will I wear these jeans again? Absolutely not.

			 Can Kate please bring her springy vibes across the pond? It is snow-storming (YET AGAIN, OMG) on the east coast and I'm going to go ahead and say definitively that the only thing bringing anyone any joy or color right now are these photos of Kate Middleton in a bright, springy outfit at a Royal Foundation symposium on childhood mental health on Wednesday: For the event, the Duchess of Cambridge, who is expecting her third child in April, wore a light green jacket with a delicate bow detail and a knee-length dress by one of her go-to designers, Jenny Packham. She accessorized with green amethyst earrings and neutral pumps and generally glowed. Why can't winter just take a hint from Kate's clothing cues and leave already?

			 My unfiltered thoughts and feelings about the sweatshirt that goes with everything. There’s something about a comfy silhouette in a chic color and a simple design that makes me want to spend all of my money. Throw a chic phrase on it, such as “C’est la vie,” and I’m buying one in every color.  Luckily, the people that brought me my new favorite sweatpants are now selling one of the chicest hoodies under $20 I’ve ever had the pleasure of wearing: The SweatyRocks Women's Letter Print Long Sleeve Crop Top Sweatshirt Hoodies. (What regal title!) Here’s why I’m obsessed.   While scoping out the athleisure situation on Amazon, I noticed that this hoodie had an unusually high number of reviews (213 by the time this was published) and a 4.2 star rating, so I bought one!  The general consensus from customers is that this lil cropped hoodie is decent quality and looks more $$ than it is, which (as we know) is ideal.  That said, lots of people wrote that they ordered a size up so their hoodie wouldn't be too cropped. So, obvi, I did the same and ordered a medium. I probably could have gone with a small because I don’t mind a serious crop situation. But the medium fits perfectly baggy and only showed by belly when I raised my arms, as crop tops do.  Truly, there is a shade here for everyone. That’s probably why like half of the reviews are from people who plan to buy other hues. Catch ‘em all here: 
 My favorite way to justify a purchase is “it goes with everything!” And this checks that box. I chose the khaki color because it was a chic neutral that’s a little more forgiving than white. (Note to self: You are not responsible enough for white clothes. Stop lying to yourself.) The soothing neutral shade went with 90 percent of the stuff in my closet, including fancy pants, jeans, and leggings. But no matter what color you get, the style is the perfect combo of casual and chic. So feel free to dress her up or down depending on your vibe.  This 100 percent polyester beauty is super lightweight. And as many reviewers point out, this makes the top feel more like a long sleeve tee that happens to have a hood attached. If you’re looking for some serious warmth, you won’t find it here. But if you’re traveling or between seasons, this hoodie is kind of ideal because the sleeves easily fit into the tightest leather jackets (including one I recently bought to wear over sleeveless tops). And because the hood is so thin and lightweight, you can keep it in your jacket or pull it out to look as chill as you’ll feel. Voila!

			 She paired it with Ugg slippers, FYI. Tiffany Haddish is a woman of her word. Back in November, she went on SNL wearing the same dress she wore to the premiere of the movie Girls Trip. In the monologue, she promised that it wouldn't be the last time you'd see her in the gown, because she'd paid actual money for it — like a lot of actual money, as it is an Alexander McQueen number — and it would be crazy to wear it only once. Anyway, she just wore that same dress while presenting at the 2018 Oscars. Girl, yes!! Here she is in the outfit, which she says cost her $4,000, at the Academy Awards: Just an FYI — she paired it with Ugg slippers. Major props for that. Here she is in the dress (two separate times) on SNL: once during the monologue and again during Weekend Update. Here she is wearing it to the Girls Trip premiere. And, finally, here's what she said about the dress, from SNL: Well said, girl. Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBeauty.

			 Namaslay. If you're about to get your downward dog on in a major way, you may be looking for cute yoga outfit inspiration and, boy, have you come to the right place. Keep scrollin' to see some seriously stylish activewear that'll make all that studio time feel fresh as hell. Tactile person? You'll love the feel of this eggplant bra and leggings set with matching velvet trim.  You'll be the flyest person in your yoga class in this dotted neutral bra and leggings combo—but the medium impact sports bra means you can also wear this to another gym class, no prob. Plus, aren't these black and pink shoes cool? Coordinating is your thing, so make sure to grab this jacket and tights combo in these cool purple hues, pairing with a maroon tee and white sneaks for the perfect low-key-but-still-looks-like-you-tried aesthetic.  This ribbed longline piece is a top and sports bra all in one and it's cool pattern means it will make any of your gym outfits instantly cooler. I'm partial to wearing it with these matching knit-look shorts for a hot yoga class or a flow session on the beach on your next vacation.  Some people just aren't into the tapered look of a traditional running tight, and if that's you, you'll love this marled high-waisted flare and wrap-effect sports bra look. Sexy 'lil details do it for you? Then you'll love this pair of shorts with mesh paneling on the sides. Let them speak for themselves by pairing with a simple black sports bra and matching sneakers. If the thought of putting a whole outfit together seems daunting, why not try a unitard? This red halter one moves with you and features a pretty laser-cut detail at the bustline. Statement pieces attract you, which is why you shouldn't shy away from an eye-popping black and white sports bra like this one. Pair with charcoal leggings and neutral sneakers and you've got yourself a getup. Sometimes, basic black is too boring, but colors also seem like a bit too much. Compromise with a shiny V-neckline sports bra and leggings paired with a white jacket and gray gym bag. Your sweat session of choice is super intense and intentionally warm, so you want to wear as little as possible. Consider this cute color-blocked sports bra and semi high-waisted short shorts for your next class in the heat. Back at it again with the one-pieces! If you aren't big on flashy colors and designs but love the freeing feel of wearing a onsie, go for something like this crisp white heathered style. Classic neutrals like navy and beige with stripes gives off a major retro vibe, and if that feels like you, please go ahead and cop this cami and leggings combo and feel free to pair with black kicks, if you want!  Trying to keep things light? Go for sky blues and blushy-beiges in these color-blocked, mesh-paneled stirrup leggings. Pair with a classic matching muscle tee to complete the style. A pair of comfy shorts with a supportive cami is definitely a great yoga outfit, but it's also the best thing to wear while lounging around at home, just sayin'. If turning heads at the gym is your goal, you should definitely consider this blue-and-white set of a sports bra and leggings for your next yoga class. Another great hot yoga option, right this way! A color-blocked longline sports bra and matching shorts will keep you supported while still cooled down (as much as possible) in the heated space. It doesn't get more classic than a gray sports bra and black leggings—though these ones have an added sexy mesh panel running down the sides! In case there's crappy weather (like rain or a ton of wind) on the way to your gym, consider this outfit, which consists of a cute, semi-see-through windbreaker, some bike shorts, and a strappy sports bra. You definitely earned your post-gym snuggle session with your couch and blanket, so why not capitalize on it with a cute otufit of a turtleneck sweatshirt and marled leggings?

			 Colette LeClair of @Colette.Prime is the answer to all your cheap-clothing needs, FYI. Colette LeClair is on a busy NYC sidewalk struggling to weave three unwieldy full-size suitcases through a throng of business-lunchers, tourists, and delivery people. It’s awkward. It’s clunky. And yet, in her houndstooth jumpsuit and faux-fur-collar coat, she looks fabulous doing it. The scene is reminiscent of the high-low advertisements where women wear gowns and jewels to the laundromat because they have nothing left to put on for laundry day.  
  Thing is, Colette’s not on her way to do laundry, and she actually has plenty to wear, much of which is stuffed into those three suitcases. And while most of those pieces are pretty glamorous-looking, they happen to be super inexpensive too. In just a year and a half blogging as @Colette.Prime, Colette has amassed more than 25,000 followers—not because she plays coy for the camera like other fashionistas, smiling shyly while looking away and spinning in a patterned maxidress, but because the *only* clothes she ever wears on her feed (and IRL) come from Amazon. (By the way, she was on her way to this photo shoot with that luggage, and all the clothes you see here are pieces she actually owns from the major online retailer.)   “I wore Amazon clothes when I was in college at Clemson, and I wore Amazon suits to my job interviews,” the 27-year-old Virginia native tells me during our interview at SixtyLES downtown. “I wore Amazon to work every day as an accountant in San Francisco.” (Colette quit that accounting gig in December, when she decided to make fashion blogging her full-time thing.) Colette’s obsession started because the closest mall to Clemson was 30 minutes away, and it was just too damn far for the then-student. “I had a very small budget, a Prime membership, and a computer. That meant I could get cheapish things shipped for free, which was better than Forever 21 and other online stores could offer,” she says. “It worked and I could afford it—I was like, ‘This is fun and I’m broke.’”  Colette’s growing number of followers is proof that people are more keen to shop for clothing on Amazon than they were even a few years ago. “Everyone was always like, ‘Oh, weird that you buy clothes there, but you look pretty cute,’” she says.     While she’s an “influencer,” she doesn’t act the same way other bloggers with high Instagram follower counts do. She does post cool snaps in dreamy duds, but that’s where the similarities end.  No Instagram husbands here—Colette plays with lighting and photography all on her own and uses a tripod to snap her photos. And she’s not afraid of color: While many fashionistas cool down and flatten the tones in their pics, Colette wears neons and in-your-face reds, and she takes pictures in unexpected outside locations and inside on colorful backgrounds. The result is more editorial photo shoot, less “candid” street shot.  Colette’s fans are more like clients, coming to her with questions only she can address. “I’ll get requests like, ‘Hey! Can you shop for me for this wedding I have coming up? I need the dress to be under $50 and red,’” she says. “So I’ll spend four hours finding them 10 dresses in their size. They may or may not buy one, but they’ll tell all their friends.” Other Insta-famous personalities get paid to promote things in their feeds or on their Stories, or maybe they make appearances or participate in partnerships with various brands. Colette, however, is part of the Amazon Influencer program, meaning she gets a small percentage of whatever items end up in your Amazon cart if you follow her link to get there. All those DMs? Also part of her cut. That means she’s motivated to find things her fans will actually want to click through and buy—even if they’re not necessarily her vibe—rather than just post pretty pics, hoping you’ll engage with her by dropping *fire* emojis in the comments.  Although she won’t disclose how much money she earns, Colette says she waited to become a full-time blogger until she knew she could cover her living costs with the check she receives from the retailer for all those post-click purchases. Amazon also sends a gift card every month for new clothes, which helps offset work expenses.   On it, she highlights her favorite pieces and groups them by type, destination, or occasion, so even the masses—who are less into DMing and more into lurking—can get in on the affordable action. Obviously, although she tries to answer each and every personal message, she can’t possibly respond to everyone. In fact, she’s typically able to get back to only about half of them, and that’s with spending roughly 20 hours a week shopping for followers and responding to DMs. Thankfully, most people’s inquiries—for floor-length gowns, resort wear, coats, graduation dresses, and more—can be answered through her page, to which she is always adding.   Basically, she puts in the damn hours. “I have been doing this for a long time, so by now, I have a list of about 40 brands [which you can see on her site] that are my go-tos—they’ve consistently delivered cute stuff,” Colette says.   If you’ve ever looked for anything on Amazon, you’ve probably noticed it can be hard to search for a specific phrase and find the exact thing you want. “Once I search through pages and pages of options and actually find something good, if it is from a brand I don’t recognize, I’ll buy it myself to determine the quality before ever recommending it to a follower,” Colette says. This happens on a monthly basis, meaning she’s amassed a huuuge wardrobe. She devotes a floor of her apartment to her work, and it includes a photography studio, five clothing racks, a few dressers, and lots of shoe storage. To manage the inevitable garment overflow, she donates to a hospital in her hometown of Richmond, Virginia, and does regular giveaways on her Stories.  The quality-control aspect of her work doesn’t end with finding amazing items, by the way. If an otherwise great piece is up on her site and falls apart after a few wears, she’ll take it off her list right away and warn you about it. “I want to be able to say that a sweater lasted 10 washes, or it didn’t,” she says.  Follow Colette’s quick-and-dirty tricks to snatch up some real good finds: Goes without saying, but on the other hand, how many of you actually do your due diligence on this front? Colette sticks to labels with four or more stars, and if something doesn’t have any or many reviews, she’ll click through the brand’s review history—that gives her a good sense of whether the line is consistent about its quality.    “I’ve been doing this a long time, and I’m pretty good at spotting different kinds of materials,” Colette says. “If the description of the item says ‘100 percent polyester velvet’ and the picture makes it look like high-quality silk velvet, I will discount it.” That’s not a neg on polyester, FYI—she’s down for synthetic fabrics, she just doesn’t like being deliberately misled by pictures. “If the brand is willing to describe the item and how to handle it, it is more likely to be trustworthy,” she says. “For example, a pair of leggings that I love reads, ‘Cool-wash your leggings with like colors and lay flat to dry. Remember not to heat dry!’ A good description like this tells me the brand cares about the item.” And following detailed instructions will keep the piece in its best condition for the longest possible time and prevent wear, like pilling, stretching out, and holes.  Anyway, you ~could~ go through this entire process to find something you need for yourself—or you could just ask her to do it for you. Pretty sure she’d be happy to help.

			 They honestly go with everything. As a self-described Short Girl with tiny-ass feet, one of my biggest struggles is buying shoes that fit and are still comfortable, stylish, and have the right amount of lift. And, since I live in New York City and walk literally everywhere, all the time, it’s nearly impossible to find footwear that checks all those boxes and doesn’t fall apart in two months.  That’s why I was so, so excited when a friend of mine posted about her Everlane Heel Boots. They had everything I look for with quality materials to boot (pun intended, sorry). She also mentioned that they’re super durable, which sealed the deal...I obviously had to shamelessly copy her style. After reading her testimony, I immediately went to the Everlane showroom in Soho and tried a pair on for myself. Not to be dramatic or anything, but that was the moment my life changed forever.   If you're feee today come stop by the @everlane showroom to buy these awesome boots AND to see @laurasupnik make some awesome art. LEGGO. A post shared by  Isabel Calkins (@isabelcalkins) on Feb 11, 2017 at 11:45am PST You’re prob wondering what makes these better than any other pair. Let me break it down for you. Scroll on, plz.    Black boots are generally pretty easy to dress up and down, but the best part about Everlane’s “The Heel Boot” is in its name: the heel. Their two-inch height is enough to pull off at a fancier event, which is something I do on the reg, but low enough to run from errand to errand throughout my day-to-day life. Whether I am going to the office in a wrap dress or jeans or just out and about at a bar on a Saturday night, these. boots. work.  happiest surrounded by books all under a dollar A post shared by  Isabel Calkins (@isabelcalkins) on Apr 18, 2019 at 10:34am PDT As long as you follow Everlane’s instructions of treating the boot with leather-protectant spray, these bad boys will get you through rain or shine. Or, in my case: sleet, sludge, and that weird gray-green liquid I sometimes see on my block.   Literally obsessed with these new pieces from @landsend - especially the Squall Duffle Coat. Since my parents just moved to Seattle, I’m going to need a coat that handles ALL the elements, not just rain. Oh and it doesn’t hurt that it’s my absolute favorite color. #mylandsend #landsendwinterbreak #AD @internqueen 📸 @kyle.pinsky A post shared by  Isabel Calkins (@isabelcalkins) on Nov 20, 2017 at 2:03pm PST I’ve had trouble finding something teensy enough to fit my small feet in the past, but this boot ranges from 5 to 11, including half sizes. And if black isn’t your color, it also comes in four other neutral, wear-’em-with-anything shades.  One of the best things about Everlane is its focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly design and processes. Meaning, they only produce their products at ethical factories around the world and only source the finest materials. I didn’t know any of this when I first saw my friend’s Instagram about these bbs, but it definitely made my decision to purchase easier. I wouldn’t normally buy a $235 boot, but given all that ethical, eco-friendly stuff above, I'm willing to make the investment, particularly because these boots really do L-A-S-T. I’ve worn them 300-days-a-year for three years straight and am still on my first pair. For me, a 23-year-old working her first job on an entry-level paycheck, the decision to add these boots to cart—given the price—wasn’t one I made easily. But I can confidently tell you that it was one of the best buys I ever made. Really, the only times that I don’t wear these are when the hottest days of the summer threaten to turn my feet into melted pools of skin and bones (fun!). But when that’s not the case, the versatility of this boot means I have an option that works for any occasion and that definitely won’t fall apart for years to come.

			 Meghan never met her mother-in-law, but that doesn't mean she hasn't been inspired by her fashion sense.  Since joining the royal family, Meghan Markle has been a fashion inspiration to women around the world with her chic, modern looks. But who is her style icon? Even though Meghan never had the chance to meet Prince Harry's mom, Princess Diana, their aesthetic choices can look eerily similar. Here are their best twinning moments.  Pastel pink is a favorite color among royals (just ask Kate Middleton). Diana wore this skirt-suit, with button detailing down the front while in Argentina in November 1995. Meghan wore a similar number for her first ever Trooping the Colour (the Queen's birthday celebration) on June 9, 2018. It was her second post-wedding appearance, and she accessorized the custom Carolina Herrera dress with a  Philip Treacy hat.  Princess Diana wore this all-black suit to attend the memorial of photographer Terence Donovan in March 1997. For members of the royal family, wearing head-to-toe black is (typically) reserved for funerals. Meghan wore this navy suit to the Endeavor Fund Awards in February 2018. Fun fact: She paired it with a white blouse that's actually a bodysuit. Camel = classic, which Diana proved here in a jacket/skirt combo situation in November 1982. Look at that smile! She's like, "yes, I know, my outfit is divine."  For Christmas services with the Queen, Meghan wore an updated version of Diana's outfit, complete with a camel coat, brown suede boots, a brown fascinator, brown leather gloves, and a brown leather purse. Now *that* is commitment to a theme. This whole outfit cost more than $10,000, in case you were curious! The '90s were a magical time in which women wore denim-on-denim like it was no big thing, as proven by Princess Diana here in March 1993 with William and Harry during a ski trip. Meghan fully channeled the Canadian tuxedo here in chambray shorts and blazer combination in March 2016. She was at a Today show taping in New York City. This was way before she was royal, duh.  And now for a major throwback: Here's Diana at 10 years old during a summer holiday in 1971, already a fashion trailblazer, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat.  Meghan wore a similar style when she attended Anzac Day services with Prince Harry in April 2018.  Here, Princess Diana goes full-on Victorian era in a velvety green dress with a matching hat. She wore this in November 1983 and looked quite darling.  Meghan went with a shorter design and a different silhouette, but still in a textured green fabric. The color, BTW, appears to be one of the Duchess' favorites. This photo is from September 2013. Ever heard of a "revenge dress?" While her ex-husband, Prince Charles, was admitting on national television that he had cheated on her, Princess Diana was busy having a good time in this short, black number.  This was in June 1994, btw.  For the London Global Gift Gala in November 2013, Meghan wore this strapless black dress, which also had detailing around the left hip, just like Diana's. Diana wore this plaid blazer with a matching skirt, featuring a pattern specific to the royal family called the Prince of Wales Check (also known as glen plaid). She wore it in May of 1988. Meghan wore the same pattern in Cardiff, Wales in January 2018, but as a structured jacket rather than a traditional blazer, and she opted for black jeans instead of a skirt.  This strapless white Catherine Walker design looked absolutely beautiful on Diana during her official visit to Hungary in May 1980. Hey, doesn't this gown kind of remind you of... ...Meghan's reception dress, which was also white, form-fitting, floor-length, with bare shoulders, and *oh* so pretty. Stella McCartney made this specifically for Meghan's May 2018 festivities. In the U.K., the poppy is a sign of remembrance that people wear to commemorate lives lost in military service. Diana wore this black outfit, including a double-breasted coat, hat, and veil, with her floral pin in November 1988.  To attend Anzac Day services (part two), Meghan opted for a skirt, cropped blazer, hat, and of course, the poppy in April 2018.  Never one to shy away from a true ~lewk~, Diana channeled an IRL disco ball with this silver dress. She wore it to a movie premiere in November 1985. The CFDA Fashion Awards are a ~who's who~ of the fashion scene every single year, and Meghan wore this all-silver number when she attended the event in November 2015. Her good friend Misha Nonoo designed the look.  Diana gave the world a lesson in the right way to wear stripes in July 1985 when she opted for this bold jacket-and-skirt combo. Meghan made the ensemble feel more modern and casual in July 2016 by opting for shorts instead of a skirt and an open rather than closed blazer, complete with a T-shirt underneath.  Diana knew how to wear lace, and this all-white, curve-hugging halter dress, which she wore in September 1996, is just one example.  Meghan's short lace number is equally as pretty. She was attending Self magazine's Rock the Summer Event in New York City in July 2013. Head-to-toe pinstripes is not easy to pull off, but Diana pulled it together in a classic coat dress with a dapper lil white hat in April 1985.  Meghan's pinstripes look had a higher slit up the front and a matching belt. She also draped a blazer oh-so-casually over her shoulders to complete the look, which she wore in April 2018.   A white coat makes a statement, which Diana proved with this Versace design that she wore in January 1996. Meghan has worn a white coat on more than one occasion. The first was when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement to the world, and the second was to attend Commonwealth Day services with Prince Harry in March 2018, where she kind of twinned with Kate Middleton, too!

			 Your jaw will drop when you see Amal's full look.  After what felt like years leading up to the royal wedding, the day finally came, and guests flocked to Windsor Castle to attend the nuptials of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on Saturday afternoon. Here, a look at all the best-dressed royal wedding attendees.  The mother of the bride looked beautiful in a pastel custom Oscar de la Renta dress and coat and Aquazzura shoes.  Friends of the bride, Abigail and Priyanka, looked absolutely polished in polka dots and pastel, respectively.  Serena attended with her husband Alexis Ohanian wearing an Atelier Versace dress with an asymmetrical neckline, Bulgari jewelry, and a statement fascinator.  Carey was spotted with her husband Marcus Mumford in a bright citrus-colored floral maxi dress with grey suede pumps.  Wearing a preppy navy, white, and red Gucci ensemble, Sabrina was glowing alongside her fiancé Idris Elba.  The Suits actress stunned in a bold red maxi dress with three-quarter length sleeves and completed her look with a hat, clutch, and neutral heels.  Meghan Markle's Suits co-star wore a navy, midi dress with embellished, dramatic sleeves and a matching veil.  Oprah went with a blush pink monochromatic look, wearing a tiered midi dress by Stella McCartney, pumps, a top handle bag from Gabriela Hearst, and a flawless church hat.  Pippa Middleton came to the ceremony with her husband, James Matthews, wearing a mint green floral dress by The Fold London with a pleated skirt and strappy shoes. It marked the first time she was spotted with her baby bump – she's reportedly four months pregnant.  Victoria Beckham wore a deep blue midi dress of her own design with slits on her sleeves and bright pumps, while her husband David looked positively dashing in his three-piece grey and black suit.  Giada walked to the ceremony in an aqua coat and dress with a matching church hat.  Jacinda, with her husband Gabriel Macht who's on Suits, looked gorgeous in a burgundy dress with a keyhole cutout and black accessories.  Amal stunned in this canary-yellow Stella McCartney dress with a matching hat and metallic Gianvito Rossi shoes. George picked up on the yellow cue by wearing a lighter version of the shade on his tie and pocket square.  Prince Harry's ex was invited to the royal affair and chose a navy knee-length dress with a capelet.  Kate Middleton really can do no wrong – she wore this dress (which she's worn at least two other times before!) with neutral pumps and a floral fascinator, while her daughter Charlotte wore a short sleeve A-line dress. So cute!  The princess looked chic in a light blue sheath dress and a classic pillbox hat.  Eugenie's older sister, Princess Beatrice also wore a shade of blue, but her version was a teal tea-length dress with sheer sleeves and a headpiece similar to what she wore at the Met Gala earlier this month.

			 Sorry to this man my wallet.  You know you need more comfy sweaters (or you’re at least convincing yourself you do), and that’s where Amazon’s fall fashion deals come in. Now through November 21, there are tons of discounts happening on the retailer’s own brands plus sales on THE Amazon coat; 15 percent off bras, underwear, and sleepwear; 70 percent off women’s clothing; and a LOT more.

It has an almost perfect 5-star rating and a roomy batwing silhouette for layering. A lace-trim cold-shoulder shirt is perfect for fall and winter since it has more coverage, but it’s also dressy enough for a festive party. A pair of waterproof boots with more than 150 reviews and an almost perfect 5-star rating is definitely going to get use once snow hits. You get two accessories for the price of one with a hat and matching circular knit scarf. It has more than 70 5-star reviews with comments saying it’s warm, comfortable, and v cute. Zip yourself up in this Sherpa jacket that is cozy and gives off those winter vibes. It also comes in gray and a dusty rose if those are more your colors. A blouse with a bow at the neck and some extra ruffles will definitely stand out from your other tops. Select Hush Puppies footwear is 20 percent off, and this black pair with contrast trim is a staple for any fall wardrobe.

Need some new shoes in your life? Opt for a leopard-print pair that’ll go with just about anything. Plus, your feet will also stay in place because of the secure buckle. Whether you want an initial necklace for yourself or for a friend, a rose-gold one looks so stylish on its own or layered with more pieces. This style has over 500 reviews and more than 4 stars, so the people have spoken. If you are looking for a slightly oversize shirt to binge Netflix in or need a sweater for layering, this is the one. PVC bags are trending, so treat yourself to one without dropping a ton of dough with this cute style. It’s available in a bunch of other hues, too, and the beige colorway is less than $10, folks! Since you can take 15 percent off bras, underwear, and sleepwear from Amazon brands, maybe it’s finally time to upgrade your pj’s? This nightshirt looks more elevated with its contrasting piping, but it’s still comfy enough for bed. I’m sold.

			 Dang, my feed is sneaky. After repeatedly dismissing subtle nudges from advertising gods who think they know me better than I know myself, I finally caved. I bought shoes from the brand that’s been low-key lurking on my feed every time I check the ’gram. I’m usually adamant about ignoring companies that spam me, but Rothy’s finally wore me down to the point that I was actually intrigued by its woven shoes claiming to be made from water bottles! Full disclosure: It wasn’t until I saw a blogger friend of mine wearing Rothy’s slip-on sneakers that I thought to myself, Mayyybe these are actually cool. So basically, it’s the brand’s fault that I didn’t drink its sustainable Kool-Aid sooner. It had been showing me a pair of round-toe ballet flats (not quite my vibe) for the longest time, and that’s all I assumed it made, until I saw my friend sporting her cool kicks. That’s when I was like, “Sign me up!”   Here’s what makes alllll its shoes so, so good, friends. Knowing that I don’t have to tiptoe around to preserve the pristine white soles on my sneakers means I basically wore them all summer long—with jeans, dresses, and shorts. If they started to show any scuffs or dirt, I threw them into the wash and they came out looking all fresh and clean. And because I wear them sockless, the minute I detect any foot sweat or odor, I pop the insoles into the wash, and voilà—fresh as daisies.  Perfect beach kicks: slip-on sneakers that can go straight into the washing machine after a sand-filled adventure. 📷 @shhtephs A post shared by  Rothy's (@rothys) on Apr 17, 2019 at 3:49pm PDT While the slip-on sneakers were the first to speak to me, I’m also a fan of the loafers (I got a pair in neutral animal print). Rothy’s also makes round-toe and pointy flats in a variety of prints, camos, and solid colors like navy, black, linen, red, and a few shades of millennial pink. It’s even got kids’ loafers and sneakers if you have a mini-me you want to twin with or if you need a stylish gift for the under-10 set. 
  Peace out, heels. Hello, comfort. 📷 @noelleandfox A post shared by  Rothy's (@rothys) on Mar 26, 2019 at 3:52pm PDT  Whether your foot is narrow or on the wider side, the shoe’s woven fibers have some give that allow for a little flexibility in sizing. I’m usually a 7.5 or an 8, and I wear a 7.5 in Rothy’s because they’ve got that added stretch factor. Since its inception three years ago, Rothy’s has taken more than 30 million plastic bottles and repurposed them into (surprisingly chic) shoes. Using plastic chips that it turns into pellets and then spools of thread, the shoes come in every color of the rainbow. Even the soles are made from recyclable, vegan rubber and the insoles are made from recycled materials too.   It’s #EarthMonth (our favorite month!). You probably know we divert plastic water bottles from landfills to create beautiful shoes. Here’s a peek into part of the process! ♻️ A post shared by  Rothy's (@rothys) on Apr 1, 2019 at 11:57am PDT Okay, shopping on Instagram might not be the best habit to cultivate, but I’m sure happy I decided to pull the trigger on my slip-ons and my loafers. One note of caution: Once you start, you may not be able to stop buying these shoes in all the styles and colors available. I mean, I ended up with two pairs! At a price range of $125 to $145, these aren’t the cheapest shoes you can find, but at least they’re good for the planet, they’re comfortable, AND you can keep them looking brand-spankin’-new for a really long time.

			 For starters, it's by a French fashion house.  Um, so in case you missed it, Meghan Markle just showed up to Windsor Chapel for her freaking wedding to Prince Harry in a drop-dead gorgeous Givenchy gown with a super long veil. But while front-runners of her wedding dress design included Ralph & Russo, Burberry, Erdem, and Stella McCartney – all British designers – Givenchy came WAY out of left field. Typically, royal brides choose a British designer to showcase local talent and give a boost to the British economy, but while Givenchy is a French fashion house, the dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller, who is from the United Kingdom. Queen Elizabeth, her sister, Princess Margaret, Princess Diana, and Kate Middleton all had their royal wedding dresses created by a British designer.   Meghan's long-sleeve dress had a boat neck and fitted waist instead of a dramatic ballgown skirt – but her long train, and even longer veil, still brought the drama.  Kate Middleton's gown had an A-line silhouette with a long train, but short veil, unlike Meghan's.   Also, while Kate opted for romantic lace sleeves and a V neckline for her big day, Meghan's dress had a boat neck and it seems the only sight of lace appeared at the end of her veil.  And here's both of them at their respective weddings to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  YOU'RE BOTH GORGEOUS, FLAWLESS DUCHESSES AND EXCUSE ME WHILE I SOB.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Wearing a hat to every event from now on, thank you. The royal wedding was full of top-notch looks from head to toe. Here, 23 of the best fascinators, hatinators, and hats from Harry and Meghan's wedding ceremony.  The Duchess kept it simple and chic in a cream hatinator with a flower detail.  Priyanka's lavender hatinator is almost as stunning as she is.  Victoria looks so posh in this netted fascinator look.  Did you notice the embellishments on the veil of Amal's hatinator? The mother-to-be's fascinator perfectly matches the cherry blossom motif on her dress.  Meghan's mother wore a beautiful mint hat with a bow detail on the back. Camilla went all out with the pink feathers on her hatinator. Serena's pastel pink fascinator is absolutely gorgeous. Kate Middleton's mom's fascinator featured a few floral details. Harry's ex-girlfriend arrived with this chic feather-like design. This floral fascinator perfectly matches Charlotte's dress. Joss Stone's fascinator was topped with whimsical feathers.  Karen Spencer opted for a beautiful purple fascinator. Kitty's abstract fascinator is a super-chic choice. This pink fascinator is simple and still makes a statement. Leave it Oprah to wear the most lavish and outstanding hat of all the guests.  Princess Eugenie went with a classic pillbox hat for this royal wedding. The Queen brought it with this little lime green number.  Sarah's veiled fascinator is so stunning. This fascinator is all about the dramatic netted veil. This cream fascinator is super-chic. Zara's navy fascinator has a hidden flower right in the middle.  This green on green combo is the perfect pairing.

			 This dress slaps.  My Amazon shopping cart is a chaotic jumble of household essentials (aka toilet paper in bulk), novels from my endless reading list, and gimmicky products I’ve convinced myself I can’t live without (currently, a posture corrector). The always-reliable retail giant is also my cyber mecca for anything required in a pinch, which recently turned out to be a polka-dot dress so freaking perfect, I want you to get one too.   Did I really need something new to add to a closet that’s already burstin'? Absolutely not. But the same could be said for the two pairs of shoes currently en route to my apartment…  Anyway, the reason I even bought this dotted frock is because I was in a pre-BBQ bind early this summer and needed something that could take a ketchup spill without landing me at the dry cleaners the next day. This baby far exceeded my expectations. Here's how: You can fold, roll, even stuff this little number into your suitcase all hodge-podge-like and I guarantee its ruffled hems will not lose their oomph. The wrinkle-resistant material has earned this getup a permanent place at the top of my packing list. Plus, it's super lightweight and won’t take up precious real estate in my carry-on. Very important.  This polka dot dress has over 200 reviews and comes in six colors. Tap the link in our bio to see them all. 📷@jessicapavlik_ A post shared by  Amazon Fashion (@amazonfashion) on Apr 26, 2019 at 2:38pm PDT If you haven’t already clicked *buy now* let me remind you that polka dots are always a good idea, especially when they cost a fraction of your monthly cell phone bill. It has that effortless, “Oh this? I just threw it on!” appeal that put French brands like Rouje and Sézane all over our fashion radars and social feeds, but without the price tag. So if you end up loving this frilly bb as much as I do, go ahead and treat yourself to a second one in any of its available statement-making shades (I’ve got my eyes on royal blue).  Don’t just take my word for it! Over 500 other Amazon shoppers reviewed this dress and gave it an average of four out of five stars. One woman even wore it to her wedding rehearsal dinner and had this to say: “I originally bought the teal green one but had to go back to order the blue and red one too… I can’t wait to wear the red one for Christmas activities with my family!”  Good friends understand your @amazonfashion obsession, best friends #founditonamazon with you. 👯 Link in bio to get this look, and be sure to share your best bestie moments with us using #founditonamazon for your chance to be featured! Photo: @thetrendygalblog with @ohwhatasighttosee A post shared by  Amazon Fashion (@amazonfashion) on Jul 28, 2019 at 1:14pm PDT The delicate print of this piece is understated, so you can attempt a carefully executed pattern clash à la Olivia Palermo or simply layer the dress under a chunky knit sweater to transition it into fall. And if you want to feel like a total style star, the rich green hue will complement the glow of your favorite gold accessories for an outfit that truly ~shines.~  Get. It. If you’re looking for something comfy but cute, this loose-fitting silhouette is a no brainer. Its dainty details—the slightly raised collar, the flared quarter-length sleeves — make it a compliment magnet with enough coverage to wear from spring through fall.

			 And, yes, they’ll keep ya warm.   Spring and summer may be popular seasons for weddings, but don’t underestimate the magical—and romantic!— vibes of winter. There are a bunch of wedding-guest dresses out there, from sequined midis to velvet wraps, that’ll look straight-up amazing for a cold-weather soirée. Also, if the nuptials take place close to the holidays, that’s one more reason to break out a fun, festive frock. Whether it’s a black-tie occasion or more of an informal situation, these 22 winter wedding-guest dresses will take you from the ceremony to the reception dance floor with ease. The halter neckline on this one shows off your shoulders and back, while the split hem makes it stand out from the rest. Pair it with black sandals or embellished pumps for an extra dazzling flair.  A darker burgundy shade is perfect for a winter wedding; plus, the off-the-shoulder neckline is great for emphasizing any statement jewelry.  Sometimes a simple knee-length lace dress is just the thing you need. It’s classic, you can wear it more than once, and you can always dress it up more with fancy earrings, a chic hairstyle, and clutch.  Solid colors aren’t for you? Get in on a printed dress that features multiple colors. You can match your accessories with any of the other hues in the pattern for a fully coordinated look.  Have you ever seen a prettier shade of emerald green? The velvet stretch fabric on this wrap catches the light, while the shorter hem won’t constrict you on the dance floor. A win-win.  You’re not obligated to wear a dress (unless the invitation specifically calls for it, I guess?). So a chic black jumpsuit with split legs is a unique way to dress up for a wedding, while still looking stylish.  Hemlines like these are perfect if you want a more dramatic look—and if you wanna show off your amazing heels. This cobalt blue shade is stunning and you can easily throw on a sophisticated coat over it if the weather is chilly.  Channel a disco ball with a sequin dress that lights up with each movement; plus, this style has a lower back that you’ll def want to show off.  The cut of a V-neck midi looks so elevated, and the billowy sleeves will give your arms and shoulders some room to breathe.  A timeless LBD with a twist, thanks to the ruched bodice and see-through sleeves—you’ll def wear this outfit again.  It’s like wearing an off-the-shoulder dress without worrying about the sleeves falling down! Genius. Complete the outfit with a pair of killer platform heels.  A textured knit dress with three-quarter length sleeves is a great option on a chilly day. With long pendant earrings and metallic high-heels, you’ll get so many compliments.  Metallics are neutrals too! You can accessorize this gorge midi with so many other colors, and the tulle detailing at the hem adds a delicate touch.  An embroidered floral dress is undoubtedly fancy and subtly sexy thanks to its slightly sheer material.  A style that has long sleeves and covers most of your legs is welcome, especially for an outdoor wedding. No shivering here!  You can’t go wrong with a luxe velvet column with a thigh-high slit. Finish it off with a pair of metallic pumps.   Go all out with a golden spaghetti strap number. With a chic clutch and strappy heels, all eyes will be on you. (Second only to the bride!) A tiered gown with an extra low neckline strikes the perfect balance of sexy and sophisticated. Just make sure to use fashion tape to avoid any mishaps!  Polka dots are classic, so opt for the playful print with this asymmetrical style if the wedding dress code is semi-formal or cocktail attire.  A dark floral midi with a ruffled waist and hem is flirty and elegant; plus, the straps are adjustable so you don’t have to keep yanking them up.  A black dress is no-fuss but always looks polished. If you want to spice it up a lil, opt for sequins and eyelet sleeves to make a statement.  Puff-sleeves are happening, folks! They add extra oomph to a red sequin mini without overwhelming the silhouette.

			 Designer Michael Cinco spills on the decadent creation. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has returned to slay, queen, slay on the Cannes red carpet. After transforming into a real-life Cinderella at last year's festival, the Bollywood superstar reprised her stellar black tie wardrobe with another couture gown by designer Michael Cinco. "The gown was created to reflect the impalpable dream of a butterfly metamorphosis," Cinco tells BAZAAR.com of the exquisite creation.  The result has us simply stunned:   The Dubai-based designer did not skimp on the details for this dress: it's completely covered in Swarovski crystals and French palettes; it consists of ultra-violet, midnight blue, and red thread works; and it boasts a 20-foot train that mimics "a butterfly emerging from it’s chrysalis." Plus, its body-hugging silhouette and sweetheart neckline compliment Bachchan's figure perfectly. The elaborate number took 3,000 hours to make, Cinco reveals. (That converts to 125 days if the dress-makers worked non-stop.)  [asset removed due to syndication rights][asset removed due to syndication rights] Cinco initially created the crystal-covered gown for a Swarovski exhibition, but the actress helped make the look her own.  "We worked closely with Aishwarya and her team in creating the perfect fit and making minor alterations to best suit her," the designer adds. [asset removed due to syndication rights][asset removed due to syndication rights][asset removed due to syndication rights] This is Rai Bachchan's second year in a row wearing a Cinco original. She made just as stunning of an entrance last summer a frosty blue ball gown by the designer. The Disney princess comparisons were inevitable. After teaming up two years in a row for the international red carpet event, Raich Bachchan and Cinco prove to be a designer-and-muse power duo.  "Aishwarya’s style is truly empowering," he gushes. "She uses fashion to instill confidence and reflect a sense of empowerment that is not only beautiful, but also very inspiring. Her timeless style radiates such an allure, as she’s so well versed in her every curve, knowing exactly how to dress to accentuate her defining assets." We can't wait to see what look the pair debuts on next.

			 Chloe Flower will smash whatever you think you know about classical music and look fire doing it. Inside Chloe Flower’s sleek downtown Manhattan apartment, it’s physically impossible not to stare at the 9-feet-long mirrored Baldwin piano standing in the center of the living room. (The same 9-feet-long mirrored Baldwin piano once owned by Liberace.) You see a million tiny images of your face reflected in the instrument, and if that’s not enough bling, bedazzled speakers sit atop it for extra sparkle. For Chloe, a classically trained pianist, music is central—literally and figuratively—to her life. That, and being flashy as hell. You don’t need an appreciation of classical music to recognize Chloe.  You know her as the scene-stealing wingwoman to Cardi B’s viral performance of “Money” at the Grammys in February—and if you didn’t catch it, it’s worth a watch. The composer and pianist nearly upstaged the award-winning rapper with her lightning-fast finger movements, intoxicating frenzy for the beat, and a dramatic black-and-white Fouad Sarkis couture gown. 
 Take a quick scroll of Chloe’s Instagram feed, and you’ll notice that such capital-F Fashion moments aren’t just for the Grammys stage. Her everyday style is eye-catching and dramatic—think vintage luxe brands, like Versace and Jean-Paul Gaultier for Dior, mixed with up-and-coming designers, like L.A.-based Michael Lungu. Chloe’s style choices represent how she’s feeling and the vibe of her songs. They also smash the stodgy, buttoned-up stereotypes long associated with classical music. The 33-year-old even considers her outrageous piano one of her accessories, which tracks nicely with a theory of hers: “Music and fashion are married.”  “I think that’s why people think classical music is not accessible,” Chloe tells me at her home on a recent Friday morning. “When you think of a classical pianist, you imagine a man wearing a tux or black suit, and you see a woman wearing a stiff ball gown.” Meanwhile, pop musicians routinely slip into Swarovski crystal–lined bodysuits that make them impossible to ignore. “You see Beyoncé or Rita Ora or any of these amazing artists who are wearing feathers everywhere. It’s like—why shouldn’t classical music do that too?” For the record, Chloe is wearing head-to-toe John Paul Ataker—a top with voluminous sheer sleeves and pants with a see-through leg. If Chloe’s whole fashionable aura seems like second nature, that’s because it is. Her mother imbued her with a sense of style practically since birth: “My mom would leave often to take me shopping in Italy or Paris just for fun,” she says. “I would watch her buy all the designer clothes back then and I’ve never known anything other than high fashion.” (Side note: Your mom seems fab-u-lous, Chloe.) Although she learned a lot about designers and shopping from her mom, their aesthetics couldn’t be more different. “She doesn’t like my style at all,” Chloe says, laughing. “My mother likes sleek, timeless brands like Armani and Calvin Klein and Max Mara. I like poofy sleeves and crystals everywhere—look at my piano!...If you couldn’t tell, I’m a maximalist.” That OTT fashion sense ranges everywhere from luxe finds to fast-fashion retailers like H&M and Zara. Her top current-season sites are Net-a-Porter, SSENSE, and Matches Fashion; eBay, The RealReal, and 1stdibs are her vintage reseller go-tos.  And then there’s Instagram. “I find new and young fashion designers there—because they’re new, they’re excited to have me borrow a piece or make something for a video,” she says. “I was up-and-coming for literally 100 years, so I feel like I should be supportive of other up-and-coming artists.” 
  But if Chloe’s not wearing a couture gown, she’s in sweats, albeit designer ones (Y-Project hoodies are a current favorite). There’s no in-between. “I don’t own a pair of jeans and a T-shirt,” she says—a fact, having peeked inside her closet later that day, I can attest to. “These clothes are so fun for performance and for when I go out, but they’re sometimes uncomfortable,” she adds. “I like to be comfortable, and I work from home. I’m not going to put heels on just to go to Whole Foods. That said, I’ll always pair my casual outfits with an amazing purse, or amazing sneakers and coats and earrings.” Especially because you never know who might pop by the studio. “I still want to look cute, just in case,” she says. “One time I looked crazy while recording, and then camera crews came in unexpectedly and shot behind-the-scenes with Toni Braxton. Another time, Beyoncé showed up to the studio.”  Lest you think she’s all about appearance, her whole raison d’être boils down to one idea, and it’s not just about making classical music badass—or even high fashion.  “Having a different approach and a different look draws people in,” she says. “My ultimate goal is to capture a younger audience and have kids demand more music education in public schools.” Since the Cardi B performance, she’s received hundreds, maybe thousands, of messages from parents telling her their children have never been more into classical music, alongside videos of their kids playing piano. “High schoolers have been asking me for the Cardi score, trying to learn how to play my remix,” she says. “This stuff is what makes me truly happy.”   Photographer: Ruben Chamorro; Fashion Editor: Rachel Torgerson; Stylist: Rebecca Alaniz; Creative Director: Abby Silverman; Senior Visuals Editor + Producer: Raydene Salinas Hansen; Supervising Video Producer: Abbey Adkison; Cinematographer: Jennifer Cox; Sound Recorder: Ash Knowlton; Video Production Assistant: Scott Kidwell; Makeup Artist: Clarissa Luna at Crosby Carter Management using Becca Cosmetics; Makeup Artist Assistant: Kinshasa; Hairstylist: Patrick Kyle; Manicurist: Kayo Higuchi.

			 Being hands-free has never been so stylish. You might as well lug around your books, laptop, wallet, and whatever else you need in a backpack that's as cool as you are. Here, 5 styles that you'll want to carry all your things in. If you prefer a chic foldover flap with drawstrings then this brown leather one is calling your name. It has a cell phone holder, and three other interior storage pockets so you can fit all your necessities in with ease. The wide, adjustable back straps ensure that the weight is evenly distributed and that it doesn't dig into your shoulders, while the classic brown shade will go with almost every outfit in your closet.  If a canvas backpack is your go-to, but you also want to differentiate yours from all the rest, opt for an unexpected berry-hued one that'll stand out. It has striped lining that'll hold up to any wear and tear and can fit a 15-inch laptop without looking too bulky. The exterior pocket also provides extra room for storage. So basically, this is one backpack that you'll want to wear for the function, but love because of the color.  If you're more subdued, try out a gray backpack with an angular outside pocket and double zippers. The buckle straps make it easy to adjust to whatever length you prefer, while it's also the perfect size to tote around. You'll look so stylish with the minimal design that all your friends will ask where you got it it from.  If you're constantly lugging a TON of stuff around, you'll need a bag that can fit everything and one that truly holds up over time. Odds are you've seen Fjallraven backpacks everywhere, but with good reason. This bag can hold a 17-inch laptop, and also has padded straps, two side pockets, an outside pocket, and it's water-resistant. Seriously, this bag can withstand carrying all the things you need for the long haul.  A mini bag is perfect if you have one too many things to fit in your usual purse; plus, there's the added bonus of being hands-free. It's great for commuting or if you need to take an extra outfit with you since it features one main compartment, two side pockets, and outside zippered storage.

			 Because who wants clothes that are only good for nine months?  Congrats, you’ve got a beautiful bundle of joy inside you! But it’s not an easy feat navigating the endless options of maternity outfits and figuring out what will fit. Yes, there are comfy maternity leggings, but you might not want to wear them your entire pregnancy. With your growing bump, you want clothes you can wear to work or go out in that still reflect your personal style, but finding the right maternity clothes can seem like a daunting task. Trust me, I've been there!  Personally, buying items I could wear after pregnancy was a top priority because I'd get the most wear out of my purchases. And even "non-maternity" options can accommodate a bump if it has enough stretch or has a roomy silhouette—ordering a couple sizes up can work, too! Here, we've rounded up 28 cute maternity (and non-maternity) brands and stores to shop from that'll make you the most stylish mama-to-be.  This brand has tons of pretty options like these cropped overalls that are perfect for fall and winter. It also offers comfy sleep sets, sweaters, and undergarments that'll make you comfortable during pregnancy.  You can find pants, loungewear, and jersey dresses—all at a reasonable price point—with this label found at Nordstrom. This two-piece set comes with a leopard-print duster and tank midi so you can wear them together or separately.  For your basics, Motherhood Maternity is a great resource. From nursing bras and tops to sleepwear and T-shirts, there is a full range of styles that come in extended sizing as well. If you need to stock up, this is the place to do it.   Founded in 2001, the maternity brand started with a simple smoothing belly band worn over jeans and later expanded into ready to wear, like this wrap dress with a flutter sleeve.  While Anthro doesn't offer maternity-specific designs, it has styles that can still fit pregnant bellies, like this stretchy ribbed sweater dress and other flowy dresses and peplum tops. It also has items in extended sizing so you can find more options.  Not looking to drop a ton of cash? ASOS' maternity clothes are trendy and affordable. It also has a range of styles from a low-key smocked dress (pictured here) to fancy off-the-shoulder velvet midis fit for a party.  Lululemon may not be the first brand you think of when it comes to maternity clothes, but surprisingly there are a lot to styles to choose from. With the use of lycra in most of their pieces, something like this effortless jumpsuit is super comfy because it stretches while keeping its shape. It also has a wrap silhouette so you can tie it looser as your bump grows.  Pressed on time and want a one-stop shop?  A Pea In The Pod is your answer.  It carries everything from functional clothes, like maternity bras, to designer brands. This corduroy and striped combo is a great everyday look, TBH.   Yes, the retailer's site has tons of maternity clothes that don't cost a lot. Plus, you can read all the enthusiastic reviews from shoppers to get a better sense of the fit. The "Amazon Coat" from Orolay is actually a great cold-weather jacket for a mom-to-be because it has an expandable zipper on the side that gives your bump more room to breathe.  Created by two women who believe that women of all sizes should have access to a stylish wardrobe, Universal Standard is a great go-to for your work and weekend outfits. It offers sizes from 00 to 40, and also includes a maternity line for future moms, which includes this utilitarian jumpsuit.  Jessica Simpson's maternity line has items in extended sizing—like this cozy-looking knit sweater!—and you can find bottoms, jeans, tops, and even gorge coats that will accommodate your bump, no matter what trimester you're in.  Look cool and stay on a budget with Zara's maternity collection. It's a mix of items that are specifically for your growing body and items from the regular collection, which are still roomy in certain areas. For those who still want to wear their purchases post-baby, Zara is definitely a good bet.   The cult favorite among soon-to-be moms, Hatch paved the way for fashionable maternity clothing.  Although it's a bit pricier than other brands, it makes great investment pieces because you can wear the clothes whether you're pregnant—or not.  If you have more of a boho style, Pink Blush is basically the Free People of maternity wear. From trendy off-the-shoulder tops to flowy lace maxi dresses, it carries a large range of easy-going silhouettes, like this balloon-sleeve knit dress.  J. Crew has a collab with Hatch on its site, but you can also wear its same modern preppy styles while pregnant if you opt for something with stretch or order a couple sizes up. You'll find fun patterns that will be a reprieve from the sea of black clothing that maternity brands usually offer.   Madewell offers maternity-specific pieces that will support your belly, like its waistband denim, but what's great is that its regular styles also work for during and after pregnancy—e.g., this wrap belted cardigan.  These silhouettes are perfect for pregnancy because you can adjust it to the shape of your body as your bump grows.  At H&M, you get trendy styles at more inexpensive prices like this pearl embellished sweater.  There's no doubt that whatever you decide to buy here, you'll get ALL the compliments.  While it offers covetable designer brands, the retailer also offers a curated selection maternity clothes, like the skinnies seen here from 1822 Denim.  A pair of fitted stretch waistband jeans are a lifesaver for the the very end of the pregnancy—the band holds up your belly and streamlines your entire look.   Tried and true, Gap makes everyday maternity clothes that you'll never want to take off—e.g., this made-for-winter mockneck sweater. It even has side buttons that make nursing easier after you give birth.  Pretty and classic styles are Seraphine's aesthetic for maternity wear. It even includes a solid selection of evening wear which can be SO difficult to find. (Kate and Pippa Middleton have worn the label during their pregnancies, FYI.)  Another plus? You can shop for baby clothes and gear all on the same site. Sporty and comfy, Athleta has a lot of unrestrictive and stretchy designs (like this roomy pullover here) that'll fit over your bump whether you're going to a workout class or you just want a stylish athleisure look.  This Amazon label has a bunch of functional items you can wear during and after your pregnancy—including cocktail dresses, classic tees, leggings, camis, and more—all available at a steal.  Loft maternity is an extension of its core collection with easy, flowy silhouettes for those who aren't fans of form-fitting bodycons. It was designs you'll want to live in, but also ones you can wear to wear to work, like these black pants with a thick belly panel.  Maternity clothes conjure up mental images of frumpy outfits, but it doesn't have to be that way! These high-waisted leather pants are a prime example that looking sleek and elegant while pregnant is definitely possible. In addition to these shiny leggings, this label has maxi skirts, sweaters, puffer coats, and more.  For all the die-hard Shopbop fans, great news! They have a pretty solid maternity section with pieces that are equally covetable as their main collections. I mean, this off-the-shoulder cocktail dress would wow at any holiday affair.  Trying to find office-appropriate maternity outfits?  Isabella Oliver has modern work clothes available in an array of colors ranging from neutrals to seasonal hues. You'll look absolutely timeless on the outside (even if you're feelin' that morning sickness on the inside).  For all things baby-related, the Tot is the website for you.  While it carries cute dresses and sweaters for your outdoor ventures, the Tot specializes in chic and comfortable options like leggings and jeans.  You can find a plethora of casual designs that are easily transitioned from pregnancy to postpartum from this Australian brand  Most designs are made of cotton so the fabric is breathable, soft, and not irritating.

A neutral shoe is a summer staple, but one with studs adds an interesting element of style to your look. This silver-coated cropped sweater makes any look instantly more cool. These sweats are comfy as hell — slip them on before heading to brunch. The tie-dye pattern of this slip dress makes it stand out, but you'll love its backless detail even more. You can wear these rust-colored wedges every day this summer. This neutral tank comes with a sexy back detail that ties with a bow. If you're living for the wide-leg denim trend that's happening now, you'll want to add these to your cart ASAP. It's so easy to justify a pretty LBD — but this high-low hemmed piece also has a steamy cut-out back detail, which makes it sooo different from all your other black dresses. Black, white, red, and navy go with pretty much everything, and this sporty piece is about to be your new casual go-to top. If you're the kind of person who hates big wallets, this stylish card case is the best find — it holds all your essentials without taking up so much room. How cute is this one-piece suit, with its suspender-like details and sizzling stomach cutout? A dark-wash denim jacket goes with basically everything from dresses to sweats. This sweet, stackable gold ring is the kind of subtly sparkly thing you can wear all the time and never take off. May I introduce you to the comfiest, coziest weekend wear you'll ever buy? The summery flats you'll want to wear literally every day. The sexy center split on this knee-length skirt makes it extra flirty. Everyone needs a cute pair of white denim for the summer, and these have a ribbed, moto detail that makes them both polished and edgy.

			 Posing on a scooter in Italy, no less.  Kourtney Kardashian was looking more than a little blue on Thursday – not necessarily because she was sad, but because she was literally dressed in the color from head to toe.  She was in Capri, Italy, posing on a bright-yellow scooter wearing a teeny baby blue bandeau with matching high-waisted pants. And – don't forget to swipe! – in the second photo, she's standing in a magical-looking garden underneath a canopy of lemon trees. She completed her moody blue outfit with white-hot sandals and a coordinating quilted Chanel bag.  Thanks to Kourtney, now all I can think about is the Eiffel 65 song that was *the* anthem of '98 – you know the one. 
  Blue outfit aside, it seems like Kourtney's packing strategy for her romantic Italian vacation with boyfriend Younes Bendjima over the last couple of weeks was just bringing tons of bra tops and pants. I mean, she also wore a similar outfit when they were in Rome together.  She did bring some other options with her, though, because she also posted another photo on Thursday, in which she wore a mini, white off-the-shoulder dress with cat-eye sunglasses. In the snap, she was on a boat off the coast of Capri, which is now where I need my next getaway to be.    Keep up the #travelcontent, Kourt, so I can live this glam vacation vicariously through you.

			 Um, I kinda want flip-flops now?!  Summer isn’t technically over (it ends September 23, FYI), but what better way to ignore the fact that it’s soon coming to a close than to daydream over these lust-worthy  spring/summer 2020 shoe trends? From candy-colored knee-high boots to pair with any of your flowy spring dresses to chunky flatforms that promise height and comfort, there’s a variety of options ranging from trendy to functional. (Better yet? Pair ’em with these bag styles and you’ve got a whole fashion look next season.) Here, 10 shoe trends that’ll make you go, “Is it next spring yet?” Colorful boots are here to stay.  Knee-high length is the fashionable  height of the moment, but you can opt to go shorter too.  Ganni Sies Marjan Marc Jacobs  Flip-flops were big this past summer, but these hot-weather classics are anything but touristy.  Rejina Pyo Sies Marjan Kiko Kostadinov Who doesn’t love a schoolgirl reference?  Wear them at the office or at brunch. They’re polished and fun at the same time—especially with tights and socks.  Marc Jacobs Carolina Herrera  Fashion East  The ’90s style goes with virtually anything, from jeans to dresses. Try a pair in a fun pistachio shade! 3.1 Phillip Lim Marc Jacobs Rejina Pyo The Birkenstock-esque sandal isn’t going away come spring if the runways had anything to say about it.  3.1 Phillip Lim  Zimmermann Lala Berlin FINALLY, a break from the pointy toe. The square toe lets your little toes breathe and feel less squished together.  Proenza Schouler  Preen by Thornton Bregazzi Ganni Who doesn’t love a comfy sandal? These ones also give you the added bonus of extra height, if you’re into that.   Simone Rocha Matty Bovan Erdem Go all out with straps to your knee or go a bit more low-key with them just at your ankle.  Chalayan Temperley London Longchamp Is it a shoe or a sock?  Not completely sure, but it looks oh-so-comfy (and who among us misses lacing up sneakers?)! Longchamp Zimmermann Jamie Wei Huang Yes, florals come around almost every spring and summer, but it still feels weird not to include? Opt for neons or more subtle pinks with this trend.

			 Anna O'Brien, founder of curvy fashion blog Glitter and Lazers, wasn't prepared for the comments she received during a public photo shoot. standing in the middle of Times Square, it wasn't super hot, but the pressure of what I was about to do was making me sweat. My fingers slipped against the fabric of my maxi skirt as I fumbled with the tightly-knotted bow. My outfit fell away, revealing my pink bikini beneath it. I heard hollers from strangers, but their words blurred into an indecipherable mess as I tried, unsuccessfully, to remain calm. A sliver of sun peeked out from behind the skyscrapers, reminding me we were about to lose the light. No more time for nerves — it was now or never. "Let's do this," I said out loud. My clothes dropped all the way to the ground, and the voices around me became clear. “I want to suck on them tasty toes.”  “Hey baby, let me butter them biscuits for you.” I looked up to see three men with camera phones filming me. Our eyes met, and one uttered, “Twerk for the camera baby, show them how that ass clap.”   Tears began to well up. I was prepared to be pointed at, shamed, and called fat. I didn't expect to be fetishized.  When RTL, a German news channel, reached out to me to film a documentary-style shoot about life after a Las Vegas photo shoot that went viral, I was the one who suggested Times Square. I could have picked a park, a hotel, a pool — literally anywhere else in the city. I chose this. Before, I'd shot in hotels or on beach boardwalks, but I'd never snapped photos with so much attention on me.   The world only really sees plus imagery that is perfected and somewhat vanilla — usually that of smaller, perfectly proportioned curvy women. It didn’t need another stock image of an hourglass figure, in an indiscernible space, wearing a one-piece. I wanted to make a statement and I wanted to be seen — I'm more than my body and I deserve respect and human decency.   Fifty feet to my right in the busy, tourist-filled space were two thin, large-busted women, wearing only g-strings and some body paint. I watched them with envy. Nobody yelled at them as they worked to hustle up a few dollars selling photos with eager tourists. They were just another part of New York. My mind jolted back to my reality as a man reached forward to hand me his mixed CD. As I pushed it away, he tried to grab hold of my wrist to talk to me.  I yanked my hand back. “Hard pass,” I screamed with the toughest face I could muster. “No thank you. Please leave me alone.”  He stepped back into the crowd that was slowly forming, and his friend then began to call out to me. “I’m just showing love for a BBW, baby. I want you to know that men want you. We love them big booty queens like you. Show off for your fans, baby.” My tears turned to anger, and the words began to fly out of my mouth: “It doesn’t make it OK. You’re disgusting. Please stop. Please just stop…” The man justified his response by saying that plus women "don't know they're f*ckable." Let me be very clear here, as I stated in the caption for the photo I later posted to Instagram: A plus-size woman's worth, or any one woman's worth for that matter, is not contingent on someone wanting to have sex with them. You don't exist to pleasure someone else ... you exist to change the world. My rant was interrupted as another man carrying a "Give me cash for weed" sign passed between us. He looked at me, grimaced, and shouted out an uninspired fat joke, grinning proudly. Little did he know he'd just done me a favor by silencing the other men and causing a distraction. A crowd fully formed after that, and the men who had made the lewd comments remained relatively silent. The film crew told me I should only do what I felt comfortable doing, and that we could stop if I wanted to. A few minutes passed, and I was able to reset myself and push away my experience with the lewd commenters. Now I was safely in model mode. Pose. Click. Pose. Click. Magic.  Still, as I turned around for some side-angle shots, I noticed one of the men had continued to film me from behind. In nearly every image I have, you can see him standing there, holding his camera-phone up at the perfect height to capture my backside. I was faceless to him. I was just a body he wanted to exploit and use. My feelings didn’t matter. A plus-size woman's worth, or any one woman's worth for that matter, is not contingent on someone wanting to have sex with them. I felt humiliated and questioned why I was even enduring all of this. I considered stepping down and ending the shoot early — it only had been about 15 minutes — but just when I was about to give up, my eye caught sight of a little girl in a red tank top and denim overalls watching me.  I waved at her, and she returned my gesture with the biggest grin. “You’re pretty,” she whispered. I realized in that moment, it had all been worth it. I had been seen.

			 You probably misinterpreted her Instagram from yesterday.  Selena Gomez's Met Gala look (in particular, her extra-orange tan) was met with harsh criticism on Monday night. Like, people on Twitter were so fired up they not-so-subtly told her to fire her entire glam squad.  Then, she seemingly owned up to the judgement by posting this video on Instagram yesterday, which people interpreted as her running away from her poor beauty choices. The comments on the 'gram, btw, have been turned off.  And it seem like it was her way of being like "Okay, yes, my look was not so great, here's a joke about it." Apparently, the joke was actually supposed to be interpreted as her running away from her **haters, not the look itself, a source told People.  “In person, she honestly felt great but not everything looks the same as it does in person,” the source said. “She was just clapping back at people who were commenting on her tan and hair and wanted to make a joke about it.” 
  Not only did people critique her "glow," but they jumped on her hair and dress, too. Selena apparently "loved" her custom Coach 1941 gown, though.  “She had two outfits to choose from and decided on Sunday which one she was going to go with,” the source said. “She loved the dress and was very involved with it.” To capture the theme of the event, which was "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination," Coach embossed Selena's bag with her favorite Bible verse, which is a really cool personal touch, but not quiteee enough to save this look.

			 OMG. Kim Kardashian was "packing" on Tuesday night and, per the video she shared on Instagram Stories, that means sitting on the ground in a bikini, and taking pics.   Guys, this video stresses me out, because it feels like she has so much more to do, and it's unclear how much time she has to accomplish it. I hope there's a suitcase somewhere out of frame that's totally organized and full of the clothes she's bringing, because otherwise, in this clip, it looks like she's gotten nothing done.  There's a ton of clothing hanging up on racks behind her, as well as shoe options on the ground, and an educated guess tells me she's trying on this bikini to see if she likes how it looks enough to bring it along. There's so much more to do!! Speaking of the bikini, it's an olive green color, with a square neckline and '90s-era high-cut string bottoms. She looks very good in it, so the getting-distracted-from-the-task-at-hand seflie thing totally makes sense, but seriously, now, get a move on! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 She totally stole the show! Chrissy Metz is spending her time between seasons of This Is Us ruling the red carpet. The actress hit the stage at Sunday night’s Billboard Music Awards in a black dress that blew everyone away. Metz attended the show to present the award for Top Social Artist, alongside her This Is Us costar, Justin Hartley. And they were met with thunderous cheers from the crowd.    .@JustinHartley and @ChrissyMetz present the #BBMAs for Top Social Artist presented by @23andMe! 🏆 pic.twitter.com/LaA9wLuZ3b She traveled to the awards in Las Vegas in high style, flying in a private jet alongside Hartley, Tyra Banks, Rebel Wilson, and Derek Hough.    We had the best PJ to Vegas this morning! @derekhough @justinhartley @ChrissyMetz @tyrabanks and our awesome team. Ready for Billboard Awards tonight on NBC x pic.twitter.com/f8L9kUEyqx She and Hartley were seated near Ariana Grande, who used to be one of Metz's clients back when she worked as a talent agent:     Metz wore a black, one-shoulder dress custom-made by designer John Paul Ataker, and people could not get enough of the gorgeous look.     LOVE @ChrissyMetz LOOK!! Yasss girl yessss!!!  #BBMAs Chrissy Metz looks so bomb 😍 #BBMAs  She’s long been a style icon for people looking for plus-size fashion, and quietly previewed a new collection from LOFT before it hit shelves. And she has said being in the spotlight has inspired her to take more risks.  “The red carpet transformed how I dressed,” she told People. “I never wore form-fitting dresses before. There are a lot of people who make you feel uncomfortable if you show a chubby stomach, arm or leg. I was being educated, while becoming part of the conversation on size inclusivity.”

			 Groovy, baby. “Everything that’s old is new again” is a common refrain, but it’s true. From chokers to wide-leg pants, it’s like back to the future in my Amazon shopping cart. High-fashion designers in particular are making a major case for a return to the ’70s, which was a wild decade full of disco and revolutions. In the following gallery, see all the retro trends that are coming back into style and find out where you can shop the pieces for yourself.  Bell-bottoms are back, you guys! Rejoice! Take this knit pair from Alberta Ferretti’s spring ’19 collection, which came down the runway during Milan Fashion Week. I dig.  SHOP SIMILAR Here, Gigi Hadid combines the “on Wednesdays, we wear pink” motto with my personal catchphrase, “bell-bottoms for life,” into one lewk.  Bell-bottoms are pretty comfy by definition, but you know what could make ’em even comfier? If they’re made out of stretchy knit material. What goes nicely with a pair of flared bottoms? A top with bell sleeves, my dear. The updated version of this style is a silky button-down blouse, like this one from Carolina Herrera’s spring ’19 show, which we saw during New York Fashion Week. SHOP SIMILAR Cara Delevingne’s sister, Poppy, opted to rock multiple ’70s looks here. Bell sleeves! Flowers! Patchwork! I stan. Bell sleeves don’t always have to be dramatic, as evidenced by this understated top from JM Collection. If you thought bra tops were born thanks to Instagram, boy, are you wrong. They were beyond huge in the ’70s. This neon-green version from Emilia Wickstead’s spring ’19 show at London Fashion Week is a modern take on the retro look. SHOP SIMILAR Kim Kardashian, as you probably already know, is at the top of our underwear-as-outerwear-enthusiast list. “The bigger risk of wardrobe malfunction, the bigger reward,” I imagine Kim whispering to herself every night before bed.  How cute is this bralette? It comes in multiple colors, and at that price tag, you can pretty much collect ’em all. I’m willing to bet that clogs will never go away. They’re just too comfortable! And versatile! Peep the pair Gigi Hadid wore down the runway at the Max Mara Milan Fashion Week spring ’19 show, for example. SHOP SIMILAR Kate Bosworth is clearly very happy to be wearing clogs, probably ’cause her feet are so dang comfortable.  These cute red sandals feel clog-inspired rather than all-out “I borrowed my mom’s clogs, lol.” Crochet is ev-er-y-where these days, from NYFW (see here at the Michael Kors spring ’19 show) to the racks at all your fave stores.  SHOP SIMILAR Zendaya was recently spotted rocking a splash of crochet while on the press junket for her new Spiderman film. I wonder if her crochet is meant to be, um, a little spiderweb-y? Crochet is, well, kinda see-through, so you’re gonna have to get creative with your undergarments. But it’s totally worth it. Look how cute! Everyone had a jean dress during the ’70s, and let’s be real, pretty much everyone has one now too. Here’s a denim dress out in the wild, aka at Coach 1941’s spring ’19 NYFW runway. SHOP SIMILAR Opt for a ripped denim dress if you’re going for something a little grungier, à la Lucy Hale.    Or go for something a little more office-friendly that would look great with a CROCHET sweater (see what I did there?). Long-sleeve dresses—especially with plunging necklines—were pretty much the ’70s uniform. This spring ’19 Mara Hoffman look fits the bill nicely, especially with its bell sleeves. SHOP SIMILAR Khloé Kardashian is serving ’70s-meets-Greek-goddess realness right here, and I’m into it.  I love me a breeze-catching dress. Not to sound like a broken record, but just Think! How! Comfy! When the women of the ’70s weren’t wearing clogs, they were most likely lacing up their gladiator sandals. Longchamp’s spring ’19 show featured models like Kaia Gerber rocking the style with aplomb at New York Fashion Week. SHOP SIMILAR Nowadays, you  can find gladiator sandals that lace all the way up to your kneecap, as modeled by Kenny and her leggy legs.  The beauty of these sandals is that they don’t require you to physically lace them up yourself. They come pre-laced! Ain’t modernism grand? You couldn’t go anywhere during the height of disco fever without seeing a halter top. Today, designers like Jaquemus, who featured this piece at the brand’s spring ’19 show during Paris Fashion Week, are highlighting the design element with low-cut minidresses. SHOP SIMILAR Eva Longoria pushed the halter top into an even more modern place with her asymmetrical sleeve.  I’d like to live in this halter top all summer long, thank you very much. In the ’70s, the height of glamour was a slinky satin gown worn with a feather boa. Laquan Smith showed this sexy li’l piece during his spring ’19 NYFW show, and I have a feeling it would fit riiight in at Studio 54.  SHOP SIMILAR I’m in love with Lili Reinhart’s baby-pink slip dress. Other dresses need not apply.  I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it.

			 The Fug Girls break down who rocked the red carpet and who missed the mark. Winnie nabbed a gig as a fashion correspondent for MTV, but we're confused as to why that requires a costume change while she's on the very red carpet she's supposed to be covering. It would be one thing if she couldn't decide between two slammin' ensembles, but she simply goes from one boring sheer dress to another, even sheerer one.  No, we're not talking about accepting Pete Davidson's proposal, although she certainly seems warm for his bleach-blond form. Rather, we're referring to Ariana scuttling her signature high ponytail for this party in favor of a shiny, sleek, and altogether more adult 'do. If Pete Davidson's BDE is responsible for Ariana shaking it up, well, long may your magical coupling reign. This feels like one of those OMG Look At What They’re Trying to Sell Us Now! memes that pops up occasionally on Facebook. World, do not let hip-less pants become a thing. PLEASE, O Gods of Nordstrom, say no to cheek cutouts.  Tiffany’s head looks great, but we were happier to see that she changed out of this sheath basically immediately after presenting the first award. Honestly, if you had run odds on what Amber would wear to ANY given event, this wouldn't even have been considered a long shot. What does she do on actual Halloween? Wear clothes from The Gap?   If you told us that 75 percent of this also came in a plastic bag on a hanger at Halloween Depot, we’d be tempted to believe you, had Steven Tyler and Joe Perry not been so wildly consistent over the years.  On a night that is, essentially, a sheer and strange circus, Sofia turns up in a gown that makes her look like the undisputed Queen of the Big Top. In a good way.   So many people went with the apparently never-dying transparency trend that it's impossible to pick one that we like the least. But while many of the other sheer efforts had consistent and identifiable patterns, this one just looks like stormy weather rolling in from the coast.  Batten down the hatches.   This is all-around delightful. The rich raspberry velvet, the gazillions of dollars worth of emeralds, the kicky pixie cut...Cardi looks both lively and elegant, a combination last seen at the VMAs...uh, never.   Blake wore FIVE OTHER SUITS this past week alone, and these are the very definition of a big finish. If she starts to run, she may well actually take flight.   We feel weird: Kylie Jenner looks....chic, and adult, and coolly competent. We’re both thrilled to be alive to witness this historic moment, and also feel unmoored by how extremely surreal it is. Here’s hoping this turns into enough of a trend that we get used to it.   This might almost be too restrained for the VMAs, but the tie-dye effect and the high-low hem save her from seeming too straitlaced: It’s fanciful and fun. J.Lo got the Video Vanguard honor, which is the VMA equivalent of a lifetime achievement award—even though it frequently goes to people who are only partway through theirs. One might think she'd answer that call by going Maximum J.Lo, in something artfully designed to free the abs that she has sharpened to such precision that you could use them to slice cheese. But instead, J.Lo picks a slinky, sleek silver gown that flaunts her incredible assets just as well and just as confidently, if not more so. Shine on, you flawless diamond.

			 Everyone’s favorite layering piece is back, y’all. I’m guessing, when you hear the words “denim jacket” you automatically think of the classic, boxy kind with pockets on the chest. But, just so you’re aware: You’ve got a lot of other options!! There are so many *other* styles of jean jackets out there—from puffy coats to trench coats, moto styles and more—and they all look great. So, please, allow me to take you on a denim-jacket journey that could change your life(!)...or at least your outerwear game. Keep a-scrollin’ for all the jean-jacket outfit inspo you’ll ever need.  Ooo, you edgy. Obviously that means you need to pair the leather pants that already live in your closet with this fun jean jacket and white booties. As autumn rolls into winter, you’ll want a transitional style that also keeps you hella warm, and that’s where this cutie rolls in, looking all great with a graphic tee and some rust-colored cropped wide-leg pants. Pair this fun, ultra-warm puffer with olive cargo pants, a creamy sweater, and a nice neutral backpack. Turn heads in a longer jean overcoat, worn with pants in a matching wash and nude sandals. If you love to live in the now, then you’ll definitely want to get this jacket with voluminous sleeves and a peplum detail. It goes nicely with black jeans and leopard booties, don’t you think? Matching set, but make it stand out—like, a lot! Go for this tie-dye-effect two-piece if you’re looking to set yourself apart from the crowd. You can wear it together to really turn heads, or wear each piece separately for something more subtle. Keep it low-key with this black denim cropped jacket that has a toasty teddy-fleece hood and balloon sleeves. Pair with black pants and a black crop top for a fun ~all black~ style. You either love the bike shorts trend or you hate it, but either way you can’t deny the style looks great with a cropped denim jacket and white crop top, right? Nothing wrong with the most timeless style of denim jacket. Pair it with a fair isle sweater, white jeans, and a hat! A shacket = a shirt/jacket hybrid, and it’s great for those fall days that are chilly, but not quite chilly enough for the real deal denim jacket. This one can be worn tucked in or out, and looks great when paired with darker pants. The classic jean jacket, but with a fun, bandana twist! Since this already has a lot going on, wear with a striped button-down and white pants that don’t distract from the topper’s cool vibes. You’ll get so much use out of a half jacket/half dress. Wear it closed for a cute knee-length style; wear it open as a duster option! Then pair with black sock booties. You’ll love topping this lace shirt and leather skirt combo with a super-warm acid-wash style, promise! If you love that oversize look, but don’t love being swallowed up in the extra length, consider a cropped but boxy jacket like this one, which goes nicely with jeans in the same wash and a cute white tank.

			 Inspired by Meghan and Harry, Cosmo decided to muse on a flipped-script fable. We begin with Princess Harrie, dressed in her summer best, who meets an every-guy named Mark.  Once upon a time, there was a princess named Her Royal Highness Harriet Victoria Louise Alexandria. (Don’t worry, you can just call her Harrie.)  She and her family ruled a small kingdom in Europe, but she was living in the U.S., working toward her PhD in early childhood development. One fateful day, Harrie went to see a new garden being planted at an inner-city elementary school. She took pictures with the kids, and they brought her around to meet the volunteers.  Everyone was lovely — until they came upon a super-hot (but super-frosty) man in work books and jeans. He was Mark, a landscaper helping out at his former school.  Harrie went  to shake his hand, but he just nodded. He didn’t even put down the planters he was holding. Whatever, fine-but-grumpy dude, she thought. Not thinking about your pecs...at all!  Mark was flummoxed that anyone would turn up to a dirty work site in a dress...no matter how well it skimmed her curves. He had taken the day off in order to help out, not to pose for an Instagram moment with a princess.  Still, there was no denying that she was gorgeous. But Harrie wasn’t a photo-op-only princess. She soon pulled on gloves and planted her (royal) ass off, starting with her favorite: peonies. When she threw dirt on the landscaper by mistake, she quickly apologized.  Despite himself, Mark was charmed. He sent her peonies the next day—with his number. Peonies! Like the very ones she’d been planting. Harrie was delighted by Mark’s bouquet (and his decidedly un-grumpy note).  How soon could she text him? And were emoji part of the palace protocol? Screw protocol, she decided. He was cute, and she hadn’t been on a date in ages.  Moments after she messaged her thank-you, he asked if he could take her out. “Could it be on the DL?” she responded.  Two days later, they were sipping champagne and enjoying brunch in Mark’s own garden.    From then on, they were inseparable—but in secret. (Dealing with the press was beyond annoying.)  Keeping it under wraps was kind of hot, so Mark didn’t mind—until the night of the garden gala. He wanted to feel like a prince by her side, but he was more like a random plus-one.  After watching admirers swarm Harrie while he was summarily ignored, he was like, “I’m outta here.”    But he couldn’t stay away. He had totally fallen for her.  When paparazzi caught Harrie crying the next day, Mark dropped everything, picked up a bunch of “I’m an idiot” peonies, and ran to her place to try to make things right.  “Flowers aren’t enough this time,” she said. “I know. I love you. Let me show you how much,” Mark pleaded. And, oh, did he ever. And so it was that they soon went public, via a carefully executed press plan. His world still exploded, but the moments they spent in private were pure bliss.  Which is why, after plotting an elaborate proposal, Mark ended up popping the Q in bed one lazy morning instead. She said yes, then jumped on him. The morning of the big day, Harrie woke with a smile that never left her face—not during the procession to the church, not while walking down the aisle (with a bouquet of peonies, obvi), not while dancing with her new husband.  And she definitely was still smiling when they finally snuck off to bed.  Mark asked Harrie if he could plan the honeymoon as a surprise. (Okay, so her team did help a little.)  He told her to bring her bikini but leave the tiara at home.  When a friend’s jet ferried them to a private island, she knew this was just the beginning of her new happily-ever-after.

			 This hilarious look was the TRUE winner of last night.  When Tom Brady arrived at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to play in Sunday night's Super Bowl, his outfit caused quite a stir. That's because the New England Patriots quarterback came dressed in a double-breasted peacoat (with the collar popped, no less), a black turtleneck, shades, and bluetooth headphones to top it off. Twitter just about lost it with Brady's over-the-top look. Check out the best reactions below:   Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBeauty.

			 It's like she's a supermodel or something!  According to Kendall Jenner's Instagram Story, she celebrated America's 242nd birthday by attending her half-sister Khloé's Fourth of July bash, lighting sparklers, and lounging by the pool in a tiny white bikini from her own line, Kendall + Kylie.  
 She wore an oversized red-and-white striped button-down as a cover up and served up a major July Fourth mood relaxing poolside on a sofa. Outfit aside, her abs are really all I can see because she's striking a pose like it's her job (LOL she's a world-famous supermodel, so I guess it is).   The bikini bottoms featured a high-cut style that Kendall has been sporting seemingly 24/7 as of late. Recently, she posted another Instagram Story, in which she's wearing a similar-looking bikini and captioned it "BFF with this window."  And in late June, she wore another piece from her Kendall + Kylie line in a bright yellow hue.  
  Her friends also sported Kendall's swim line at the party, including a striped one-piece and a one-shoulder suit with a sexy cut-out.  Anyway, it looks like Ken had a great day filled with food, her best pals, an inflatable slide, and hot dog water, all in celebration of AMERICA.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 All the fashion hits and misses from MTV’s big night. The MTV Movie & TV Awards once again taped the show—and thus, rolled out the red carpet—two days before it airs (you can catch the telecast Monday night). Fair warning: This is one of those events where the attendees generally tend to be pretty big spoilers for who’s taking home the trophies. But that means you can play along while you watch and see how many of our best- and worst-dressed picks ended up taking home some hardware. We’ll give you a hint: Jada Pinkett Smith.  From the waist up, Storm looks like she’s just fallen out of a sweeping 19th-century epic love story on Masterpiece Theatre, while the rest of it is crisp and summery yet still romantic. It’s a successful—and unexpected—mash-up, and we want more. We sort of wish JPS had shown up to accept her Trailblazer award wearing JUST a blazer, because we love a pun. But we can’t be mad at her for hitting this mark so well: Her sparkly suit is totally festive and makes her look like a complete boss. We’d expect nothing less. Tessa is definitely someone who experiments gleefully on the red carpet on the regular (hanging out with Janelle Monáe may have inspired some of that recently, as they share a flair for the visually dramatic). But Tessa is also promoting the new Men in Black installment and therefore, it’s highly appropriate that she arrived dressed as a glamorous defense lawyer on her way to the galactic high court.  Listen, do we understand what’s happening here? We do not. We are flummoxed by this entire situation. But we do know one thing: When the world eventually burns, at least Nick is going to be expensively prepared. Even when it’s the end of the world, a man has to have his priorities straight.     We are surprisingly into this wide-leg disco jumpsuit on Melissa—maybe it’s the light chevron pattern; maybe it’s the vampy lipstick with the loose, wavy hair; maybe it’s the sunglasses. Most likely, it’s all of them together—a happy convergence of the right outfit and the right styling on the right person. Cheer up, Mischa! Okay, yes, The Hills is not quite The O.C., but it sprang from the loins of a show that was basically the reality TV version of The O.C. and that’s...not nothing! Pack away these widow’s weeds. Zach was MTV’s host for this event, and he definitely didn’t slink into the auditorium. We applaud a man who decides to go Full Miami to any event and we salute his commitment to the color teal. (Those are eight words we definitely didn’t think we’d be writing this weekend.)  She stars in a show about a teenage witch, so it makes sense that our reaction to seeing the erstwhile Sally Draper here is to wonder if she slipped us some kind of funky potion. This looks like someone shoved one of the Oompa Loompa scenes from the original Willy Wonka movie, where they sing as a bunch of trippy words fill up the screen, into a tote bag. That’s neither the flashback nor the earworm we were hoping for today.     This reminds us of a Project Runway offering where the designer, in a total panic, stopped doing one thing and started doing everything: There’s a big sleeve! A random bow hanging down all over her! A sweetheart neckline! Off-center and off-kilter ruching! A giant slit! Imagine if she’d kept the sleeve and then worked that retro vibe throughout.  Dude, did you miss the memo? Menswear is interesting now. Menswear is happening. Men, in menswear, are making an effort to live up to the bar that women have been setting for years. Get with the times—and get a friend who will stop you before you go to an awards show sporting any old T-shirt.  Visit the Fug Girls on their website or follow them on Twitter.

			 Shhh, don’t tell the others!  Not to stress you out or anything, but the gift-giving season is coming up quick, y’all. And that means you gotta get somethin’ for your dad, mom, sister, best friend, and your brother, of course. If you still don’t know what to get him, consider this your guide full of ideas (no matter what he likes). Because even if you’ve known your brother your whole life it can still be hard to figure out what the hell he wants! Here, 26 of the best gift ideas whether your bro is into tech gadgets, music, or, yes, beer, that will make your holiday shopping that much easier. Cross your brother off the list with any of these cool presents.  A watch with a brown leather strap and deep blue face will look mighty good on his wrist—and hopefully keep him on time.   A leather belt with brown on one side and black on the other will get double the wear and make any of his ensembles look a little more refined. A guy who can tell an IPA from a Pilsner or Porter from a Stout needs a proper glass to go with each. This crystal set gives him an excuse to host a get together.  Sometimes you just wanna stay indoors all day and do nothing, and these fleece joggers were made for exactly that, yet they also look nice enough to wear in public with some sneakers.  Is his idea of a fun time going hunting for old records? Give him a retro-looking suitcase record player that includes Bluetooth, so he can stream music too.  His neglected winter wardrobe needs a serious update, and a knit beanie in a classic blue will keep him warm and make his outfits look pulled together.  Does your brother constantly talk about his facial hair? Then he’ll love a fancy moisturizer. With cedarwood and eucalyptus oil, it also happens to smell amazing.  A minimalist who’s constantly cleaning out his wallet will really appreciate a slim cardholder that only carries the bare necessities.  Whether he’s going to a coffee shop, school, work, or traveling for the weekend, he’ll like a simple backpack that’s compact enough for easy transport, but also has multiple pockets for maximum storage.  A burgundy sweater is a great layering piece that will complement literally any cold-weather outfit.  Whether he likes the classics or more current films, a behind-the-scenes shot of the Casablanca star on a bike will make any room seem so much cooler.  A pair of tortoiseshell frames with polarized lenses will make your bro the most stylish guy in the room.  Cufflinks don’t need to be super expensive to look fancy. Take this set of knotted silk ones, for instance.  Are printed button downs his go-to? A blue and red checkered one (with super-soft fabric, I might add) will be a fab addition to his closet.  For a brother with a timeless aesthetic, a cashmere coat is practically an essential; plus, he’ll be so cozy once the temperatures start to drop.  Some vintage-looking Nike kicks will be his favorite pair to wear thanks to the iconic swoosh and light-colored sole.  If he’s trendy, odds are that plain black socks are too boring for him, so get a wool set in some colorful hues that he’ll love to show off. His arches will be supported, too, with this comfy style.  His signature drink is whiskey on the rocks, which means a classy decanter is definitely in order. It will look much better than a liquor bottle on his bar cart. And, even if whiskey isn’t his drink, he can put literally any other spirit in there too.  Does he collect hats like a sneakerhead hoards shoes? Then he’ll probably appreciate a soft burgundy cap in a cool, textured material.  A speaker and assistant in one, a Google Home Mini is the perfect size for literally any room. It plays music, can connect with his fave streaming service, and he can also ask it basically any question.  A wool tie with a plaid pattern might be just the gift for him if he’s always wearing jeans and a simple T-shirt, but doesn’t have anything for a dressier occasion.  He’ll be fielding compliments left and right with a woodsy scent that has notes of amber and bergamot.  A simple silver chain with a black pendant is a necklace he’ll love to wear with all his T-shirts and crewnecks sweaters.  Chinos and a simple T-shirt can be completely transformed with stylish footwear, like these suede Chelsea boots right here.  Whether he’s serious about pursuing music or just enjoys playing as a hobby, opt for an acoustic-electric guitar that comes with a tuner and has amazing sound-quality.  Does he spend hours holed up in his room playing endless amounts of video games? He’ll probably stay in there even longer  once he has the Nintendo Switch—but he'll totally thank you for it.

			 *Buys five new swimsuits.*  Moda Operandi is having an end of summer designer sale with items up to 80 percent off—you'll want to hit it up ASAP.  Below, 17 of the best discounted picks that will have you vacation ready this season.  The ribbed material of this pale blue top and the matching bottoms will be so comfortable, whether you're swimming in a pool or lounging on the beach.  If you have a lot of high-waisted pants, but don't know what to wear with them, consider the simple bra top. A one-shouldered top with a twist detail is so chic.  A striped crop top that you can wear with a skirt or pants is versatile, while the ruffle makes it flirty.  If you can't get enough of chokers, opt for a bandana-style with graduated crystals.  Ever wear a pair of jeans that make you think, "Wow, my butt looks really good in these?" A high-waisted pair will do just that. Plus, the flared silhouette will stand out from all your skinnies.   Your next vacation needs this tiny tote bag because of its bright pom poms that scream "summer." Also, if all you carry is your phone, keys, and wallet, rest assured they can all fit in the straw compartment.  Get yourself ready for picnic season with a blue gingham crop top that has an elasticized band for an easy slip-on.  A bright red, retro swimsuit is sure to stand out on the beach, but what is even more eye-catching is a style you can wear as a one-piece or a bikini with the help of its convertible straps.  A pair of cotton striped pants is an essential for a seaside getaway—or just a day of running errands—because they're effortless *and* stylish.   A crop top with a bustier-styled bodice is the perfect combination of dressy and low-key. Pair it with patterned pants and heels for a night out, or with a pair of denim cutoffs for lunch with the girls.  Odds are you've seen these trendy earrings before—even stars like Selena Gomez and Jennifer Lopez are fans of Rebecca de Ravenel's spherical designs—so snag yourself a classic black pair that are so Instagram-worthy.  You can never buy too much swimwear during summer, and a sale is the perfect excuse to add a cute polka-dot set straight to your cart.  If you're looking for an excuse to wear less blue denim, invest in a black skirt to switch up your usual color scheme.  Your feet will look so good with a pair of bow slides on the end of them, and the satin material elevates the casual style.  Want a suit that's the perfect balance of sexy and sporty? Look no further than these color-blocked bottoms and matching top that you can wear playing beach volleyball or getting your tan on—using SPF, of course! Get relief from the sun with a fashionable straw hat featuring stripes and fringe. Shading your face never looked so chic, TBH.  It doesn't hurt to invest in a unique statement piece, like a pair of  bright blue wide-leg crop jeans, because they'll stand out from the rest of your wardrobe and you'll get so many compliments.

			 “These are lined with what can only be described as shag carpet.” Attention, ladies everywhere: We have found the one pair of bionic sweatpants that will be your period pants, your WFH pants, your Netflix pants, and your dog-walking pants all rolled into one.  And for $36, these Yeokou fuzzy joggers are something you need to order, like, yesterday. The interior lining is thermal Sherpa, so pretty much the coziest thing ever, and even the exterior fabric is a super-soft cotton. These are not exactly meant to be exercise pants, unless that exercise involves heading to the fridge and back during a Queer Eye bingeing marathon (note: there are two pockets for stashing snacks after the fridge raid), but they sure are a great post-workout, post-shower cloud-like pant to throw on.  Allegedly, they motivate people to actually leave their homes in the winter. According to one reviewer, “Getting cold had recently become a wimp-out tactic for me, so I got these ridiculously thick sweats to get my butt out the door each day.”  She went on to compare them to a super-soft rug from the 1970s, which is an accurate comparison. “These are lined with what can only be described as shag carpet. Like the ’70s but softer. I tried several pairs across brands and these were the best I found. They’re so thick, they were basically wind resistant,” she adds.  Another fan who purchased them for a chilly camping trip called them a “winter survival essential” even for people who aren’t camping. Lots of reviewers also mention sizing up for extra comfort and room, which is a no-brainer anyway when it comes to sweats.  One reviewer painted the picture perfectly: “Just imagine curling up on the sofa with hot chocolate and a friendly cat during a polar vortex in your fleece-lined pants.” She gets the life—you just need to add a pair to your cart and you’ll also be on your couch in them in two days.

			 Also, she has wings?! Kendall Jenner wore the mini-est of mini dresses to Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty on Sunday night — and for what it lacked in length, it definitely made up for with its dramatic sleeves. The tiny black LBD from Redemption was an extremely leggy look for Jenner, who accessorized with simple black ankle-strap pumps and stunning green statement earrings.     The supermodel also wore another black dress to the Golden Globes in January, which was a half-mini half-ballgown number by Giambattista Valli.  Whereas most of the volume on that dress was in the skirt, her Oscars afterparty dress had all the voluminous detail on her shoulders. And on top of its extremely large, ruffled sleeves, her super short dress also featured mesh insets down each side, giving a sneak peak at Jenner's matching black lace underpinnings. And from this pose, she was really feeling her look. Honestly, SAME — who doesn't love an amazing sleeve moment?

			 Look hawt for your big night. Listen, as the bride, you can wear pretty much whatever you want to your own bachelorette, but many opt either for a black or white dress. Scroll on for the cutest ones for any type of soiree, from Vegas sh*tshow to Hamptons garden party. Check out Cosmo's official bachelorette guide for more mind-blowing tips, tricks, and ideas. A polka-dot slip style is casual enough to feel right at home in a relaxing spa environment but dressy enough to work for dinner, too. If island life is what you're after, consider beating the heat in a lightweight, breezy embroidered number. A black bodycon midi is classy but still shows off your form—a perfect fit for this Southern city. You'll want something low-key but still dressed-up enough to be worthy of the scenery while sipping wine flights in the vineyards. A plunging, button-down midi is the perfect fit. With your favorite cocktail in hand, a form-fitting cape dress, and some red lips, you'll look like a snack, girl. What's more Vegas than a silky slip dress with rhinestone straps? Pair it with feather-trimmed shoes, and you've got yourself a good night ahead of you. A a frilled, lace dress with sheer paneling on the skirt will keep you both covered and cool during your classy AF garden festivities. Head from food truck to food truck in a sweet little button-down with a sexy, strappy back detail dress that's both low-key and cute, just like the city.  When dancing, you want to feel smoking hot—but figuratively, not literally. That's exactly where a dress with a cutout back detail comes in very, very handy. If hitting the beach is in your bachelorette future, consider a sweet, frilled coverup as your dress of choice.  The rainbow detail at the bust of this dress screams sexy-casual, which is oh-so L.A. Pair the look with Tevas, and you'll be the comfiest bachelorette ever. If you're going to have your last night of singledom in Europe, first, can I be friends with you? And second, please wear a timeless black wrap dress—it's a particularly good look for stylish cities like Paris and Rome.  Sizzle your way through the clubs in Miami with a plunging white blazer dress that shows just enough skin. Embroidery! Tassels! A dress like this white maxi has everything you need for a fashionable bash. A black tank dress seems simple, but this one has a statement-making asymmetrical hem. Plus, it pairs well with flat espadrilles, meaning you can go from brunch to exploring the city without worrying about uncomfy heels.  Off to the Cape? Don't forget to bring a patterned culotte jumpsuit. Lace-up detailing down the front makes it extra sweet. A maxi like this one keeps you covered when it gets cooler at night—but it still shows some skin, thanks to its sky-high slit. If you're heading to Savannah, you'll want to keep cool, which is where a breezy wrap dress with a plunging neckline and high slit will come into play. If your bachelorette consists of more than your closest, most immediate friends and family, this one is delicate and frilly—yet subtly sexy as well. A striped, wide-leg jumpsuit is perfect for NYC's cool-girl vibes. Dress it up with statement earrings and fun, geometric shoes. Nashville's vibes are laid-back, so consider a black A-line dress with a few frilly details that's not too OTT. If you want, pair it with black cowboy boots for some extra country flair. Nothing says "bride" like white lace, and a crochet-patterned one is never a miss for a bachelorette soiree.

			 Step up your footwear game this summer with these trendy styles.  Arguably the best part about summer is all the cute shoes – Slides! Espadrilles! Sandals! Mules!  But one less-awesome aspect is figuring out which ones to wear. Here, 18 trendy, summery pairs that could make your decision even harder. Sorry! Nothing quite says it's summer like canvas espadrilles, and a pair in bright yellow will make your shoes the focal point of any outfit.  Raffia is a straw-like material that makes everything look beachy, and a slide style makes them effortless to put on.  Travel back in time to the '70s this season and opt for leather slingback clogs that will give all your floral dresses a bohemian vibe.  Odds are you're going to hit up your local pool at least once this summer, so why not slip on some baby blue pool slides that are waterproof?  If you want a summer shoe that's a mix of trendy and classic, opt for a square-toed style ballet flat.   Summer is *the* season for white sneakers – I mean, it's hard NOT to spot them on any given sidewalk – so embrace the trend with a minimal, sporty pair that will go easily with any ensemble.  A subdued neutral slide will complement any outfit, while the woven leather adds texture.  If you're not usually a fan of thong or T-strap sandals, one with a toe-ring instead might be right up your alley.  There's nothing more essential in warm weather than the humble flip flop, but a patent leather pair that comes in multiple shades to match different skin tones will be your most prized possession.  Get yourself wedges that you can wear all day without the footache that usually accompanies stilettos.  If you're no-fuss when it comes to footwear, Birkenstocks are the shoe for you. The style is popular every year because they're comfortable as hell. Gladiator sandals with lace-up ties will look so good with all your denim cut-offs and dresses. You can keep them more bunched by your ankles or criss-cross them up your leg for a more dramatic effect.  Knots or bows on the straps of slides add a flirty element to an otherwise simple silhouette, while a striped pattern gives off a nautical vibe.  The open-style backs of mules will give your feet some much-needed air in hot months; plus, a bright yellow style will brighten up your day.  Smoking slippers give you the comfort of sneakers without looking like you're on your way to the gym, plus the leather material will really hold up over time.   Low, block-heeled shoes are comfortable enough for all the walking you'll do outside, and ones that have knotted and lace-up details are always stylish.  While scallop details are usually featured on necklines and hems of clothing, you can also take the style to your feet with a pair of metallic strappy heels.  Combine your two favorite styles – sneakers and espadrilles – with light blue shoes that are perfect for a seaside vacation or for running errands.

			 And I’m VERY picky about my swimwear.  Normally, when I try on swimwear and then look in the mirror, a frustrated “ughhh” sound comes out of my mouth before I change out of it as quickly as possible—but NOT this time. I had ordered this high-waisted Solid & Striped suit, and when I apprehensively glanced up to see my reflection, I instead said something like, “I can’t believe this fits perfectly and actually looks great on me....What is this sorcery?!” If it came in more colorways, I would seriously buy All. Of. Them. I had previously only associated high-waisted bikinis with Taylor Swift circa 2012 (aka The Red Tour era), but lately, they’ve been popping up more than ever on my Instagram feed and everyone just looks SO good in them (hi, Selena Gomez and Kendall Jenner!). I had never worn one before, but I had a beach vacation coming up, so I figured I’d try something different. And man, everyone just do yourselves a favor and get this bikini STAT. No wonder celebrities (yes, even T-Swift herself) are obsessed with the brand.   Was kindly informed that this was NOT Pablo Escobar’s island A post shared by  Lauren Adhav (@ladhav) on May 20, 2019 at 3:44pm PDT  The bottoms hit right at my belly button, and the ribbed fabric was so comfortable that I didn’t want to take it off.  I’m extremely particular about my swimwear (aren’t we all?) and it can seem next to impossible to find one that fits in all the right places while actually making me feel confident, but damn, did this do the job. Also, it hugged my body without feeling too tight and retained its stretch so the elastic didn’t bag out later.  Before trying it on, I worried that my A-cups wouldn’t fill out the top since it’s an underwire style, but it was surprisingly snug and didn’t gape. Throughout a whole day of boating and swimming, I never felt like I was at risk of flashing anyone, which is just about all you can ask for in a ’kini, TBH. But for anyone with larger-than-A-cup boobs, just know that it’s probs not the *most* supportive top out there, even with the underwire.  I loved that the bottoms were full-coverage. Like, it’s weirdly hard to find that silhouette whenever I’m shopping for swimsuits, and IDK why??! Don’t get me wrong—the high-cut and cheeky ones are fun but just not for me. (The brand has a range of other cuts and styles if you prefer to show more skin, though, FYI.) Plus, because of the thicker fabric and ribbed texture on this one, it feels way more durable than your typical suit. Yes, at $85 each for the top and bottoms, it’s pricey. But I can’t tell you how many cheaper swimsuits I’ve bought that are just sitting in the bottom of a drawer because I realized the elastic digs in or it’s not as flattering IRL as I thought it was in the dressing room. I’d rather spend more on a style I know I’ll take with me on every beach trip because it’s that dang amazing. Basically, if you’ve been on the fence about the whole high-waisted swimsuits thing, definitely give it a try because you’ll be shocked at how comfy they are—and how freaking cute you look in them.

			 How NYC stylist Rebecca Alaniz manages to get sh*t done without the extra baggage. I was at a client's apartment in London two years ago, packing up two huge suitcases and two large garment bags full of her wardrobe choices, plus my own tote, when it hit me: I already had hauled all this luggage on double-decker busses across the city for seven hours straight earlier that day — and I was about to do it all again. A wave of dread washed over me, and I started thinking. I'm a stylist, so suitcases full of clothing come with the territory, but my own purse had caused additional, unnecessary stress and took up important arm real estate. Why in the world was I lugging that around, too? The bag contained my flats, a map, my phone charger, a cardigan, a denim jacket, bottled water, and a snack. I looked inside it and thought, All this stuff is just extra. I can live without it. From then on, I haven't worn a purse, and I haven't looked back. Whenever I tell people this, their reaction is inevitably a look of shock and disbelief and an incredulous, "WHAT?!" Then comes the barrage of questions: "Don't you ever bring a change of clothes or shoes to work?" "Well, where do you put your cell phone or your wallet?" "What about your makeup bag? I couldn't go anywhere without mascara or concealer."  The short answer? I don't need most of those things. I'm a New York-based freelance fashion stylist and work from home. That means I'm not usually heading from an office to drinks on the town — I'm typically already in my apartment with everything I need to change things up to go out. Plus, I keep my look minimal and don't wear a lot of makeup, so the only beauty product I need to take with me is my Chapstick. I just don't have it in me to redo my makeup halfway through the day.  When I leave the house, I bring just three or four things with me: my secret weapon — my trifold key wallet — which has spots for my keys and all my cards, my Chapstick, and my phone. Sometimes, if I need to carry money for cash-only NYC restaurants or bars, I'll use a slim men's wallet and stash my keys separately. Each of these items goes in a different pocket of my jeans — the keys or key wallet and Chapstick in the front, and the men's wallet and phone in the back. Sometimes, I just carry my phone in my hand. And if I'm not wearing denim, I'll slip on a blazer or a different type of jacket that has pockets. They're essential, people! Yes, there are times when I have to take more than just these items. For instance, I may need to bring my phone charger with me if I have less than 20 percent battery left, or sometimes I take a lipstick with me if I'm going to an event and want to feel fancy. In these times of need, I'll mooch off a friend, asking to borrow a little purse real estate. I'm aware the habit of putting things in other people's handbags could get annoying for friends after a while. My buddies actually haven't complained so far — I'm a homebody, so usually they're just thrilled I'm actually coming out for the night! Still, I try to be smart about it, spreading my asks around or letting pals charge their phones with my charger if they keep it in their clutch.  I plan my outfits around not wearing a purse, which means — you guessed it — everything has to have pockets. If it's a work from home, running errands kind of day, I'm always in jeans or shorts, so that's never a problem.  Shop Dresses With Pockets And when I do wear a dress or trousers, which only happens on super-hot summer days or if I get invited to a formal event, best believe it's going to have the extra storage — I specifically look for that. If it doesn't, I make sure to add a jacket that does. Shop Lightweight Blazers With Pockets But just because I like the freedom of going sans handbag (just think, you never need to tell someone to watch it for you while you're at a bar or awkwardly squeeze a clutch under your arm for an entire night!) doesn't mean I don't think they're stylish. I own tons of vintage designer purses, and I do sometimes wear them, mostly when I'm attending various Fashion Weeks around the world and want to look extra put-together. This is simply what works for me. It may not be your thing, and that's fine, but when people hear about my bag-less life, a sense of envy passes over them, and even if they can't go completely tote-free, they try to downsize. My good friend used to carry five bags with her everywhere. I gave her some pointers about going minimal, and although she still totes around a purse, she carries half the amount of stuff she used to and says it's changed her life. Most of my buddies have taken a closer look at what they carry with them every day, and many times, they follow up with me to tell me how lugging less daily has helped them too. One thing I know for sure is my days of running around London with bags full of clothes for a client, plus my own tote full of unnecessary items, are over. I've gained too much to go back.

			 Let me upgrade ya. Finding the *perfect* jeans can feel next to impossible, but luckily, there are more options than ever, depending on the cut, fit, length, and wash you prefer. Here, 24 of the best in almost every style, shade, and rise that will (hopefully!) help you find your new favorite pair. There’s really no greater feeling than putting on denim that seems like it was made exactly for you!  This light-wash pair will become your go-to this season thanks to its vintage look and the fact that it doesn’t stretch (if that’s what you’re looking for). FYI: Topshop can run a bit small, so you’ll probs have to size up, but you’ll be so glad you did. Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, don’t have stretch if you prefer a stiffer material, can be dressed up or down, hit the leg just right Denim with slits in the leg openings gives you more ventilation in warmer months, and these are also edgy enough to wear on a night out. As one reviewer summed it up, they’re “comfortable with just the right high waist to keep everything smooth without being too restrictive.” Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, have stretch but are more relaxed in the calf area, don’t gape at the back Madewell can’t go wrong when it comes to jeans, and these demi-boot ones fit the bill if you’re looking for a subtle flare. Just a note to take a size or two down! Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, made with organic cotton, stretch doesn’t bag out Yes, these are a bit pricey, but according to the ratings, they’re well worth it. The color is a must for summer and the slight crop with distressing makes them low-key but stylish. Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, hug your body, not overly distressed, color goes with everything You can’t beat the price on these Levi’s considering the overwhelming amount of positive reviews they’ve received. (They have 453 5-star reviews, to be exact!) People love the soft material and the medium wash, which makes them great for everyday wear. Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, have over 600 reviews, available in 10 washes, you can choose from four different pant lengths Yes, the Duchess of Sussex herself (before she officially became a duchess though) has worn Mother’s The Looker jeans on multiple occasions. They’re a fan fave because they still look sophisticated but the raw hem keeps them trendy. (They can run a bit large and also have stretch, so consider grabbing one size down.) Why they’re great: have an almost perfect 5 stars, flattering cut, available in sizes 23 to 34 Black denim can be just as versatile as true blue, and this mid-rise pair from the Gap is super stretchy and comfortable against your skin. They’re also cropped just above the ankle for an ultra-sleek look. Why they’re great: rated 4.2 out of 5 stars, 110 5-star reviews out of 174 The Good Legs jeans from Good American are one of the brand’s top-rated pieces due to their diverse sizing and soft-stretch fabric. Plus, they don’t bag out after multiple wears. Why they’re great: 54 5-star reviews out of 64, available in sizes 00 to 24 and three different lengths, have ample stretch Looking for a retro high-rise flare? Consider these Ella Moss jeans. Just know that they can run a little long, according to the reviews. But whether you are taller, wear heels frequently, or don’t mind hemming them, these have that perfect flare—with a leg opening that’s not too small or large. Why they’re great: 15 5-star reviews out of 24, have stretch, fit true to size Lucky Brand’s denim is practically a must-have, and these guys are no exception. The stretch denim feels like leggings (without looking like them) and shapes exactly to your body. However, reviewers say they can run a bit large, so consider sizing down. Why they’re great: 4-star rating, have stretch, also come in plus petite sizing if you need a shorter hem Another best seller is DL1961’s Bridget mid-rise jean, which features amazingly soft fabric and hugs the body—although reviewers say you might want to take one size down. Why they’re great: rated 4 out of 5 stars, nice and stretchy If exaggerated flares aren’t for you, try a more tapered boot cut, like this pair from Joe’s. The stretch cotton provides a snug fit, and although the inseam may be better suited for taller people (5'6" and up), you can also wear them with heels, as seen here. Why they’re great: 56 5-star reviews, available in sizes 24 to 32 Reviewers are obsessed with the fit of these babies. Some did say the waistband can be a bit snug, but overall, the tapering doesn’t leave a gape and they have a comfy stretch. Why they’re great: perfect 5-star rating, no gaping in the back, have stretch If you don’t like super-tight jeans, try American Eagle’s high-waisted, wide-leg pair. They’re snug at the top but breezy throughout the legs and toward the ankles. Why they’re great: rated 4.2 out of 5 stars, available in three lengths, inexpensive These Rolla’s jeans always sell out thanks to their retro vibe. They’ll hit either right at your ankle or slightly above, depending on your height, but the medium-blue wash makes them versatile for any season—try them with sandals, wedges, or boots. Why they’re great: have a perfect 5-star rating, reasonable price, retro style If you REALLY want to commit to a dramatic wide leg, Brock Collection is totally for you. This pair features a subtle stretch, so they slide right on, and it’s cropped a bit more than usual if you prefer a shorter length. Plus, a neutral cream-colored jean goes with  literally everything. Why they’re great: comfortable at the waist, subtle stretch, don’t gape in the back If you’re in the market for a classic straight leg that lasts a long time between washes, get yourself Lucky Brand’s Emma high-rise stretch jeans and allow your life to be transformed. FYI: Don’t be fooled by the fake pockets in the front! Why they’re great: 50 positive reviews out of 69, form the waist nicely Jeans that elongate your figure? Say no more. NYDJ’s Marilyn pair seems to lengthen your silhouette, if that’s what you’re going for. If the super-soft material doesn’t have you hooked, the vivid blue wash totally will—just follow the brand’s recommendation to order a size down. Why they’re great: rated 4.4 out of 5 stars, available in sizes 00 to 28W as well as petite Everlane is known for its stellar basic denim pieces, and these straight-leg jeans are no exception. Order them in your true size for a more relaxed fit or a size down for a more snug feel. Why they’re great: rated 4.5 out of 5 stars, more than 1,500 positive reviews, available in five washes Old Navy’s Original Straight jeans are probably its most popular style (they have more than 3,300 reviews, hello). Reviewers love that these already feel broken in when you buy them, and they stay in place if you happen to move around a lot. Why they’re great: more than 2,000 5-star reviews, inexpensive, available in three washes and lengths If the high-waist life is the life for you, these straight-leg Lee jeans are worth a try. According to reviews, they have slight stretch but don’t sag after washing. Plus, the deep-blue wash makes them ideal for dressing up or down. Why they’re great: rated 4 out of 5 stars, more than 1,500 5-star reviews, inexpensive Next up: 5-star-rated jeans that won’t make your wallet cry! This Free People pair has a range of sizes, and reviewers couldn’t get over how well they fit throughout the waist and hips, although many suggested to buy a size down. Why they’re great: perfect 5-star rating, available in sizes 24 to 35 and three washes Looking for deep-blue denim that also contours to your shape? J Brand’s Maria jeans run true to size and have a slight stretch that hugs your frame. Why they’re great: 12 5-star reviews out of 14, subtle stretch, true to size If you love yourself a button fly, these Madewell jeans are calling your name. The slight distressing on the legs makes these a perfect casual jean that’ll become your go-to during summer. Reviewers say to size down as they can run large, but once you do that, they have an amazing fit. Why they’re great: have an almost perfect 5-star rating, come in both straight and plus sizes, have stretch, trendy distressed hem

			 It's the worst and you can't convince me it's not, so don't try. Hi. I do not like Halloween and I never have—ask me anything. Just kidding, don’t ask me anything, because I’m about to TELL you how much it sucks and you can just sit there and read it (or, you know, ignore me—up to you!). Here are all the reasons Halloween is The. Worst. I’m more of a salty snack person and I’ve never liked candy, even as a little kid, so I flat out don’t get the “treat” part of “Trick or Treat.” Why do we tell kids never to take candy from strangers and then confuse them by telling them it’s OK for one night of the year??? You are sending mixed messages.   ALSO, adults suck at buying the candy kids actually like. I’m partial to very few candies myself (SweetTarts, Sour Patch Kids = yum) and you can trust I hardly ever got any of them during my door-knocking efforts as a child. (What child wants Peppermint Patties?!) But even kids that DO enjoy candy never get tons of the kinds they like the best. We always ended up swapping stuff later on, or leaving a big pile of candy corn in the dust at the end of the night (if you honestly like candy corn, you’re beyond my help). Nothing feels good about shoving your hand into a pumpkin and taking out the guts. You cannot pay me to do this. This, of course, excludes costumes for babies and dogs because that’s cute as hell. All other costumes are sh*tty. They’re either cheap and break, or they cost an arm and a leg for two yards of fabric. I’m not crafty and that’s the end of that. As a kid, I told myself I could ride the tide of Halloween, because, obviously, it is childish and adults surely are beyond it, so it will die down, and I’ll be fine. I was wrong. Adults are crazy about Halloween—if anything, the standards for makeup and costumes have only gotten higher, and the pressure for an Instagram-worthy night-out is through the roof. All of this honestly takes the fun out of what should be a low-key, light-hearted evening with friends in which we all eat Sour Patch Kids until our mouths hurt.  Haunted houses, hayrides, corn-mazes, amusement parks—I hate ’em all. I do not like the heart-racing feeling you get when someone jumps out at you and I especially hate the idea that someone could actually grab me. WHO LIKES THIS FEELING?? WHY DO YOU LIKE IT?? I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND. Also—what if that chainsaw is actually real?!! I can’t deal with any of this anxiety, so, bye.  I hate other people’s Freddy masks, zombie makeup, and f*cking zipper faces. Cut that shit out! I also don’t like witches on doorsteps that cackle when you cross their sensors or big fuzzy spiders and fake webs that you people spread across the doors of your houses. I’m an innocent passer-by just trying to get from Point A to Point B and why are you attacking me!?!?  If you’ve made it this far through the article, I shouldn’t have to explain this one. No. That’s because I work at Cosmopolitan and you people love this dumb holiday so much that I’m forced to immerse myself in pages upon pages of “spooky costumes,” “creepy makeup,” “group Halloween costumes,” and “pun costumes” on Instagram. It’s my worst nightmare.  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram. (But don’t @ me if you like Halloween bc I seriously don’t care.)

			 Big shoulders are happening, folks!!!  Gonna go out on a limb and say you probably saw a voluminous-shouldered top or dress at least once this summer. They were everywhere! And if the Cecilie Bahnsen and Stine Goya runway shows—and the street style stars all over Copenhagen fashion week—are to be believed, this silhouette isn’t going anywhere. Severe, ’80s-inspired padded shoulders aren’t for you? The softer ~poof~ of a puff-sleeve top or dress might be the perfect way to keep this style in your wardrobe as the temps cool off.  The telltale signs of a puff sleeve: It usually features ruching at the shoulder seam which exaggerates the sleeves or it just has extra fabric with a fitted arm opening that adds major volume.  Either way, it’s dang cute. See? 
  Why is it so great for the colder times ahead? Because it looks even better in long-sleeve silhouettes and knit materials, especially in gorgeous, autumn-y shades like burgundy, olive green, and red. Also, even the short-sleeve designs easily transition to the next season if you wear them with the right layers. Your shoulders will love the extra breathing room and the airy, cloud-like feel of the silhouette. Shop all the pillowy goodness below, and everyone will say as (Napoleon Dynamite would), “I like your sleeves.”

			 Look cute even when you’re cold!  Sometime after Christmas and the New Year, the magic of the first snowfall wears off, and you’re left feeling cold, miserable, and (I’ll say it again) COLD. You turn into somewhat of a hermit in your apartment because you don’t want to face the weather, or, IDK, that might just be me. Either way, there’s a solution to all this, and that’s wearing super warm, but stylish, winter coats. You’ll be toasty enough to venture out into the snow with these babies, yet they’re also *fashun* enough that you’ll want to be seen in ’em.  Here, 20 cute winter coats you’ll want to bundle up in immediately.  Wrap yourself up in this belted coat that happens to look hella chic with a turtleneck. It’s fully lined so you’ll be all bundled up without wearing something bulky. Cinch it for a more formal look or wear it open to make it low-key.  Tones of brown, cream, and black go with any winter outfit, and will make ya feel oh-so-cozy even in the coldest of temps.  Give your plain ol’ coat added texture with a faux-shearling one that you won’t be able to stop touching. It’s roomy enough to wear over layers of sweaters and long-sleeves, but it also looks amazing with a simple top and denim.  Forget about your basic khaki trench when this croc-embossed one exists in the world! It comes with a removable belt for versatility, and ups the cool factor of any outfit. The waterproof material keeps snow, sleet, and rain out too.  Sometimes you just wanna go with something more traditional, like a double-breasted peacoat. This forest-green one has 2,000 reviews and a 4-star rating (insane, right?) so you know it’s good. You can also button it ALL the way up to keep your neck warm.  When the weather’s more extreme—i.e., there’s a freaking blizzard outside—you might want something more functional and protective. A long puffer (this one’s made from recycled water bottles!) will keep your legs covered and also trap in warmth with its insulation.  Faux-fur is a great material that feels super comfy but looks luxe. A wine-red longline style can be dressed up with heels and a midi skirt or down with jeans and a tee.  Remember, THE Amazon coat? Welp, it’s still available and people can’t get enough of it for a reason. Reviewers said it kept them warm yet felt lightweight, and the style has tons of pockets for your phone, wallet, keys, and copious amounts of chapstick.  A longline silhouette and faux-fur details at the sleeves looks v sophisticated. This winter coat is a must for fancier holiday occasions, and because of the neckline, it also shows off a hint of what you’re wearing underneath.  Don’t pay that age-old rule about wearing white after Labor Day any mind. A boucle winter coat that resembles the color of fresh snow looks so dreamy; plus, it also has a belt you can tie at the waist to feel more snug.   Love the retro vibe of a toggle coat? A brown, textured coat with these nifty fasteners is totally for you. The hidden side pockets are also lifesavers when your hands start to go numb.  A heavy-duty coat with a removable hood will come in handy when the temperature is literally freezing (or below). The cuffs at the sleeves prevent any cold air or snow from getting in, and the slightly oversize fit allows for layering underneath.  This hue can do no wrong. It looks good with any other colors—especially cream and dark denim. This wool-blend felt style is one of Madewell’s best-sellers thanks to its minimal design and soft fabric.  A long plaid coat is one you’ll wear for seasons to come because it’s such a classic style. Bundle up with a scarf over the neckline, and you’re ready to take on the (winter) day.  Don’t want to opt for a solid hue? Go all-out with a multicolored one with horizontal stripes of blue, green, red, and everything in between.   A suede coat with faux-shearling trim is basically a socially acceptable blanket you can wear in public. The easy-to-access front pockets are also pretty roomy for anything you need to store.  A short animal print coat is still neutral so you don’t have to worry about coordinating it perfectly with the rest of your ’fit. It has a subtle button closure, and looks just as good with dark denim as it would with a sweater dress.  You can choose to belt this coat or keep it open—we stan options! It has subtle side pockets and tiny slits on each side for an extra detail that differentiates it from the rest of your brown outerwear.  Indulge yourself with an insanely soft cashmere and wool blend coat that features three buttons and has a timeless look.  If you take cold weather seriously and really want to double up on protection from the elements, a down coat with an extra insert is just the thing that’ll get you through any snow storm.

			 Your fall wardrobe is about to be forever changed.

			 “The Kim who presents herself to the world has layers we don’t associate with her.” Although everyday outfit choices can reveal a lot about your values and self-image, Halloween costumes can be even more telling, according to fashion psychology instructor Dawnn Karen, founder of the Fashion Psychology Institute, which offers online courses on the topic. “Halloween is about becoming someone you wish you could embody more in everyday life,” she says. “Costumes show a quality that’s hidden below the surface—a version of who you are in the subconscious.”Apply these theories to some of Kim Kardashian’s most iconic costumes, and you’ll see a different side of her. “Her costumes show the depth and duality of her personality,” Karen says. “The Kim who presents herself to the world has layers we don’t associate with her.”  “I’m just as strong and powerful as any man.”Many people associate Kim Kardashian with beauty, not strength and intelligence, Karen explains. “Wonder Woman is not submissive or tender—she has all the qualities of Superman with feminine allure,” she says of the reality star’s costume. “She’s all about women’s empowerment.” Karen goes on to hedge this choice may reflect the reality star’s subconscious desire to be a role model for young women.  “I don’t care about rules.” In the context of the 1920's conservatism, flappers’ short skirts and bobs bucked the norms. Kim embodies that rebellion by emulating their look, Karen says.  “I trust no one.” To refresh your memory on Red Riding Hood: A little girl visits her grandmother, but once she arrives and does some sleuthing, she realizes a dangerous wolf is posing in the old lady’s place. “The theme is not trusting strangers,” Karen says. While it’s impossible to nail down exactly what inspired Kim to pick this costume, Karen thinks that subconsciously, the reality star might have been channelling feelings of betrayal in response to being misled.It’s also worth noting that the bulk of her outfit is red. “In color psychology,” Karen says, “red is used to draw in the opposite sex, and it represents sexuality, power, and aggression.” “I need some reassurance.” The Queen of Hearts, Karen says, stands for beauty, magnetism, and idealism, but some tarot card readers regard this character as an adored daughter and indispensable sister. “They’re always competing with each other and asking their mom who’s the favorite,” Karen says of the Kardashian sisters’ general nature, noting that Kim is the middle child. “She’s reaffirming her place in the family,” Karen says—a sign the star’s confidence may have been wavering. On the other side of the spectrum, this costume could be interpreted more literally: Many people consider the Kardashians to be America’s version of the royals, Karen points out, noting the star's crown and scepter. “She’s bringing that to light,” Karen says.  “You can’t touch me.” Symbolic of perseverance and physical strength, this leopard costume channels Kim’s inner feline, Karen says, adding that characteristically, the tight, form-fitting outfit has a sensual nature. “Negativity doesn't affect me.” Batman character Poison Ivy’s superpower is immunity—coincidence? Karen doesn’t think so. She sees the costume choice as a message that Kim is “immune to the bullshit,” i.e., all her haters.  “I run the world.” Catwoman, Karen says, is manipulative and cunning, while Kim’s interpretation—dressed head to toe in black leather—gives her a dominatrix vibe. “She’s empowered,” Karen says, referring to the color black, which represents power and intimidation in color psychology. “It’s like she’s trying to dominate her opponents and naysayers.”   “I have more depth than you think.”  Part-human, part-fish, mermaids have a double identity, Karen points out. Kim's costume represents this duality. “The person we see above the water—or in the media—is a different person than we see on [Keeping Up with the Kardashians], who is sensitive and vulnerable,” Karen says, hedging at the message this costume choice sends: “There’s a deeper side of her below the surface.” “I’m human, too.” Stripped down to the bare bones, without the makeup, hair, and clothing that make Kim recognizable, the reality star shows her vulnerability, Karen says. “Painting her face de-emphasizes her beauty,” she says, adding that this normalizes the star.  “It me!” In 2015, Kim posted this photo of herself in her 2013 Met Gala dress with a joke about pulling off her Kim K costume. And boy, did she nail it. “It shows she’s comfortable with herself,” Karen says of the cheeky move. “She was pregnant in the photo—when you bring life into the world, you rise above trying to prove yourself to everyone.” “I’m queen.” This costume really ticked off Selena’s biggest fans: They questioned Kim’s right to represent the late singer, who was widely regarded as queen of Tejano music before she died of a bullet wound at age 23. Karen says Kim’s costume choice was, in ways, self-aggrandizing, since she saw herself as fit to fill big shoes. But it could also be construed as paying homage to Selena—the answer lies in Kim’s subconscious.

			 Um...where have these been all my life??? A few months ago, I had a good ole fashion slumber party at a friend’s house, as one does. Movies, ’smores, hot toddies...the whole shebang. Oh, and pj’s/loungewear, of course. But while I was decked out in stained sweatpants from 2006 and a shabby old T-shirt, my friend was wearing the cutest AND comfiest lounge set I have ever seen in my life.  I knew I had to have the Richer Poorer Femme Boxers she was wearing and the matching Classic Bralette. After I recovered from our raging sleepover (okay, fine, we were in bed by 10 p.m., whatever,) I headed out to Nordstrom to try on the two-piece for myself. I didn’t know this at the time, but I was about to up my lazy-day game, big time. Why can’t you just wear underwear and a sports bra? What’s the difference? you may ask. Let me tell you: This is not just an ordinary pair of boxers and a soft bra. No. This? This is magic. Not convinced? Fine—scroll on to find out more.   What if, today, you decided to completely and unapologetically love yourself? What would you change? What would life look like? And most importantly, how would you feel? A post shared by  Isabel Calkins (@isabelcalkins) on Jul 23, 2019 at 6:33pm PDT  Made out of you-wanna-brush-it-with-your-face modal cotton, these two pieces were literally MADE to be worn all day long—and then all night long. They will truly make you feel like you are swaddled in a cloud.  Because of the way the cozy material hugs your curves (aka perfectly), you can wear these guys under anything and still feel comfortable. Nope, these boxers don’t bunch and yes, they’re still super sexy for a date night (not to mention the perfect solution for a surprise post-date sleepover).  If you are like me, lingerie and loungewear make doing laundry as hard as advanced physics. Usually, the directions are so specific and difficult that I either just don’t wash my delicates for who knows how long, or I wash it and mess it up completely. But these babies are shrink resistant (read: foolproof), you don’t need to worry about throwing it in with the rest of your load.  The absolute best part about both the Femme Boxers and the Classic Bralette is that each piece is under $30. Let me say this again in another way: It feels like you are getting a luxury piece of loungewear, but you are actually only spending half of what you'd spend with a different brand.  This bralette and pair of boxers is probably the most low-maintenance but high-quality item I have ever owned. When I wear them—whether dancing to Taylor Swift’s “Lover” around my house, or under a sundress, out in the open—I feel both flirty and comfortable. Starting to think maybe these items were just made specifically for me? Well, and for you, of course.

			 Aboah says she thinks it's "crazy" that anyone would consider Kardashian iconic. Earlier this week, Kim Kardashian was honored with the very first Influencer Award at the 2018 Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Awards. And some people were, well, not thrilled about it. Specifically, model Adwoa Aboah.  After Kim—in a very basic, naked dress—accepted her award, model Winnie Harlow posted an Instagram of herself and the honoree. In the very long Instagram caption, she wrote, "One of the realist and most down to earth people in any industry I’ve ever been around, I always Love being around you. Thank you for being you. If anyone understands not initially being accepted in an industry you adore like I do, it’s you!" Harlow then continued her caption by thanking Kim for "inspiring women" to be themselves.  And that's when Aboah, who recently covered British Vogue, took offense. "Is this a joke babe?...In what world has she inspired women to be themselves?" the fashion model commented on Harlow's post. "She is no icon nor an Influencer and I find it completely crazy that anyone would think she was." 
  Harlow later offered a measured response to Aboah's comment:  "We’ve all been up against all kinds in these industries,” she writes. “I may not agree with everything Anyone does but i show love where I feel its due…and a woman being herself against everything is admirable." For what it's worth, Kim also commented on Harlow's post, but didn't mention anything about Aboah's sentiments.  "This is the sweetest message!” she wrote. “I appreciate it so much! And you have helped me in more ways than you know ❤️. Love you!” In her acceptance speech Kim poked fun at winning the award. "I am kind of shocked that I am winning a fashion award when I am naked most of the time," she joked before adding that being on the cover of a fashion magazine was always her number one dream — and, just FYI, being a Cosmo cover girl specifically.

			 Truly a GENIUS idea.  As prom season sets in, many high schoolers are finding ways to make their outfits stand out from the rest — including Nazmayde Castillo. Her boyfriend MJ Johnson posted their prom photos on his Instagram in April, and her dress immediately went viral not only due to its vivid colors, but also because it's from popular retailer Fashion Nova.  While her gorgeous cobalt blue dress definitely made a statement in her prom photos, the long-sleeve mini cost only $50. Castillo transformed it, with the help of her aunt, into a full-length gown using blue flowers and glitter.  
  In an interview with Teen Vogue, Johnson said the skirt took two days to make because her aunt had to buy more flowers. Meanwhile, he matched her stunning look with a blue suit and a collared shirt underneath. The couple took pictures, which found their way onto popular Instagram accounts like @hallofprom and @theshaderoom. The creativity of her dress even won the support of Fashion Nova with this tweet:  LOVE how creative this couple was for prom 💙💙 pic.twitter.com/JRUKgZIVqA Honestly, what a STEAL. They both looked amazing, and I can only imagine how many compliments they got at prom. Also, no one wants to be caught wearing the same outfit to prom, so this was definitely a genius — and downright stunning — way to ensure your dress is truly unique. Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Be cool. Don't be all, like, uncool. 2019 is going to be interesting, if only because all the most popular fashion trends are eye-popping as hell. We're talking bike shorts, neons, red-and-pink outfits, patterned suits, and—wait for it—tie-dye. Scroll on to get a leg up on what all your fave celebs will be wearing next year. If you saved all your multi-colored, self-dyed shirts from middle school, NOW. IS. YOUR. MOMENT! Tie-dye is back in a major way for 2019, as demonstrated by Kaia Gerber on the R13 runway. You've seen 'em on the Hadids and the Kardashians and various influencers, but you're about to see them everywhere else too, if the runways are any indication. Here, a model at the Adeam show wears a sporty pink and red pair with a geometric cape.  Cold-shoulder styles are still going strong, but having a piece, like the one from the Monse runway show here, with just one cold shoulder is the fresh new way to dress in 2019.  This trend says, "Don't let a rainy day take away from your fabulous outfit—wear a coat that lets it shine through!" A model on the Kate Spade New York runway demonstrates the look in a bright pink style that still gives a peek at the yellow piece underneath.  Sure, you could mix and match patterns on your own, but this 2019 trend does the work for you. Here, a model illustrates how multiple prints work together in one dress during the Self-Portrait show. Get ready to see tons of this color in stores and online. Ashley Graham shows how to absolutely slay this hue while walking the Prabal Gurung show, here. Hope you like brights! You won't be able to get away from them come 2019. Here, a model walks down the Jeremy Scott runway in a mix of highlighter hues in orange, green, and yellow. The safari jacket style—a belted, lots-of-pockets kind of piece—has come into the new century in a variety of colors, sexier silhouettes, and even in jumpsuit form. Here, a model demonstrates a white version of the look, worn with wide-leg pants at the Zang Toi show.  Going head-to-toe in one spectrum of hues—like Adwoa Aboah did for the Marc Jacobs show here—is going to be a big deal in 2019. The western/cowboy style has arrived, people, and with it, it brings fringe. Colorful fringe, to be exact. Get a clear picture of the look with the help of this model, who walked in Anna Sui's recent runway show. Who doesn't love a dramatic cape moment? Bella Hadid shows off the look in a velvet magenta style for Prabal Gurung, here.  Get your needles out, fam! Crochet is back and you can wear it head-to-toe like this model at the Michael Kors fashion show. Designers were certainly enamored of this color combo on the runways—take a look at this fun style from a Christian Siriano show. Not to be confused with bike shorts, the baggier Bermuda style is known for ending just above the knee. This model shows off a bright pink pair on the Sally LaPointe runway, here. This black-and-white square pattern, popular during the '80s, is having a serious comeback in 2019. Just take a look at this cute off-shoulder style from the Oscar de la Renta show.  Feathers were all over the runways, creating very eye-popping pieces that you'll be sure to see everywhere in 2019. Here, a model demonstrates a denim and feather moment for the Calvin Luo show. Remember that time in, like, 2010, when everyone was wearing see-through crochet flares? This is like that but everything on the bottom is sheer including (but not limited to!) all types of pants, all types of shorts, and all types of skirts. During the Laquan Smith runway show, a model gave us a preview of what sheer bike shorts would look like.  Oh yeah, animal print is coming back in a major way, but not only in its O.G. black-and-tan colors. It'll also appear in vibrant hues like red and purple in 2019. Here, Joan Smalls demonstrates a major leopard mood for the Tom Ford runway show. Wherever leopard print goes, zebra print is sure to follow. The pattern will have a major influence in 2019. Here, a model wears it in a sequined mini for the Christian Cowan show. Suits have really been riding a serious popularity wave for the past couple years, but in 2019 they'll be full of color and funky patterns. This model illustrates a perfect version of the trend on the Hellesey runway show.

			 Harry maybe told Meghan she can't wear a suit on their upcoming Australian tour and IDK how to feel. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Meghan Markle loves herself a good suit moment, so she could be a tad frustrated if this report that Prince Harry has vetoed a tuxed0-inspired look for their upcoming royal tour of Australia is true. According to the Daily Mail, Meghan wanted to wear a Stella McCartney suit for a formal evening event Down Under. Harry, who reportedly likes to give Meghan fashion tips, wasn't into it and maybe told her not to wear it. The reasoning could have to do with the fact that the queen prefers skirts over trousers in general. "Meghan is being told she needs to stop dressing like a Hollywood star and start dressing like a Royal," a source reportedly told the Daily Mail. "Meghan wanted to wear a tuxedo-style suit but Harry said it wasn't traditional enough." Though dresses and skirts are strongly encouraged, it's worth noting that Prince Harry's late mother, Princess Diana, was often seen in tuxedo-like garb. Shop some suits below just because!

			 Wow, 1983 was an interesting year. One-pieces and bikinis have changed a lot over the years, going from super simple to crazy cutouts, metallics, and embellishments. Find out which suit was the most popular the year you were born! Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Swim tops that looked like bras were a Major Thing  in the early ’70s. So were fold-over bottoms. The lower the plunge, the better in 1971—take this green design, for example. This kind of halter, which starts in the center and then ties at the back of your neck, was a big deal throughout the ’70s. Not enough for just your top to match your bottom—your whole outfit had to be the same pattern in 1973. Excuse me, but if you didn’t have a swimsuit with lace embellishments in 1974, you were definitely not part of the in crowd. A matching lace set? A huge plus. How low can you go? That was a very common question in 1975 when it came to the backs of one-pieces. The beach wasn’t just a place to wear a swimsuit in 1976, it was also a great place to showcase your ~style~. Big hats and glitzy jewels were necessary for a day in the sun. Sexy little cutouts, like the keyhole on this bright floral one-piece, were all the rage starting in the late ’70s. The little details, like knotted fronts, were important in 1978. By the late ’70s, teeny bikinis were more en vogue than ever and bandeaus were super hot. Take a look at this example from the Givenchy 1979 runway show. In the early ’80s, simple one-pieces were happening, particularly in black and white and with spaghetti straps. Classic designs started to get more colorful in ’81. Phoebe Cates pretty much changed the swimsuit game when she hit the screen in this teeny-tiny ruched red number in 1982’s Fast Times at Ridgemont High. All of a sudden, you saw copycats everywhere. Cates’s red suit wasn’t the only one influencing swimwear around that time. The following year, Princess Leia’s sexy gold number, although not actually a swimsuit, inspired many a bikini style. String bikinis were widely popular in 1984, particularly ones with triangle tops. The prevalent style continues to be on trend today. When you think of ’80s swimsuits, odds are you imagine something like this gray suit with a thick white belt from a 1985 editorial. And if you’re not thinking about belts, you’re definitely thinking about this kind of suit, with a scooped neck and back, which was immensely trendy in 1986. Either suit (belted or scooped) would have looked excellent when paired with excessive gold accessories, as Goldie Hawn’s 1987 movie Overboard demonstrates. By 1988, one-pieces were out of favor and two-pieces were very much à la mode—particularly bandeau-style bikini tops with high-cut bottoms, as Nicolette Sheridan illustrates here. Speaking of high-cut bottoms, they got even higher in 1989 with an added sexy detail: thong backs. Almost as a reaction to how much booty was showing the previous year, boy shorts became a popular option for people who wanted a tad more coverage at the beach. The year 1991 was all about neon swimwear, both in one- and two-piece designs. Baywatch debuted in 1989, and as it rose in popularity, so did its iconic red one-piece swimsuit. The style was all over the place by 1992. 1993 was the year of the logo, as Naomi Campbell demonstrates here. You would have seen all the luxury fashion house logos, including Dior and Chanel, all over the beach at this time.  Things got much more sparkly in 1994, when rhinestones became a popular embellishment for bathing suits. The mid-’90s were all about bold patterns and prints, as Kate Moss illustrates in this 1995 photo shoot. Oh, hey, Salma Hayek! Her stint in this sexy burgundy push-up suit in the 1996 movie Dusk Till Dawn inspired a host of bra-like suits that year. Pearl accents—in faux-necklace form and as rhinestone-like details—were huge circa 1997, as these models show. In 1998, swimsuit styles simplified a tad, going back to the classic string bikini, often with sweet polka-dot patterns. Things were back on the flashy track by 1999, when gold and gold chains became popular.

			 "Wait, is that really the same dress?" Over the past year, I've taken the same dress with me every time I've hopped a flight to a sunny destination — it's the perfect vacation outfit, and I get compliments every time I wear it. I'm not telling you this to brag. I'm letting you in on my secret getaway weapon: the Mara Hoffman Tie-Front Midi Dress. I love its somewhat unexpected color scheme and knotted cutout feature, which reveals some skin without showing it all off. I also like it because I can usually get away with wearing it more than one way (without anyone noticing it's the same style) while I'm traveling — a super valuable aspect in any piece of clothing you take on a trip. To prove its versatility to you, I embarked on my latest journey — to Cairns in northern Australia — intending to wear this one piece in four very different ways. I enlisted my best friend Megan, who was along for the trip, to document all the looks. Even she, at one point, thought I was tricking her: "Wait, is that really the same dress?!" Yes it is, and yes, it's awesome. Scroll on to see if any of the styles fool you.   This is the go-to way I wear this piece, and it's also the way the designer meant for it to be worn. When I slip it on in its regular form, I take care to tie it in a double knot super slowly, so I can control how the tails lay. I like them to be flat and show the contrasting yellow lining. I also like to show a little leg, so I usually button the skirt only about halfway, but you can button it all the way down, no problem. Slit, no slit — your choice! You can completely untie and unbutton this piece, meaning it easily can be worn as a floor-sweeping vest. When I wear it like this, it's usually because I want it to serve as a flowy swimsuit coverup, but you could also use it as a replacement for a duster, pairing it with a cute top and jeans. Just drape it over your shoulders, tuck in the front ties, and head out the door. OK, this option isn't the most mind-blowing, but lots of people forget that you can slip dresses over other pieces. At night, when the weather cools down, instead of layering a jacket over this cute look, I pair it with a white mock-turtleneck crop top, which makes the other bright colors in the outfit pop and highlights the fun cutout. This is the outfit that made my friend think I was pulling her leg, but I swear it's the same dress. All I did was untie the top part, and fold it beneath the skirt to hide it. I then twisted the skirt so the buttons cascaded down one leg instead of down the center. I also kept more of the buttons undone, to create a higher slit. Add a cropped tee, and you've got a cool, semi-casual look for dinner out. Because this dress is a few seasons old now, it's sold out at most online retailers. But it's still available on Rent the Runway in the colorful pattern I have and in a more neutral pink shade that's also very pretty. If you're not a Rent the Runway girl, you can try out the same styling tips on another button-down dress. Mara Hoffman actually makes quite a few pieces like this one, and other brands are into this look too. Button-down dresses, FTW. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Box bags, bow clutches and lots, and lots of color. Keep scrolling to find the perfect, trendy bag to go with ALL your cute fall outfits.  Hunter green was the "it" color for handbags this season, and for fall, the deep, earthy color totally makes sense.  The dark hue was found on bags in different shapes and styles, including this Oscar de la Renta bucket-shaped bag with a gold latch.  At Gabriela Hearst, the trend came in the form of this chic briefcase with modern, rounded edges and a simplistic top handle.  Adeam's runway show featured a bag with a furry detail on the handle. The dark green accessory matched the model's dress for a monochromatic look.  If you're the type of person who carries a sh*t ton of things in your purse, then you'll be happy to hear that oversized hobos are here for Fall 2018.  This unstructured grey style made an appearance on the Bevza runway.  This bright yellow version made a statement at Mansur Gavriel.  This light orange design walked down the runway at Victoria Beckham with one strap on the model's shoulder and the other hanging toward the floor, so you can really see how many belongings fit inside.  Clutches are classic, but the spin this season was adding a bow to the front that acts as a handle.   This floral design at Alice McCall featured scalloped edges and contrasted the model's dark patterned dress.   At Chiara Boni La Petite Robe, models walked down the runway with these simple bow clutches in black. Ulla Johnson's version of the design included a dramatically oversized bow.  The bucket bag has been a must for a few seasons now, but for FW '18, it has been reinvented as a simple cylindrical compartment with a singular, thick top handle.   This large brown leather style at Derek Lam features a large gold buckle.  Brandon Maxwell went smaller with his take on the style. The navy bucket bag was compact enough to carry like a clutch on the runway.  This bright yellow bucket bag was seen at Ulla Johnson, and had a large bow for its handle.  While colder months typically mean a uniform of black and gray, fall 2018 promises plenty of bright, cobalt blue bags to get you out of your cold-weather rut. The bold shade was seen at 3.1 Phillip Lim's runway show with floral details.  This cobalt box clutch appeared on the runway at Dennis Basso, where it really popped against the model's grey outfit.  Stuart Weitzman showcased cobalt bags with geometrical hardware in similar box shapes at the brand's fall preview. Take notes, everyone. School is back in session in fall, and backpacks that will actually fit laptops and notebooks are trending.  This colorful, furry version walked down the runway at Jeremy Scott.  Coach 1941 also showcased full-sized backpacks, including this dark green leather design with fringe tassels.  This studded backpack at Alexander Wang gave the classic look some edge.  Like a more fashion-forward of a retro school lunch box, these bags offer clean lines and a simple design for FW '18. This bright orange version at Calvin Klein's runway show had a long strap to wear over the shoulder or as a cross body.  Badgley Mischka's red version had a top handle with rhinestone details and a gold latch.  This navy box bag made an appearance on the runway at Negris Lebrum and featured a wide shoulder strap and gold hardware.  This season designers added texture to handbags with fur.  This black poof purse appeared at Oscar de la Renta dangling on a silver chain.  A structured, bright red version of the trend was shown  at Christian Siriano.  A white design with an equally furry handle was modeled on Philip Plein's snowy runway.  Snakeskin patterned bags took on bold colors during fall and winter runway shows and appeared in bright blues, reds, yellows, pinks, and more.  This structured, blue Oscar de la Renta bag featured a silver latch and elegant top handle.  At the Michael Kors show, a bright red snakeskin bag perfectly complemented this dress's floral print, and it featured a wide chain strap.  The trend took the form of an envelope clutch at Bibhu Mohapatra.

			 Being hands-free has never been so stylish. You might as well lug around your books, laptop, wallet, and whatever else you need in a backpack that's as cool as you are. Here, 17 styles that you'll want to carry all your things in.  A two-tone backpack will go with twice the colors, and the pink hue shows off the extra zippered pouch.   If you're looking for an untraditional backpack, try a woven one for a beachy vibe.  A white bag will pop against your outfits, and one that's fully lined also will stand the test of time.  Need a cute bag that also will fit your laptop? Look no further than a pink one with whipstitch details. A red leather bag that's not too big and not too mini is the perfect investment piece, and the drawstring opening makes it easy to open and close.  Who knew a chic, tasseled foldover backpack could provide so many extra pockets for storage?  For those who are drawn toward a sporty look, opt for a white, water-repellent bag with a black zipper contrast.  The only thing more cool than a millennial pink backpack is one that comes with a detachable clutch purse.  A black bag with rose-gold metal accents is classic and sophisticated, while extra outside zippers and interior pockets make it super functional.  A mini backpack is a great way to tote all your things hands-free while running errands, and they're deceptively roomier than they appear.  Nylon fabric protects your bag's contents, while a leather foldover opening and canvas straps make it durable. Surprisingly, all three materials go well together to create a unique, undeniably cool backpack.  A vintage-looking suede bag with a clasp opening ensures your backpack won't look like anyone else's, whether you're using it in or out of school.  You never knew you needed a convertible backpack until now — one with detachable straps that also can be carried like a top-handle bag will be your new favorite style for toting around all your necessities.  A black mini bag will go with everything in your closet — plus, on top of a drawstring closure, it also has a magnet one so your possessions are extra secure.  Not into solid colors? Instead, rock a cool bandana pattern on your bag, which also has three levels of zippered pouches and a cool chain detail on top.  An edgy and compact backpack with an extra clasp and leather trim makes a great accessory that completes almost any outfit.  If you love straying from more traditional backpack shapes, opt for a circular one that offers adjustable straps and is made in part from recycled plastic.

			 Tori Bowie is a Valentino model, too. Tori Bowie is early for her interview, but that’s no surprise—as the fastest woman in the world, she’s used to being first. As a 3-time Olympic medalist and the winner of the recent IAFF World Championships in London, Bowie is one of the few Instagram stars who can post #winning and actually mean it. But her victories aren’t just on the track, as this New York Fashion Week will prove. After starring in the last Valentino campaign (!) with runway veterans like Selena Forrest, the 27-year-old will appear at various shows and maybe even appear on some catwalks. (Stay tuned...) We met the Mississippi native before her latest fashion gig to find out about gym makeup, mind games, and how to work out when you’re feeling sick. Not at all. I think I first realized that I had the potential to be good in college. It wasn’t until then. Before that, I was really lazy. I hadn’t matured yet; you know what I’m saying? I didn’t really want to put the work in.    I think what sparked me to put in the work is when I went to the World Championships in 2014.   No. I mean, I made the team. I was there to do a long jump. I was ranked number one in the world, and I got there and got last place. I think that’s when I really changed… I was so down. I was hurt. I wasn’t expecting to lose… I mean, I didn’t even make finals. It was a surprise to everyone: to myself, to my coach—nobody knows what happened, to this day. I was confused, and at that point, I was willing to do anything, to change anything, to start winning again. My entire life changed at that moment.    I never know if I’ll win. I just know to do my best. It’s a mind thing, you know? When I’m on the starting line, I know everyone else on that line. We’re all nervous, right? We all want to win. But you want to be the person who can bury those nerves and act like they don’t exist. That’s what I do, even though I’m nervous, I try to pretend. You have to bury nerves, because they can either destroy you or give you that extra boost. You have to use your nerves in a good way. Don’t let them destroy you.    #ValentinoResort2018 @maisonvalentino ❤️🙏🏿😊😍😘 A post shared by  Tori Bowie (@1toribowie) on Oct 21, 2017 at 4:46pm PDT I was kind of a tomboy. I was the girl in middle school with the floods on—I wasn’t fashionable at all. Nails were my first love; they’re the thing I cannot go without. After I started loving nails, I started getting really into hair weaves and scarves, headbands... I changed my hairstyle every two to three weeks. Once a month felt like too little!    My coach thinks that, but it’s not true. I remember when I had a fro, he said, “That fro is gonna catch all the air and slow you down.” He thought it was going to act like a parachute. He was wrong, obviously!   I’m still not sure how exactly it came about. But it was a great opportunity! I mean, of course, you can’t turn down Valentino! And the experience was great, overall… I know now that modeling is tough; it takes a lot of hours and a lot of energy… I thought modeling was going to be, show up, take a few pictures, pack it up, go home. No. We were on site for like 12 hours!    I think we’re passed that. I think we’re allowed to be girly, if we want to be. It’s up to the individual and what makes us comfortable in our own skin.   Are you kidding? Of course! The first thing I pack for meets is my makeup bag!    Yeah, I haven’t had any issues. My mascara is waterproof, but it’s not fancy—it’s right out of the drugstore, and it works just fine for me. I do mascara, I do lipstick, I do eyeliner and a little powder, and I fill in my eyebrows because mine are a little thin… I love makeup. It’s always part of my [pre-game] routine.   Yeah, if it’s not serious, on some days if I’m not feeling well, I still end up going to the track. And most of the time, when I do the workout, I end up feeling better.    Knowing everyone’s working just as hard as I am makes me run. Someone’s coming to beat me, and I have to continue to work hard to keep my spot.    That’s a good question, but my answer is going to really shock you. How often do you think I change sneakers?   No, I train in the same sneakers for three months! Because I’m a sprinter, it’s not like my shoes wear out in an obvious way, like they might if you’re a serious distance runner. The distance runners are really particular about that kind of thing, actually—they keep up with exactly how many feet they’ve run in their shoes to the very T. They’re very detailed about it. But for sprinters, it’s fine every few months.

			 No bacon-flavored shaving cream here. Because guys are really hard to shop for—especially in groups. Here, 30 gift ideas that'll make them look stylish at the wedding, reception, and beyond.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! If you want a not-too-serious photo op, consider gifting everyone matching baseball caps for a fun post-wedding pic.  A crisp scent with notes of bergamot, sage, and ginger will have the whole groomsmen crew smelling ah-mazing.  They'll look so handsome with a navy and light-blue dotted silk bow tie. This one is available in six total color combinations so you can pick one that goes with their tux.  A belt with a brushed nickel buckle is both dressy enough for a wedding, yet casual enough for everyday wear.  They can store this metal card conveniently in their wallet and impress everyone when they use it to pop open a beer.  Designated bags for dirty clothes, dress shoes, chargers, and headphones make last-minute packing a cinch.   Whether they are expert bartenders or simply want to be more creative with their drinks, a full cocktail tool set is definitely the way to go.  If your groomsmen are into gadgets, a Google Home that's voice controlled and syncs to their phones, entertainment systems, and even their thermostats is the perfect gift.  Tangled up cords are always a hassle, so an organizer that sticks to any surface is a simple way to tidy up their desk or nightstand.  Sipping on whiskey has never looked *cooler* thanks to this glass that creates a diagonal ice cube wedge.  What's an interior jacket pocket without a cheeky flask inside? All the groomsmen will love these vintage-looking ones, and they'll no doubt come in handy later.  A brushed metal tie bar set with black, silver, and gold styles add a decorative touch to a sharp suit.  No, they can't take it with them while traveling on a plane, but the convenience of having a Swiss Army knife in the house is undeniable. Scissors? Check?  Screwdriver? Check? Bottle opener? Double check.  If the wedding requires bringing a carry-on bag, a travel-ready kit that includes shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion is ideal for light packing.  A water-resistant, durable duffle bag is something they'll use constantly, whether they're going away for a weekend trip or simply going to the gym.  The older you get, the more you appreciate socks, and the same is true for any groomsmen who want to make their whole look a little more fun.  If they're addicted to caffeine (aren't we all?), look no further than a pitcher that makes brewing their own iced coffee a no-brainer.  They can wear customized cufflinks with their initials to the wedding (and basically any other dressy occasion) thanks to their timeless look.  Convenient and stylish for traveling, they'll definitely get some use out of a Dopp with leather details and double the compartments.  A sleek embossed leather wallet with a metal money clip is one they'll totally want to show off whenever they take it out of their pocket.  The wedding pics will look so fresh when all the groomsmen are wearing the same Ray-Ban frames.  An earthy-scented candle will make a cozy day inside that much better. A thin corded bracelet with silver hardware is subtle, yet it adds a trendy touch to anyone's wrist.  They'll get so many compliments on a faceted crystal decanter, and it'll undoubtedly give their bar area a luxe vibe.  They'll have an excuse to have friends over every weekend with an easy-to-use grill that has five various cooking options and reversible plates.  A lavender-scented kit that includes a badger brush, oil, balm, and cream will make shaving a calming, relaxing experience for once.  If poker nights are a common occurrence in the friend group, then a chip set that comes in an aluminum case will make their living room feel like Vegas—or close enough anyway.  These two hues are probably staples in his closet, so a minimal watch that features both is one he'll wear all the time.  More often than not, wireless headphones don't look very cool, but these round sweat-resistant ones are so modern and the matching portable holder ensures they have a safe spot and won't get lost.  The breathable mesh fabric on these sneakers make them ideal for running, while the leather detail not only adds support but also gives them a stylish athleisure look.

			 The brand, KYA Swim, released a statement and is looking into the incident that took place at a casting.  Joia Talbott never had visited Miami before, but she and some fellow models recently made the trip from Los Angeles to the South Florida city to take part in Miami Swim Week, which began July 19. What Talbott didn't expect was the discriminatory and racist remarks she allegedly received at a casting call leading up to Swim Week for the brand KYA Swim.    Talbott says she and other black models were in line for a casting call, along with a few models who were not of color.  She alleges that the casting director looked at the line and pulled another woman, who Talbott says was "directing traffic" and letting models know when they could enter the casting room, off to the side to have a private conversation. After her talk with the director, Talbott says the woman pointed her out in the line and said, "You, your hair, no.” Talbott, who wears her natural hair in an afro style, asked, "Wow, really?" but says the woman didn't budge on her decision. According to Talbott, she was putting her shorts back on over her swimsuit so she could leave when the woman then told all the models in line, "No dark skin."  "That is what came out of her mouth. Quote for quote," Talbott says. Talbott says the woman said the casting was closed, even though a line of mostly white models was still waiting downstairs, waiting to be called up.  After Talbott and other black models were dismissed from the casting, she posted a photo on Instagram to share her experience. Facebook user Macaroni Tony reposted a video, which went viral, of Talbott's Instagram Story. "The reason why I spoke out about this was because this [casting] went over the top and overboard to let us know that we were not welcome due to our skin," Talbott says. She clarified that not all the models in the photo were in line for the casting, although most were.  On July 9, she posted an Instagram stating in the caption she was told she didn't "fit" the criteria for Miami Swim Week.  "We get chosen over every day, that just comes with the territory—either they like you or they don’t. That’s not what it is. I have very thick skin," she says, adding that her issue is more about the way in which the casting practices "went above and beyond to be disrespectful and degrading towards women of color."  The brand released the following statement:  According to the brand's Instagram page, models of color did end up walking  in the show. Cosmopolitan.com reached out to the Funkshion, the outside production company hired to run the casting call, for comment, but in a statement provided to the Miami Herald, Funkshion’s chief creative officer Natalija Stojanovic said the designers made the ultimate casting decision.  “As much as we push for diversity and inclusion in our shows, ultimately, it is the individual designers who make the final decisions on the model selections for their brands,” Stojanovic said. “While the incident that has been reported is unfortunate, we encourage the dialogue about representation of models of all types to happen. It is our goal to further push to break down existing barriers wherever we can.” Talbott, however, feels fashion houses should do even more, and that designers create diversity quotas with dark-skinned models to avoid public backlash.   "I'm not saying that no women of color walked Swim Week—they did, and I’m very very proud of them," she says.   Pablo Starr, owner of Fashion Week Online, which hosts the Miami Swim Week schedule released the following statement about the incident: “Miami Swim Week encompasses around 100 shows, created by roughly seven production companies, most of them great people. So whoever acted in this way will be found."  However, as unfortunate as this alleged incident is, fashion has made encouraging, albeit slow, strides toward inclusivity. The Fashion Spot’s latest Diversity Report found that New York Fashion Week's fall 2019 shows were the most diverse they've been, reporting that 37.3 percent of the models on the runway were women of color.

			 The brand says you can wear it "day in and day out" and we're ready to take them up on that challenge. As if we needed more to love about ThirdLove, the trendy bra company just announced a brand new super cozy cotton line.  SHOP NOW: 24/7 Cotton T-Shirt Bra, $68, thirdlove.com; Cotton Thong, $12, thirdlove.com; Cotton Hipster, $12, thirdlove.com The brand is best known for offering over 70 bra-sizes — including half cups — is adding a new t-shirt bra and two underwear cuts made with Pima cotton to its collection. In a press release, ThirdLove explained that the additions came at the request of customers who wanted “a comfortable cotton bra that women could live in, day in and day out.”  But is Pima cotton really that much more comfortable than the jersey fabric of ThirdLove’s  original t-shirt bra? Well, it depends ...  “Unlike other fabrics, Pima cotton is a type of cotton where the fibers are longer and more uniform, resulting in a softer and more durable fabric,” explains Lexie Sachs, a senior textile analyst in the Good Housekeeping Institute. “Shorter fibers can poke out, so they’re more likely to break off and don’t feel as smooth against skin.” So the brand’s newest offerings will be cozier if you prefer softer fabrics. But Sachs points out that cotton tends to absorb moisture, so it stays wet longer. It also doesn't stretch, so you'd want to wear these on cooler, less active days. Like other ThirdLove bras, the cotton collection comes in different hues, and band sizes 30-40 with cup sizes A-G. Head over to ThirdLove to see the new arrivals in all of the colors, and pick your favorite.

			 The makeup bags will have you like 💫😍. We love a Disney fashion collaboration as much as the next person, however, one thing they almost all seem to have in common is that that fail to acknowledge some of the Disney fam’s most iconic characters: the villains. Whether you love them or still love to hate them, there’s no denying the likes of Cruella de Vil, Ursula, and Maleficent are responsible for some of the most fabulously savage quotes of our childhood. I, for one, am still not over the time Maleficent called her subjects “poor, simple fools” and dubbed herself The Mistress of Evil. I mean, power move or what? So what better way to celebrate these characters than with some snazzy-themed accessories? Skinnydip London just launched a capsule range of neat phone cases and makeup bags, available online and in stores today, inspired by three of the sassiest baddies of all time. Whether you’re on the hunt for the perfect Christmas present or you just want to treat yourself, these affordably priced goodies are set to be utterly enchanting additions to your cart.

			 Just because. Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are reportedly engaged! They are also very rich, which means they may never have a wedding registry (though they could!). If they did have one, what should be on it? Scroll on to find out. The other day, Justin wore a pair of hotel slippers out in the wild, where they do not belong. Just saying, he should have a nice pair of slides that'll give off the same vibe but protect his feet from the random debris that literally could be anywhere on the streets of New York. Not knocking all these pics that Hailey and Justin already have, but it could be nice to get some shots from your own perspective. This camera comes with WiFi, so you can send your high-quality jpgs right to your phone and upload them to Instagram. Technology, right? OK, I realize this is a lot of cameras, but nobody should live in a world without an Instax, especially not these two, Insta-happy love-birds. A word to the wise: Don't shake the picture that comes out! It won't turn out as good! Obvi, if Justin and Hails are going to take a ton of pictures with their new Instax, they're going to need some cute frames for those sweet snaps! Hailey turned 21 in November, so obviously she and Biebs need a fully tricked-out piece where they can store all their wine, spirits, and accoutrements.  And if they're going to have a fully-stocked bar cart, they'll look like amateurs without the proper tools. This set comes with everything except a wine opener. Cheers, you two! Justin's 'stache is gone, but if it were to come back at some point, he should consider this beard oil, which will keep things hydrated and stylized.  Justin likes hockey, and presumably now these two could go to some games together. Hailey should have some cute fan clothes to wear! In the short span of their heavily rumored, on-again relationship-turned-reported-engagement, Justin and Hailey have been to the Hamptons and to the Bahamas (where the proposal reportedly happened!!!) and I'm just assuming that there must be more tropical getaways down the road. More bikinis and more swim trunks will be needed!

			 That was lightning-fast, actually. As you know, Kylie Jenner celebrated her 21st birthday—which was on Aug. 10—on Thursday, Aug. 9 with two very sexy, very pink looks. Literally THE NEXT DAY, e-retailer Fashion Nova earned its fast-fashion reputation by creating nearly identical pieces based on Kylie's two outfits and Kim Kardashian's custom Yeezy mini dress. I mean, can you handle this (scroll through)? They are so, so, so similar. The model even looks a little like a Kardashian sister. The collection is called "Birthday Behavior" and there's not a scheduled release date for it yet, but the brand's Instagram teased that it would be "Coming Soon." A piece inspired by Kylie's pink satin Peter Dundas dress, is called the "Twenty Fun Satin Dress" on Fashion Nova. And a number that looks astonishingly similar to Kylie's sparkly compression suit by La Bourjoisie, is dubbed "Birthday Bash Sequin Romper." A cutout look called "Cut To The Chase Mini Dress" is very close to Kim's hot pink getup. As of now, searching for those names on the site just turns up other dresses that are most likely filed under similar categories, but not these specific ones. The devil works hard but fashion nova works harder 😂 pic.twitter.com/pB65MCnruO Fans' minds were totally blown by how fast it all went down, with one even saying, "The devil works hard, but fashion nova works harder." True, TBH. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Can't stop. Everything is too cute. In case it wasn't on your radar, Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale ends August 5. That's just days away, people! Scroll on for the best  deals on the cutest stuff, but snag them quickly because they won't last long. A perforated mini tote with a shoulder strap is super versatile; plus, the neutral hue goes with literally any other color.  Ditch your circular cubic zirconia and diamond studs in favor of a pair of uniquely-shaped gold earrings.  Get in on the cat-eye trend with a pair of chic tortoise-shell sunnies— you'll not only protect your eyes from the sun; you'll look good doing it, too. There's no better reason than a sale to start stocking up on fall sweaters, like a red one with balloon sleeves.  Forget the classic little black dress when you can wear a sophisticated black jumpsuit with an illusion neckline and ruffle sleeves instead.  A floral dress that looks just as good during fall as it does in summer is definitely a piece you don't want to let slip away. Wear it with sandals and unbutton the top in warmer weather, and come cold weather, pair it with boots and on oversized blue cardigan.  Raincoats are very rarely flattering or fashionable, but a bright yellow one with snap pockets and an adjustable hood is both. Also, if you needed more convincing, the British brand is a favorite of Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle's.  A lot of peplum shirts can be plain (there's nothing wrong with that!), but if you're someone who loves extra details, add a tank with ruffles and lace straight to your cart.  If you love florals, you'll use any excuse to wear a peasant dress that has three different flowery prints.  Your feet will look so dang nice with a pair of bright red slides with a pink bow on them.  A spaghetti strap tank top is the opposite of formal, but the silky-soft fabric totally elevates the piece.  Striped pants are a great addition to your work wardrobe. Plus, the relaxed fit on this pair makes them just casual enough to wear when you're out of office too.  There's no better season to show off those shoulders than summer, so wear a light blue dress with cut-outs that also happens to have ruffles, buttons, slits, and a belted waist.  Ditch your too-tight skinnies for a pair of loose-fitting boyfriend jeans like these, and your life will be forever changed.  Studded silver details around the ankle and on the toe make a pair of otherwise simple black boots stand out.  If you wear your pair of staple denim cutoffs every day, switch up your summer style with a red button-skirt that will be your new favorite piece.  Nothing will make you feel more happy than wearing a yellow floral dress on a beautiful summer day.  This bikini top has an oceanic color scheme of aqua, navy, and white, which is obviously perfect for a seaside vacation.  A pair of high heeled mules are a great combination because they can be both dressy and low-key.  A dress you can wear in both the summer and fall is priceless–luckily, this red-and-black patterned one is less than $40.  Get the best of both accessory styles with a backpack-shaped crossbody bag.  A copper-colored button-fly will differentiate this pair of skinny jeans from the rest of the ones in your collection. Everyone has a special jewelry piece they wear all the time, and a dainty gold necklace with your initial is about to be yours.  A pair of classic leather shoes is made infinitely cooler with a unique detail on the heel.  Play up the edginess of a raw hemmed skirt by pairing it with pointy-toed ankle boots (see #15), and you've got yourself a lewk.

			 No pants, no problem.  Kendall Jenner is pulling off some amazing looks at the Cannes Film Festival in France. On Friday, she wore a COMPLETELY see-through dress, and on Saturday she was a babe in this black one-piece. That same day, she was photographed in a show-stopping white gown, and later that night, she was seen in a skin-tight metallic pink mini while out with Bella Hadid. And, continuing her Cannes fashion show, on Sunday night she wore a sparkly sweater — with no pants. The sequined, super-short sweater by Nicolas Jebran, which the model wore to a Fashion for Relief benefit, also had a plunging neckline, and she paired the statement sweater with black, pointy-toe heels. But taking fashion risks is nothing new for the supermodel — she's Kendall freaking Jenner, and she's just about worn every sheer, cropped, super-short, cheeky, and  daring look in the book.  Ken completed the look by styling her hair in loose waves and wearing bright blue eyeliner. If you suddenly have the urge to wear an embellished sweater as a dress (or something similar), shop below!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 They didn't seem to have a problem with other girls walking around uncovered. OK, let's get right into it: Anna O’Brien is a 33-year-old, NYC-based lifestyle blogger and founder of the site Glitter and Lazers. On Tuesday, she claims she was in Vegas shooting a swim lookbook in the lobby an undisclosed hotel after receiving permission and confirmation from said hotel's PR team. Things went south from there. According to Yahoo, Anna says she was allowed to shoot anywhere but the casino floor, so she proceeded to pose for her first look — a bikini — in the grandly decorated entry. But after she had taken just a few shots with her professional photographer, she claims a security guard came and told her to put something over her suit. "He told me to cover up, that I needed to put clothes on because I wasn’t allowed to be in a swimsuit," she told Yahoo. "I tried talking to him but he wouldn’t listen." Here's what she was wearing, BTW: Frustrated, Anna and her photographer headed back up to her room, put on a one-piece suit, and tried again. Then: “We were shooting in a different part of the lobby and another guard approached us and told us to stop,” she said. “I showed him the emails from the PR team but it didn’t make a difference. I didn’t like the assumption that I was lying about having permission. What did I do to indicate that I wasn’t worthy of trust and respect?”  I’m just going to keep posting Miami pictures until I dig out of the massive hole of writing that I keep chipping away at and some how miraculously only seems to grow in size. Maybe if I tunnel long enough I’ll end up with a free trip to China. However I would have to tunnel straight through boiling hot lava, endure insane amounts of pressure from colliding molecules and survive breathing toxic gas. But hey, I’ve ridden the New York subway during rush hour in the middle of summer, on a car with no AC. I ain’t scared of nothing.  #miami #writerslife #justkeepswimming #plussize #poolside 📸 @larabellenewyork A post shared by  Glitter (@glitterandlazers) on Apr 5, 2018 at 3:59pm PDT Anna thinks it was about more than just the fact that she was wearing a swimsuit in the lobby. "Other women were walking around with as much coverage as me and no one said anything to them," she said. "I don’t want to think the worst of people but in cases like these, I can’t help but wonder."  I would like to give a huge shoutout to the Miami South Beach lifeguard who let me commandeer his tour to take this epic photo. My rainbow plaid @modcloth swimsuit against these bright beach colors makes me so so happy. Can everyday look like today please?  I’m so lucky to have an amazing friend in @larabellenewyork (she captured this delightful collision of color) who’s passion for photography and capturing real women just they are has inspired me to live life even bolder than ever before. #miami #southbeach #plussize #beachlife #surfsup #rainbow  @liketoknow.it http://liketk.it/2v3vo  #liketkit  #modclothsquad #ad A post shared by  Glitter (@glitterandlazers) on Mar 20, 2018 at 8:37am PDT She got a great photo out of the whole situation anyway, which she posted to her Insta feed on Wednesday, along with this powerful caption:   I find it ironic that I’ve taken photos in swimsuits all over the world and the one place I was told to cover up was Las Vegas. Sure, thin girls in thongs and pasties are A OK but a plus girl in a full coverage suit, trying to take an epic editorial shot- now that’s just too much. Jokes on them though, I’d already gotten the perfect photo. They can’t erase this happened. I’m learning as I push myself to do more editorial type concepts, the push back is greater. But that’s why I push. It’s more than just a girl in the city of sin in a bikini, It’s a statement. We will be seen. We’re not hiding anymore. And we’re going to wear whatever we want, wherever we want. Not just in Vegas. EVERYWHERE. Change is coming; the question is are you going to stand in the way or help us push through?

			 Yet, somehow I still continue to wear these things. What is wrong with me? When one of my oldest friends asked me to be her maid of honor, I burst into tears. For one, I was surprised to be asked. We’ve been living in different cities since 2005, and I was beyond flattered to be the person she thought of for this role. I was touched. What I didn’t realize was that assuming this honor would leave me with nerve damage in my left thigh. For months.  Okay, yeah, let me back up. So Christine asks me to be in her wedding, and I cry. Then she tells me about the maid-of-honor dress she has in mind, and I consider crying again. Why? Lemme put it this way: During her bachelorette party, Christine informed a drag queen about this particular frock and was promptly r-o-a-s-t-e-d.  “They’re long, dark hunter-green crepe gowns,” Christine proudly explained to the drag queen. The queen gasped. “And you’re getting married in Florida? In JUNE? You shady, shady b*tch.” June comes along and I go to the wedding and wear the dress—complete with full-body shapewear underneath, of course. Specifically, the kind of shapewear that goes all the way up to your underboob and down to your mid-thighs. Hey, it’s an unforgiving dress and I am the subject of many a professional photograph so I am left with few choices. In the aggressive, steamy 102-degree heat, I sweat like I’m in hot yoga. My body does its best not to expand, even though I got dressed at noon and wore the entire getup for 13 straight hours.  The wedding was beautiful, just as I knew it would be, but naturally, the second I got back to my hotel room, I peeled off my clothes and broke free, feeling nothing but empathy for Victorian women who had to wear corsets before the advent of the air conditioner. A few nights later, I’m back in my Brooklyn apartment when I notice what appears to be a little bug bite on my left thigh. I go to scratch it and the weirdest thing happens: I can’t feel what my fingers are doing. An entire section of my left thigh is completely numb.  Huh, I think to myself, growing a little nervous. Weird. Days later, the bite’s still numb. That’s when I start to get nervous and do a quick WebMD search. I learn I’m either pregnant, I’m riddled with a full-body cancer that will kill me within hours, or I have a common cold. None of these feel totally right to me so I do what anyone in my position would do—I text everyone I know who’s currently in medical school or has graduated from a medical-adjacent school in the last decade. The weirdest thing happens: I can’t feel what my fingers are doing. They all get back to me. Most of them ask the same questions—is the numbness tingly? No. Is it traveling? No. Do I feel warm or lightheaded? No. Am I having continence problems? Lol, no. Am I feeling sick? Nope. Do I often wear tight jeans or stockings? No.  Wait. Yes, I tell them. I explain the whole debacle—the wedding and the shapewear and the tight dress and the heat. “Bikini brief syndrome!” Leah Blowes, my friend, offers. (She’s a medical student at New York Medical College, so she knows what she’s talking about.) “It sounds like you compressed part of your lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.” She goes on to ask if the outside of my thigh, above the knee but not totally up to my hip, is where I’m numb. When I confirm, she tells me that yes, that’s the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.  Blowes explains that bikini brief syndrome—meralgia parasthetica, as it’s formally known—is a relatively common result of wearing “too-tight clothes” and that it usually takes a long time to go away.  “Weeks?” I ask nervously. “Months,” she texts back. You run the risk of damaging nerves every time you slip on shapewear. My physical therapist David Gershkovich corroborates her theory. “We call it MP for short,” he tells me. He also tells me I’m lucky; MP often comes with tingling, burning, and pain. Considering my case is only noticeable to the touch should give me a small amount of comfort.  According to the latest Mayo Clinic research Gershkovich reads to me over the phone, there are 4.3 cases of MP for every 10,000 patients. And it’s actually more common in men than in women. Huh, well, the more you know? Today I learned...too much compression is definitely A Thing, and it seems like I had crossed the line on that fateful, sweaty June day in hot-as-heck Florida. Gershkovich, although he claims to understand the lure of compression clothing, warns that you run the risk of damaging nerves every single time you slip those wily pieces of spandex on—regardless of the brand or style you choose.  He recommends ditching shapewear and tight clothing altogether. But, sorry doc, I LOVE SHAPEWEAR and have worn it on a bunch of occasions, even after this happened to me!  “It won’t happen to most people,” Gershkovich assures me. Then again, it did happen to me. So yeah, I get why this tale might freak you out.  It’s been five months and my left thigh is still numb to the touch. But Gershkovich has assured me that this won’t last forever, and I should regain feeling in a few months or so. Until then, I keep looking at that maid-of-honor dress in my closet and shaking my head, laughing. Shady, shady b*tch, I hear the drag queen say. Shady, shady b*tch. SKIMSskims.com$80.00  SHOP NOW

			 You'll DEFINITELY recognize some of these.  From embellished miniaudières to oversize tote bags, handbags will only continue to evolve as the times (and trends) change. Here, a look back at the 50 purses that immortalize each year.  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (i.e. Liz and Dick) were spotted leaving their hotel in Paris, but her quilted bag really stole the show. The pattern was widely popular and seen on practically every purse.  More bohemian and casual styles gained traction in the '70s, like shoulder bags with wider, longer straps. They were also larger and usually featured buckles, like this one on Candice Bergen.   Princess Margaret—and every other member of the royal family, TBH—always brought a purse with her whenever she went out, and this patent-leather number was no exception. The material was a prominent part of British fashion trends in the '60s and became even more popular in the following decade.  Rectangular briefcases weren't just for work; it became the accessory women brought with them everywhere, and it was more practical than a tiny handbag for stashing all your stuff.  A year later, larger bags were still in style, this time in the form of weekenders. They were the ultimate accessory if you wanted to be stylish while traveling—after all, who doesn't want to look like a jet-setter?  Exactly like the name implies, these purses resembled clams but came in suede, reptilian patterns, and any other material you could think of.  Queen Elizabeth really made the case for bright white purses in '75—she was often spotted with this bag and similar ones when traveling and attending official events. Here, she brought the accessory with her on a visit to Mexico.  Beige and neutral bags hit the scene next, and keeping it in the royal sphere, Queen Fabiola of Belgium toted this one with her while on official duty with King Baudouin. She even matched it to her leather gloves.  She was beauty, she was Grace...and she had her own Hermès bag named for her. The Kelly bag is still around today and remains one of the brand's most popular silhouettes.  For a more casual bag, straw was a go-to material. The textured purses made a huge comeback during the summer of 2018, but they also were the *thing* in '78. This woman looked beachside chic as she paired her tote with equally cute espadrilles.  Woven leather purses followed suit after straw bags, as seen here on Valerie Velardi, Robin Williams' then-wife.  By the time the '80s rolled around, it was all about loud and flashy fashion. For handbags, that manifested itself in the form of metallics, as seen on this gold crossbody on a club-goer at New York City's infamous hotspot Studio 54.  Gucci named this shoulder bag for the iconic former First Lady Jackie Onassis, and it was just as effortless and as sophisticated as she was.  Bamboo top handles were super durable, and the vintage-looking accessory has made quite the comeback in recent years thanks to Gucci, as seen on the runway in this image.   Ever heard of a little TV show called Cheers? Diane Chambers, played by Shelley Long, had the best style (she really loved a good blazer) and was often seen carrying an envelope clutch.  A Louis Vuitton bag is often the go-to airport carry-on for celebrities, but it was particularly chic when Audrey Hepburn did it in '84.  No matter the shape or silhouette, 1985 was the year of the LBB, or the little black bag. Here, Sigourney Weaver paired hers with an LBD and matching gloves at the Tony Awards.  In 1981, Dooney & Bourke branched out of making belts and suspenders and moved onto handbags, and just a couple years later everyone was wearing the brand's leather purses, like this beige and tan cross-body.  Prada's classic black backpack (pictured here in a pink mini version) was so utilitarian with its buckles and waterproof material that it became an accessory staple for years. Chainmail became the trendy thing to wear in '88, and the slinky, heavy material found its way onto bags, like this little drawstring pouch. It wasn't as flashy as rhinestones in the '80s but was eye-catching nonetheless. The Golden Girls were possibly the biggest fan of wicker bags and were, in part, responsible for their widespread popularity.  Super elongated clutches were a style that encapsulated the '90s, and you'd often see them, like this black version, on the red carpet at award shows.  In '91, odds are you wanted a bag that matched your entire ensemble from head to toe, similar to Sarah Jessica Parker's neutral satin purse that went with her sequin dress and shawl.  Oprah's best accessory (other than her longtime boyfriend Steadman Graham) was perhaps this yellow bag with a fancy rope strap that she carried to the Emmy awards. It wouldn't be the early '90s without Jansport backpacks. The old-school bags were spotted on campuses everywhere—often decorated with Sharpie drawings and iron-on patches.  The '90s were a wild time for fashion, because fanny packs were considered fashionable. But just think of the function and convenience of fitting all your essentials in an easy-to-reach pouch! Even Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was a fan back in his glory days.  This was the boxiest bag in the best way possible, and it seemed like everyone owned one. The late Kate Spade designed the waterproof nylon purse when she started the company in 1993, and it became so iconic that it was relaunched in 2018, seen here.  The '90s were a time of OTT outfits and accessories, so loud, animal printed purses were the next logical step in the evolution of It Bags. Here, Naomi Campbell carried a leopard-print design while out in New York City.  The late Princess Diana was the queen of clutches—she even used them for a secret trick! But chic satin ones, like this powder-blue bag, were definitely her fave. The '90s were associated with severe minimalism (think spaghetti-strap tank tops, slip dresses, mules, etc.), including super thin-strapped cross-body bags, much like Jennifer Lopez's here.

			 The swimsuit competition is gone, but good luck persuading beauty queens to part with their sequins and velvet fishtail skirts! The newly-rebranded "Miss America 2.0" pageant competition will no longer feature a swimsuit round, and Miss America Organization chair Gretchen Carlson has promised the state titleholders competing for that tiara will no longer be judged "on their appearance" alone. But the evening gown competition will still be a part of Miss America, this year with a theme of "red carpet glamour."  During the gown round, contestants will now also be offered an opportunity to speak about their platform, the advocacy and awareness work all titleholders undergo with a view to promoting a particular cause.  The 2019 Miss America competition airs tonight at 9/8c on ABC. See more photos from the preliminaries at the Miss America Facebook page.

			 Noooo!   For over a century, L.L. Bean has been famous with shoppers for its return policy ... until now. The retailer announced on Friday that it was putting a stop to the policy, which let people return any item, for any reason, even if they had it for years.  The reason for the change? People abusing the system. The company wrote in a Facebook post that too many people took advantage of their leniency. Some people would pick up L.L. Bean products at yard sales or Goodwill, then bring them back to the store, and others would return their items every year to exchange them for the latest versions.  "Increasingly, a small, but growing number of customers has been interpreting our guarantee well beyond its original intent," they wrote. "Some view it as a lifetime product replacement program, expecting refunds for heavily worn products used over many years. Others seek refunds for products that have been purchased through third parties, such as at yard sales." Going forward, L.L. Bean customers will have one year after buying an item to return it, and you have to have proof of purchase. After one year, the company said it will "work with customers to reach a fair solution if the product is defective in any way."  Leon Leonwood Bean, L.L. Bean's founder, is credited with launching the policy when 90 of his first 100 hunting shoes were returned. He earned goodwill by returning customers' money, and he came back with a better boot. Thus the satisfaction guarantee was born. But in 2018, executives at the company say their return policy just wasn't sustainable for their business anymore. "The numbers are staggering," Steve Smith, the company's CEO, told The Associated Press. "It's not sustainable from a business perspective. It's not reasonable. And it's not fair to our customers." Over the last five years, L.L. Bean lost $250 million on returned items that were so low quality, they had to be destroyed rather than donated.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.

			 My closet is complete!!!  This week alone, we clocked everyone from Amal Clooney to Rosie Huntington-Whitely wearing the hottest trend of the season: knee-high boots. Lucky us: On the heels of launching the perfect ankle boot just last month, Everlane finally produced a knee-high pair that checks all the boxes. Praise be!!! The sustainable brand claims that the boots’ traditional retail value would be priced at more than $520, but it is selling them for just $250.  For something as basic as these, we predict that strangers will be constantly stopping you on the street asking their origin story. Because, like, look at them...how could they not?!What have I been wearing this winter before I met these boots? I don’t know if it’s Everlane’s dreamy studio lighting, but they just look sooo smooth. Wow, I finally get why everyone is always describing leather as “buttery.” They are so chic, they look just like their runway counterparts but without the runway sticker tag.    The San Francisco–based label tends to stick to the classics, so these boots mark a more trend-forward approach. This style is all about a clean silhouette, which Everlane nailed with this drop. They fall in line with the fashion industry’s ongoing love affair with the ’70s, so we plan to style them with prairie midi skirts and suede fringe ASAP.  There’s no bulky side zipper on these knee-highs, so they won’t slouch awkwardly at your ankles and pinch as you walk, but the wide shaft and back pull tab allow you to easily slip them on over jeans. The brand released the style in three easy-to-wear colors. The bone-white boots remind me of vintage go-go boots, but the black and camel colors will be your new everyday shoe. Like Everlane’s other leather offerings, these boots are made in Italy from Italian leather. Designer brands who?

			 Yaaaaaaassssssssss! Cardi B went all-out for her first-ever Coachella concert over the weekend, paying homage to iconic girl group TLC with her all-white outfit. Here's the look she was going for: And here she is, slaying the hell out of it:   Her dancers also had TLC vibes, wearing custom pieces by the group's 2018 tour costume designer, Brea Stinson. Everyone looks fly as hell. Honestly can't get enough of these pics. They are so much fun. Apparently, though, playing at Coachella is a total money suck and costumes and set design like this don't come cheap. In a recent interview, Cardi revealed that she's actually losing money on the gig. "I'm getting paid for Coachella like 70 [thousand] a day," she told SiriusXM. "I have to invest so much money on my stage set — my own money that I have to go to Wells Fargo and write a check. It's crazy. Almost $300,000. "It's an investment," she said. "You've got to take that. You've got to take that to the chin. But it's like, 'Dammit. Right after I finished paying my damn taxes!'" It's all worth it though, because she flat out killed it. Get 'em, Cardi. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 This is one inexpensive gown. Prom season is upon us, and if you haven't already found your dress (or, if you need a look for another formal occasion), you might want to listen up, because there's a $4 DIY gown out there going viral. Amber Scholl, a 24-year-old blogger, is not a teen headed to a dance, but either way, she decided to test her skillz and make a totally elaborate floor-length piece fit for prom. All she needed to accomplish this was a $4 dress, which she purchased from Good Will, some thread, a needle, and a little over $100 of craft supplies (like crystals, glue, and feathers).  Please take a look at the before and after pics here. $4 thrift store dress is now my dream prom dress 💁🏻‍♀️#DIY ✂️🖤 pic.twitter.com/dDxi8gqc3o Basically, Scholl took a plunging black skater dress, sewed the skirt to be more ~bodycon~, and added tons of feathers and sparkle to make the finished lewk. A statement necklace topped off the whole ensemble. If you want to know exactly how she did it, check out the YouTube video she posted, titled, "DIY THRIFT STORE PROM DRESS MAKEOVER!" (!!!!) In it, she admits designing dresses is a completely new territory for her: "Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm doing. I've never really done this before."  "I knew it would be fun to show my subscribers how to get creative and do it [prom] for less," Scholl told Yahoo. "There's no reason prom and life in general can't be made fabulous on any budget." So true, girl. Next time, show us how to do a wedding dress, plz. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 The Chanel creative director passed away today at 85 years old.  On Tuesday, renowned fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld passed away in Paris at the age of 85. He had been the creative director of Chanel since 1983, but he was also known for his iconic signature style: white hair pulled back in a ponytail, oversize sunglasses, and black suits and ties. Even his beloved cat, Choupette, became somewhat of a celebrity. He also designed for Fendi and headed his own eponymous fashion label. Although the cause of Lagerfeld's death has not yet been confirmed, he missed the fashion house's most recent haute couture show last month leading to speculation that he was in poor health. Since the news broke, celebrities, models, and other designers have been reacting to his death and paying tribute to the legendary (but also controversial) designer.   this one hurts to write. my dearest Karl, you have taught me things that I am eternally grateful for.

I sent the interview to my French girl friend to translate and was elated you knew of my existence. Years later during fashion week in Paris you and your family walked into the restaurant my team and i were in and sat at the table next to us. All i could do was stare as this legend was sitting an arm stretch away. I got up and walked passed your table only to go to the bathroom and check my hair before strutting to your table and introducing myself. You told me you knew who i was and that the grace i walked with reminded you of a young Naomi Campbell. Wow.. those words will ring in my head forever and they tell me that no matter what i need to continue working hard for my dreams. I’m happy i got to know what you thought of me. You’re greatly missed. I’m honoured to have ever been in your presence. Sending my love to the Lagerfeld family, you’re in my prayers 🙏🏽💔 A post shared by  ♔Jamaican Canadian♔ (@winnieharlow) on Feb 19, 2019 at 5:09am PST  So incredibly sad to hear this.

			 Remember that one time she rode in on a horse? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. If there's anyone willing to take a fashion risk, it's Lady Gaga. The singer is the very definition of a style icon, and she's always pushing the boundaries. I mean, who else do you know would wear a dress made out of raw meat? There are so many crazy looks that Gaga has worn throughout the years, but we've taken it upon ourselves to round up her most outlandish outfits...so far.

			 The reigning queens of matching outfits.  Before Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were the award-winning fashion designers behind brands The Row and Elizabeth and James, they were ’90s and ’00s style icons. Here, a look back at some of the sisters’ most stylish moments.  When they made the ultimate fashion statement with these sweaters tied over their printed dresses.  When they wore these paisley dresses for a photo shoot.  When they looked ready for Christmas in Santa hats, scarves, and mittens.  When they got tatted up on Full House.  When big bangs and Barney were the best combo.  When they went for this nautical striped look with coordinating hats.  When they looked adorable in overalls and bandanas in their hair.  When they were so precious it hurt.  When they had these hats.  When they wore floral to the It Takes Two premiere.  When they had haircuts like this.  When they wore this to the Spice World Hollywood premiere.  When they curled their hair under and wore side parts with clips.  When they wore random braids and clips in their hair like in Switching Goals.  When all this happened.  When they wore floating flower clips. When they dressed like Avril Lavigne. When they wore tube tops.  When they wore their hair wavy at the roots and straight on the ends. When they would match everywhere they went.  When one of them would wear their hair curly and the other would wear it straight.  When their hair was wavy and pinned back like this.  When they would crimp their hair like this.  When they would match but not really.  When they used to always smile in photos.  When Mary-Kate was a bohemian goddess. When they wore all this all at once.  When they made messy hair a desirable thing. When they made their big screen debut in New York Minute. When Mary-Kate went brown and you could finally easily tell them apart.

			 The influential fashion mogul died at age 55. Kate Spade, an influential fashion designer based in New York, was known for her colorful, classic, and cheerful designs. On June 5, 2018, at age 55, she was found dead of apparent suicide in her Manhattan apartment. Scroll on to learn more about her life, her family, and her career.  1. Her maiden name was Brosnahan.

Brosnahan graduated from Arizona State University with a journalism degree in 1985 and quickly moved to New York, where she got a job in the accessories department at Mademoiselle magazine. In 1991, she left the publication. By that time, she had risen to the title of senior fashion editor and head of accessories. 3. She married Andy Spade in 1994. The two met while working a men's clothing store in Phoenix, Arizona. Andy Spade, an advertising executive, is actor David Spade's brother.    4. Her clothing company originally just made accessories. In 1993, two years after leaving Mademoiselle, she started a design company called Kate Spade Handbags, which initially just sold bags and later expanded to jewelry, shoes, clothing, stationery, eyewear, fragrances, home decor, dinnerware, and more. 5. In 2006, she left her namesake company. She sold her remaining stock in Kate Spade New York to Neiman Marcus, who already had a majority share in the label, and used the free time to raise her daughter, Frances, now 13. 6. Ten years later, she started a new brand, Frances Valentine. The label focused on luxury shoes and, once again, handbags.  7. Coach, Inc acquired Kate Spade for $2.4 billion dollars in 2017. In May 2017, Coach, also known as Tapestry (a luxury group that also houses Stuart Weitzman), bought Kate Spade New York, which had been sold to Liz Claiborne Inc., later called Fifth & Pacific, in 2006. Brosnahan didn't see any of that money, having been bought out a decade prior. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 Your ratty, faded bikini’s calling. It’s ready to retire. Oh, so you think summer’s basically over and you don’t have to think about swimsuits anymore? Well, do you, but FYI: Miami Swim Week and the Destination Miami Tradeshow (aka a very hot and bikini-focused fashion week that takes place every year in Florida) just happened at the end of July and...you’re definitely going to want to see all the latest trends and get some great inspiration for all your Labor Day plans. Keep scrollin’ to check out 50 styles that are perfect for your next poolside soiree.   Retro sportswear style reigned at Miami Swim Week, from super-high-cut bottoms to sport color palettes and tees knotted as swim tops.  Sage Swim This version in red by Solid & Striped is fun with modern cutouts and a sport zipper. This T-shirt twist is retro and sporty. The high-cut bottoms have that ’80s retrospect feel. This checkerboard one-piece is available now at Topshop and features serious cutout action. Vroom, vroom. The reflective belt and buckle make this otherwise simple suit ready for the speedway. This alternative high-shine material is sleek and high sport. You will definitely be turning heads in the waves. Rawr! Animal prints will always be sexy, and everything from leopard to zebra was fierce on the catwalks this season.   Vitamin A This sustainable one-piece doubles as a bodysuit, so you can try it with your favorite black denim or rock it solo at the beach. This knot-front zebra suit features telltale black-and-white stripes and high-cut bottoms. A cheetah-print bandeau bikini in soft gray is fuego, obviously. If you can’t make up your mind on which print you prefer, try a combo suit like this one. The top of this leopard bikini has underwire cups for a lil lift and support, and the high-rise briefs give it a vintage vibe. Think of this trend as a vibrant party piece to wear to your next beach rave—you know, because you’re going to so many beach raves. The runways had so many sparkly materials like glitter, Lurex, metallic foils, and embellishments.  Nookie Beach This one-shoulder blue look will make you gleam as you sunbathe. You’ll definitely turn heads at the beach in this silver bandeau and high-waisted brief. Really stand out in this shiny tricolored bikini with a fun twist-knot detail in the top. One-shoulder suits were a big trend at the shows too. This silver number combines two major swim-week moments in one. Is this Lurex bikini disco heaven, or is it disco heaven?! Unsurprisingly, neon colors were all over the Miami runways this year. VDM the Label This highlighter version has a sleek cutout slit with cute spaghetti straps. This neon-blue bikini gives off major Bond Girl vibes, right? Try this three-quarter-sleeve suit with a pair of oversize shades and get ready to receive all the compliments. This super-high-cut one-piece will make you feel like you traveled back from the ’80s in a time machine. Try this for a low-key version of the brights trend. Black-and-white came in many silhouettes this season. This is a swimwear color trend for minimalists. Acacia This swimsuit takes the two colors to a supercute place with fun silhouette work. Polka dots, ruffles, and crisscross straps. This black-and-white suit has everything. This two-tone suit is extra cool with its contrasting lace-up side detail. A one-piece black-and-white one-shoulder detail will be a standout piece in your swim collection. If you like a bit more coverage, this is the suit for you. It is available in a wide size range, and the crisscross straps in the front ensure everything stays put if you’re frolicking in the waves. This swimsuit trend is surf-girl-approved but also sun-protection-approved! Definitely perfect for getting one more hour of beach time before it’s too cold.  Natasha Tonic This houndstooth long-sleeve suit is just rad. You can use it as a bodysuit too! This floral print is perfect for when the surf’s up, and the zipper detail means you get to control how much cleavage you want to show. Yep, they come in two-pieces too. How badass is this neoprene style? This white, pastel-blue, and tangerine version will protect you from the sun on ultra-active vacations. This picnic-patterned piece is perfect for a weekend at the beach, and the scalloped edges make it even more chic. Daring cutouts are also a superhot new swim trend to try. If you like one-pieces but want to reveal more skin, this is the silhouette to try next!  Bananhot America This two-tone color-block style has ties at the sides that you can adjust to show more or less skin. It’s also reversible, so you can come up with tons of cool new combos. This tube-top swimsuit has sliver-thin cutout panels. For a more revealing style, try this number that has stomach and shoulder cutouts. Ultimate ’80s vibes! Unbuckle the sides for a two-piece look or hook ’em back together for a monokini lewk. Say hello to the sweetest summer staple you’ll ever meet—this white one-piece with a tie-front closure and ultra-high-waist bottoms. An oldie but a goodie: tropical fruits and palm leaves were back in a big way at Miami swim week.  Sonya Swim You can match this with a fresh fruit cocktail. This high-waisted palm-print two-piece is so cute, and you can totally get away with wearing it as an evening top with gold jewelry and barely-there strappy sandals. How elegant is this floral-print halter? This palm-print one-piece has ruffle straps for a fun, frilly touch. If you like a ruffle, this suit is super cute for you! Pair it with a lemonade and get that fun pic for the ’gram. Tie-dye is a major fashion trend for 2019 and 2020. Get into it with these hot California-inspired swimsuits.  VDM the Label  The subtle ruching of this bikini top is super sweet. Unhook the straps to get a bandeau look and minimal tan lines. For a little more coverage, try a one-piece in a vibrant color, like this one. This racerback top paired with these high-waisted bottoms is graphic and bold. House of Holland x Speedo  At $30, you won’t feel bad about buying into this trend with a supercute one-piece style. If you like your tie-dye a bit more subtle, go for this micro-strap bikini style in mellow yellow. Invisible PVC straps give the illusion of a barely-there bathing suit.  Oh Polly This bandeau top has clear straps in the back. Pair it with the skin-baring bottom and you’ll def get noticed on the beach. The invisible paneling on this piece makes it simultaneously skin-showing and covering. For a style that’ll make people’s heads turn at the pool, consider this black one-piece with PVC straps. The classic triangle bikini, but different. This suit costs under $20 for the set, so IDK why it’s not already in your cart. This version has thicker straps for anyone who appreciates more support up top.

			 Including a sneak peek of one of the runway looks 👀 Welp, it's that time of year again, folks, and I'm not talking about the changing of seasons—I'm talking about the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Preparations are already underway, castings are complete, and the show is coming back to the United States! Below, everything you need to know about one of the biggest events in November—second only to Thanksgiving, of course.  The brand announced on its Instagram that the show will take place in the Big Apple, following a two-year hiatus abroad.  As you probably know, last year's show was held in Shanghai, China, and some women were reportedly denied visas to travel there, including Gigi Hadid, Katy Perry—who was originally confirmed as one of the event's performers—Russian models Julia Belyakova, Kate Grigorieva and Irina Sharipova, and Ukranian model Dasha Khlystun. The afterparty was also allegedly shut down by authorities before midnight. The year before that, the show was held in Paris.   So excited to have the VSFS in NYC this year! 😍 A post shared by  Lais Ribeiro (@laisribeiro) on Sep 17, 2018 at 11:10am PDT The live runway show takes place on November 8, but, it's taped, and will air the next month.   Last year there were five performers, but this year there's a whopping total of EIGHT, and it's perhaps the biggest lineup yet. In an Instagram post, Martha Hunt revealed that Shawn Mendes, The Chainsmokers, Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini, Rita Ora, Bebe Rexha, and The Struts are all confirmed to take the stage runway. To get you pumped in the meantime, here's some Shawn Mendes for you:  
 Both Gigi and Kendall are returning to the VSFS after missing last year's show. Kendall and Gigi made their debuts for VS in 2015, but due to Kendall's contractual obligations with competing lingerie brand La Perla (she starred in its 2017 Pre-Fall campaign), she didn't walk in Shanghai. Reportedly, Gigi Hadid was denied a visa for the China show due to a controversial Instagram video in which she imitated a Buddha statue, so she, too, missed last year's show. Shoe designer Brian Atwood said both would be strutting down the runway this year in an Instagram post.  Can’t wait to see this beauty @kendalljenner strutting in my shoes for the @victoriassecret fashion show... less than a month away!!!! #fashion #angel #victoriasecretfashionshow #victoriassecret #sexy #brianatwood #glamour #sickshoes #nyc A post shared by  ＢＲＩＡＮ ＡＴＷＯＯＤ (@brian_atwood) on Oct 19, 2018 at 5:00am PDT Bella Hadid, who did walk in last year's show, is also making her return and, in an Instagram post, wrote she is "so grateful to be a part of the show again." Veterans returning to the VSFS include Lais Ribeiro, Martha Hunt, Stella Maxwell, Leomie Anderson, Cindy Bruna, Georgia Fowler, Ming Xi, Grace Elizabeth, Devon Windsor, and Behati Prinsloo. Behati skipped the past two years to give birth to her two children with Adam Levine, Dusty Rose and Gio Grace, but her catwalk comeback was announced in October.  In an emotional Instagram post, Winnie Harlow announced that she's making her debut. "I had a break down before I walked into the most nerve wrecking [SIC] casting of my life," she wrote in her caption. But she explained that once she got to the offices and "made new friends and saw old friends" it "already felt like home."   I had a break down before i walked into the most nerve wrecking casting of my life. I asked my driver to go around the block twice before i could walk into the @VictoriasSecret offices so i could re coup, and remember (while my trainer @bodybymato reminded me on the phone through sobs - thank you lol) how hard I’ve been working! I went in and made new friends and saw old friends and it already felt like home! We patiently waited while @ed_razek @johndavidpfeiffer @monica.mitro @10magazine carefully took time to get to know each girl. When it was finally my time, within my nervous storm of anticipation i changed into a black Victoria Secret set and stepped out!!!! I spoke to them about Jamaica, @nick_knight , my abs, and how i was beyond honoured to be given the opportunity to try out.. then I walked for my life!!!! I can’t believe this!! Thank you for giving me all the energy and kindness in that room! Thank you for allowing me to walk for VICTORIA’S SECRET! Thank you to my agencies @firstaccessent @womenmanagementnyc @women_paris @thesquadmanagement my pr @remibrb my agent @mannyuk and mama bears #sarahstennett & @thelilmisse for having my back supporting and believing in me!

Super excited to announce that i am going to be walking in the VICTORIA’S SECRET FASHION SHOW 2018 !!! 🎉Thank you to everyone who believed in me (and who didn’t) @ed_razek @monica.mitro @10magazine @johndavidpfeiffer @victoriassecret for giving me this insane chance, forever grateful💗💗💗 A post shared by  Yasmin Wijnaldum (@yasminwijnaldum) on Sep 7, 2018 at 1:15pm PDT After 17 years of modeling in the show, she  confirmed her retirement in an Instagram post last year.   Words cannot describe how grateful I am to have been working for this amazing brand that inspires me and women all over the world. In my wildest dreams I would have never imagined doing 17 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows. Thank you Ed, and all my Victoria’s Secret family for making these memories unforgettable. Last night was so emotional to say goodbye to my #angel sisters but we put on the biggest and best show ever. I could not have done this without all the love and support from my fans. It gives me great pride to be part the Victoria’s Secret movement! I will always be cheering for you! Love you forever ❤️ A post shared by  Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Nov 21, 2017 at 3:20am PST Greek-born designer Mary Katrantzou will collaborate with VS to make a capsule collection that will debut on the runway. The London-based designer is known for her whimsical, colorful ensembles and use of pattern mixing, so she'll probably bring those signature elements to the lingerie. On Tuesday, November 7 the brand released a first-look of Josephine Skriver's runway outfit designed by Katrantzou, and it's pretty stunning:  Last year, VS partnered with Balmain and sent a bunch of studded, punk-inspired looks down the runway for a portion of the show. So, at the very least, this year's choice of designer is definitely a departure from that edgy aesthetic.

			 Rainy days, I’m ready 4 u.  I’m here with an extremely important update. There exists a boot that will keep your feet dry and your dignity intact the next time a massive rainstorm decides to drop by and ruin your day. This boot will not cost you a fortune. Nay, it’ll put you out the price of one cocktail at that fancy hotel bar your bougie friend always drags you to.  Allow me to introduce you to this magical piece of footwear:  Rain, rain, come my way, ’cause I’m ready as hell for you. I spent much of my early adulthood refusing to believe that I needed a special shoe for rainy weather. I'm stubborn, ok! Buying a whole separate item for the few days out of the year when I avoid going outside as much as possible seemed silly. But then I ruined a whole bunch of shoes and found these Chelsea boot gems and now I’m a total convert.    Remember when you were younger and your mom would tell you to dress for the weather, but you didn’t wanna ruin your outfit so you’d forgo the tights and jacket and end up shivering and feeling completely ridiculous? Or depending on how enterprising you were as a #Young, you would borrow your crush’s sweatshirt, which definitely ruined your look, but it didn’t really matter because it was your crush’s sweatshirt?! Yeah, well, those days are in the past. You’re an adult now and you need some rain boots. Make your mom proud.  Shop now

			 It comes in so many pretty colors!  Coach showed its Fall 2018 collection on Tuesday in New York City, where the brand debuted its new Dreamer bag, which became available for purchase after the show.  The bags come in two sizes (the Dreamer 21 is smaller) and are "inspired by romantics and the endless possibilities of New York City," according to a press release. They're available in multiple colors including red, light blue, green, purple, and black. They also feature three charms, including a feather-shaped leather studded one.  Because most fashion brands usually work six months in advance of seasons — Fall/Winter shows take place in February, and Spring/Summer shows are in September — some are adopting "see now, buy now" strategies in which customers can purchase items immediately after debuting in a designer's show. Coach's new bag falls in line with this business model, in which shoppers are eager to buy pieces directly from the runway.  The brand's Dreamer bags are crafted in glove-tanned leather and feature three compartments to fit and organize your lipstick, wallet, umbrella, lint roller, and whatever else you need to cram into your purse. (Because sometimes your handbag can feel like a black hole when you're digging around for five minutes to find your keys, right?) And the two sizes mean there's a purse for those who love a good mini bag, as well as for those who like the space that comes with a medium-size one. Shop some of Coach's new Dreamer bags below, and find the full line here.

			 Even Duchesses like Zara, OK?! Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton always step out looking fabulous, which makes sense because...it's kind of their job. I mean, sure, all those royal events are also about diplomacy and charity and whatnot, but if the whole shindig is going to get photographed, then they've got to dress the part too. And even though the sisters-in-law have every brand imaginable at their fingertips, we've noticed that they've developed some, well, preferences. Here are the designers they reach for again and again.  Poupette St Barth Elise Layered Long Dress, $490  SHOP SIMILAR Meg donned this gorgeous patterned gown by Carolina Herrera during a royal visit to Morocco, but it wasn't the first time she wore a piece by the designer. She donned this pale pink ensemble in June 2018 and this belted denim number in July 2018, both by the same brand. Stella McCartney Black Falabella Flap Wallet, $300 SHOP SIMILAR McCartney designed Meghan's stunning wedding reception gown, and since that fateful day, it appears the British designer has become a go-to for the Duchess. On International Women's Day in March, Meghan accessorized her Reiss dress with a chain-trimmed black clutch from the label.  Castañer Carina Wedge Espadrilles, $120 SHOP NOW When Meghan was in Australia last October, she wore this pair of Castañer espadrilles to a couple of royal engagements, but she had to take them off to navigate the sandy beach. You may also recall this event as the day Prince Harry touched Meghan Markle's thigh in public. The end.  Castañer Carina Wedge Espadrilles, $120 SHOP NOW  Meghan took the Castañer espadrilles out for another spin during the same royal tour, but this time she paired 'em with a colorful wrap dress by Figue. I want.  Krewe St. Louis Sunglasses, $235 SHOP SIMILAR Another fashion staple she wore Down Under was this pair of Krewe sunglasses, which she sported several times, including on a boat tour of the Sydney Harbor. The black frames with gold accents looked undoubtedly chic, and—of course—quickly sold out.  Lulu's Green Flounce Sleeve Dress, $49  SHOP SIMILAR  In February 2019, it was hard to miss Kate Middleton when she stepped out in this bright green shift by Eponine. The London-based brand loves a good retro-looking design, and evidently so does Kate—she also wore their gingham dress with button details in 2016.  Monki Polka-Dot Tiered Midi Dress, $40 SHOP SIMILAR Guess what? Kate shops at Topshop. Kate wore this black-and-white polka-dot dress while she was pregnant with Prince George in 2013, and then she wore another look by the affordable U.K.-based brand during a royal tour of India in 2016. Sledge Leather Pumps, $345  SHOP NOW Kate is frequently spotted wearing the brand's popular neutral "Sledge" pumps made of patent leather, as seen here in 2011. The label also makes clutches and clothing, which she's worn on several occasions. Red Tassel Earrings, $44 SHOP NOW The Duchess has sported several Kate Spade pieces, like these vibrant red tassel earrings that she wore to a fundraising event in 2017.  She also wore a polka-dot dress by the designer the day after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement announcement. Cute.  East/West Bi-Color Bag, $775 SHOP SIMILAR Meghan launched Strathberry into the public spotlight when she wore the label in the weeks following her engagement announcement. Since then, she hasn't stopped wearing the Spain-based brand's leather purses with gold accents, like this forest-green crossbody that she matched to her coat while on a visit to Scotland. Lawson Trench Coat, $199 SHOP NOW She wore this green trench by the Canadian-based chain to the U.K. Team Trials for the Invictus Games with Prince Harry. Later, she also wore a burgundy dress by the retailer. Lace Detail Dress, $475 SHOP SIMILAR Kate notably wore a neutral sheath by Reiss when she met the Obamas in 2011. She paired it with a clutch and black heels while speaking with then-First Lady Michelle Obama.  Azzura Swirl Printed Shift Dress, $345  SHOP NOW Kate isn’t the only one who has a thing for Reiss. Meghan turned heads when she wore a loud printed turtleneck dress from the British designer to a panel for International Women’s Day in March of this year. Spirit of Grace Polka-Dot Print Surplice Wrap Dress, $58 SHOP SIMILAR The baby blue polka-dot number that Kate wore after giving birth to Prince George in 2013 is perhaps the most iconic Jenny Packham look of hers. It's one of the more casual designs by the label, which is more well-known for the stunning gowns Kate wears to official events. Jenny Packham Draped V-Neck Cold-Shoulder Dress, $292 SHOP SIMILAR Speaking of the stunning gowns that Kate wears to official events, here she is in a show-stopping Jenny Packham dress for a dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Kate accessorized the dress with giant diamond earrings and a baby bump—she was pregnant with Princess Charlotte at the time! Baublebar Crystal Collar Necklace, $68 SHOP SIMILAR Another fast-fashion brand Kate can't seem to get enough of is Zara. (Hi, same.) In December 2013, she wore this statement necklace by the Spanish retailer that only cost $35, and she owns several dresses that she wears on more casual occasions, like when she watched this polo game and Prince George threw an adorable temper tantrum. Tadashi Shoji Striped Lace Gown, $748  SHOP SIMILAR As the name suggests, it's a London-based brand, so it makes sense that the Duchess tends to wear it so often. Temperley London is known for its elegant silhouettes that still maintain a sense of fun with patterns and embroidery, like this black-and-white dress she wore while on a royal tour of India in 2016.  2750 Cotu Canvas Trainers, $70 SHOP NOW This classic shoe is a staple in Kate's closet, which is great news for you and me because Supergas are affordable. Kate is fond of the white pair known as the "2750 Cotu" in canvas. Here, she wore them while on a royal tour of Canada in 2016, before embarking on a ship in Victoria Harbour. 14k Gold 3 Diamond Earrings, $298 SHOP SIMILAR When it comes to jewelry, the Duchess of Sussex is a fan of delicate styles, like this pair of gold Adina Reyter earrings she wore along with a bright yellow Brandon Maxwell midi. They're slightly hard to see in this pic, but the earrings feature three diamonds in a triangle formation, which strikes a subtle yet unique note.  The Looker Frayed Ankle Skinny Jeans, $228 SHOP NOW Meghan wowed everyone with her chic, laid-back style at the September 2017 Invictus Games in Canada. This was basically the first time Meghan and Harry were photographed together out in public, so you can bet a lot of eyeballs saw this 'fit. The look included an oversized button-down by Misha Nonoo and a pair of medium-wash frayed MOTHER jeans, which sold out almost immediately. But good news! They're back in stock—so you, too, can channel royalty.  Blue Devore Velvet Long-Sleeve Dress, $785 SHOP NOW Kate has worn dresses by the Canadian and Turkish designer on several occasions, including in January when she was photographed in this gorgeous blue velvet number while pregnant with Prince Louis. She sported the midi dress, which featured bell sleeves and a high collar, on a royal visit to Sweden.  Everlane Italian GoWeave Classic Blazer, $135  SHOP SIMILAR Meghan loves a good pantsuit, as evidenced by this sophisticated Alexander McQueen set she wore in February 2018. Although she didn't wear a McQueen wedding gown, as many people speculated she would, the Duchess nevertheless seems to appreciate the fashion house's timeless aesthetic. Ellery Pallen Moire Mini Dress, $1,895 SHOP SIMILAR Alexander McQueen is also a favorite (or ~favourite,~ I should say) of Kate’s, who did wear a dress by the fashion house for her wedding. Kate also wore white McQueen for all of her children’s christening ceremonies (that's bb Louis over there) and has opted for the British designer's looks for other high-profile events, including Harry and Meghan’s wedding and Princess Eugenie’s wedding. Catbird Threadbare Ring, $44 SHOP NOW Meghan's penchant for delicate jewelry was apparent again during a visit to Scotland in February 2018, when she stacked numerous gold rings across her fingers. How pretty! See that simple gold band on her pointer finger? That 14K design was created by Brooklyn-based jewelry brand Catbird.  Tahari Double Face Wool-Blend Wrap Coat, $268 SHOP SIMILAR Like Kate, Meghan loves J.Crew, and she was spotted in this navy wrap coat with white contrast in March 2018. And yes, the coat, which retailed for $168, immediately sold out after her appearance.  Etsy Feather Fascinator, $44 SHOP SIMILAR The name Stephen Jones is synonymous with fancy hats. His designs were frequently worn by Princess Diana, and now Meghan is carrying the torch. Here, she wore a chic neutral hat to match her dress at her first post-wedding appearance for the Prince of Wales' 70th birthday.  Tory Burch Robinson Leather Tote, $348 SHOP SIMILAR The Spice-Girl-turned-designer was a guest at Kate's wedding (and Meghan's too!), so it makes sense that the Duchess is a fan of Beckham's fashion label. Here, she was spotted carrying a leather tote from the line while watching a polo game, pairing it with a Zara dress.  Roland Mouret Darley Midi Dress, $1,365 SHOP SIMILAR Meghan tapped the fashion house for her breathtaking wedding gown, and she's also leaned on the label for other looks. Case in point: this neutral sheath with a cape-like covering over her shoulders, which she wore to her first solo royal outing with the Queen.  Norma Kamali Diana One-Shoulder Ruched Dress, $215 SHOP NOW  Really, it can't be stressed enough how much Meghan loves Givenchy. Meg even made a surprise appearance at The Fashion Awards in London last year to present Clare Waight Keller, the artistic director of Givenchy who famously designed Meghan's wedding dress, with the award for British Womenswear Designer of the Year. Meghan obviously wore Givenchy for the event and looked absolutely stunning in a black gown. Maggie Marilyn Kindness Breeds Kindness Dress, $650 SHOP SIMILAR Meghan is friends with the designer, and there also was speculation he would make her wedding dress (but no, we already went over the fact that it was Givenchy, remember?!) The Duchess often wears Roland Mouret pieces on royal outings, such as this dove-grey bateau-neck dress during a visit to Ireland.

			 It goes up to size 26W!    Anthropologie has finally expanded its clothing to make it accessible for women above a size 16. On Friday, the brand launched APlus by Anthropologie, which features extended sizing from 16W to 26W. Previously, the retailer only reached women sizes 00P to 14P and 00 to 16. Personally, I am obsessed with Anthropologie and could not be more thrilled that the brand has finally taken this major step to reach real women of all sizes.   Much like its wellness shops, APlus by Anthropologie will have its own mini shops within select Anthro stores across the country, including in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Illinois, Texas, and California. “What to expect? A collection with all of the fun, charm, and romance of Anthropologie,” Hillary Super, co-president of Anthropologie, writes on the site’s landing page.  The extended sizing has more than 120 (!) styles from its new spring collection, which features models Candice Huffine, Paloma Elsesser, and Ali Tate in a beautiful campaign shot in Mexico City. And yes, it includes some of Anthro’s favorite in-house brands (read: Maeve and Pilcro), with support from other labels like DL1961 and Cloth + Stone.  Considering there are hundreds of styles to choose from, I narrowed down my favorites to shop for spring and summer, below.

			 Omg, this dryer-sheet trick is like magic?! Want more fashion hacks? We gotchu. Subscribe here! Clothes! We all wear ’em! But sometimes they can be the cause of major frustration when a thread snags, the fabric is pilled beyond belief, or your dress is just NOT staying in place. And more often than not, the specific tools to fix said problems are not handy when you’re out and on the go (or have zero cash). Enter these unsung fashion hacks from Reddit that cost basically nothing and feature more commonplace items that you can fit in your purse or stash at your desk. Trying to get in the last couple uses of your furry coat before it warms up, but it’s all matted and pilled and not cute? Gently take a back-comb brush to it to give it more life (i.e., make it fuzzier). This method also removes rough pilling so your coats and sweaters will look (almost) as good as new!  Take your matted down jacket... ...and pilled sweater...  ...and use this guy on 'em.  But also this de-piller isn't pricey either!   Sometimes you realize you don’t have a lint roller on you, and it’s always the moment you need it most. Of course. But another thing that’ll get all those lint fuzzies and hair off yourself is good old-fashioned packing tape.  One Reddit user swears by Scotch packing tape: “Much stickier than a lint brush and pulls everything off in one yank.” And I believe her. So if you’re ever in a pinch at the office before a big meeting, odds are, you can scrounge around for a roll and test drive this yourself. (And when you do find it, hoard it at your desk to keep it handy for future use.)  One second you’re wearing a heavy earring, and the next, it drops on the ground because the back slid off—and is forever lost. But you don’t have to go the whole day trying to confidently rock a single earring while pretending this was part of your lewk all along. Enter: a nifty pencil eraser that actually holds your studs and dangly accessories in your earlobe.    Posting this here for no other reason than I'll need it later for something. Pls carry on with your Friday night and remember to hydrate A post shared by  Mia Lardiere (@mialardiere) on Feb 22, 2019 at 5:10pm PST Stock up on erasers.  Snip away.   Keep extra earring backs on you! Hold your sh*t.   Constantly tugging at your dress because you’re in constant fear of a wardrobe malfunction is not fun. Neither is pulling up your socks that keep falling down, hence, no one can see how cute they actually are! While some items have silicone or rubber striping on the inside that’s supposed to hold them up, it doesn’t seem to work that well most of the time? So if you’ve tried every trick in the book, try this one last hack: Sticky. Gel.  “For strapless casual wear, I use a roll-on sticky gel that keeps my dress up and prevents the terrible look of lifting it with my hands,” one user wrote. They also recommended this body fixative so their no-show socks stay no-show. These wash off easily with water and won’t mark or stain your clothing, so your garment (whatever that may be) is held in place—and you don’t have to worry about accidentally flashing anyone. Amazing! Summer’s almost here and so is the time to wear all your white clothing! But if they’re looking a little dingy and you don’t want to drop some $$ on bleach, a not-so-quick but super-easy way to make them bright again is to leave them out in the sun. But the key is that they have to be WET.  One user suggests either hanging your whites in the sun or laying them flat and flipping them halfway through right after they come out of the wash.  (But also totally understand if you don’t have the time, so here’s a whitener you can throw in the wash!)  If the weave of the garment isn’t too tight, you can use this low-key genius method to save all your snagged tops.  But if the weave is tighter and won’t allow a bobby pin to pass through, from personal experience, you can also use the point of a safety pin to carefully push the rogue thread down to the inside of your clothing.  I mean, this video is like watching sorcery, but it works so well?! But keep in mind that this is purely for *fresh* deo marks, like a you-were-in-a-hurry-and-totally-missed-your-armpit kind of thing. Deodorant stains—as opposed to marks—require more TLC, like soaking them in white vinegar, applying baking soda, or putting them in water and hydrogen peroxide because buildup is a little harder to remove.

			 Get it, Kourt. It's my duty to inform you that Kourtney Kardashian went to a birthday party at an L.A. restaurant called The Six on Tuesday night wearing this outfit, which was part Matrix, part athleisure, and all abs. OMG:   Basically, Kourtney paired a black sports bra-like thing with a see-through Fendi midi skirt and layered a very Neo-esque leather trench over the whole get-up. Oh, she also had coordinating ankle booties on. She looked good, it has to be said. Let's do a close-up of this whole situation, shall we? Fierce. Kourtney's skirt most likely cost a pretty penny, so here are some other sheer skirts to try, if you're into that! $178 SHOP NOW $54 SHOP NOW $158 SHOP NOW $178 SHOP NOW $178 SHOP NOW $148 SHOP NOW Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

			 Start your week on the right foot (sorry). Just because everyone and their mother owns a pair of Adidas Stan Smith sneakers doesn’t mean you shouldn’t swap out your dirty ones for a fresh pair...especially when there’s an amazing sale happening.

			 Dream dress inspo right this way!  Of all the stunning dresses that have graced the red carpet at the Academy Awards, these 45 are the most—most gorgeous, most iconic, most timeless. Just the most.  Taraji was an absolute vision when she showed up in this Vera Wang gown featuring a major slit and keyhole cutout.  Dressed in a custom Chanel off-the-shoulder gown, Margot accessorized with a sparkly clutch to match the metallic details on her neckline.   Tiffany paid tribute to her father's heritage in a gorgeous Eritrean dress that had stunning gold accents and a bold pattern. She also wore a gold headpiece and jewelry to complement the ensemble.  Davis wore a stunning cold-shoulder gown by Armani, which she paired with a metallic bag and a pixie haircut. She won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in Fences.  Stone wore this '20s-inspired flapper dress with gold fringe by Valentino. She completed the Old Hollywood glamour look with retro waves in her lob-length hair.  Ronan wore a sequined emerald green Calvin Klein gown, accessorizing with matching emerald jewelry. The dress featured a plunging neckline and a super sexy back cutout.  Larson took home the Best Actress Oscar wearing this bright blue Gucci number for her performance in Room. The gown had pleated ruffles and a statement floral belt around the waist.  Jennifer Lopez wore a blush-colored dress with a huge tulle skirt by Elie Saab. She kept her hair pulled up so as not to distract from the gorgeous couture ballgown.   Witherspoon wore a black and white figure-hugging dress by Tom Ford and accessorized with diamond jewelry. The off-the-shoulder gown with its black accents was classic and *so* chic.  Pike wore a bright red Givenchy gown with lace details, a thigh-high leg slit, and a cinched waist.  Nyong'o truly had a Cinderella moment in this pale blue Prada dress and her beaded pearl headband. She took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress this year for her role in 12 Years a Slave.  Kate Hudson was incredibly sleek in a silver ruched Atelier Versace gown with a matching cape and silver clutch.  Chastain chose a coppery sequin mesh strapless column by Armani Prive. The gold color totally complemented her red curls.  Washington wore a pink Miu Miu dress with a floral bodice and bright red accessories.  Paltrow opted for a simple white Tom Ford dress with a matching floor-length cape. She kept her hair sleek and tucked behind her ears with an exaggerated side part.  Jolie wore a black strapless Atelier Versace dress with black peep-toe shoes – but she really made an effort to show off the thigh-high slit by popping her right leg out in every pose. Get it, Angie.  Kunis wore a stunning lilac Elie Saab dress with a scoop neckline and delicate lace. She styled her romantic ensemble with her hair pulled into a chic chignon.  Lawrence stunned in her Calvin Klein bright red-orange dress at her first time attending the Oscars. She kept her dress simple and let the bold color make the statement.  Saldana wore this purple ombre Givenchy dress with an embellished bodice and a thigh-high leg slit. She wore purple peep-toe heels to match the fabric of her dress.  Portman wore a pink strapless Rodarte dress with a flowing skirt and embellished bodice, accessorizing with a metallic clutch and a huge diamond bracelet. She kept her neck bare and her hair in an updo to emphasize the sweetheart neckline.  Cotillard was an absolute vision in this Great Gatsby-looking Jean-Paul Gaultier mermaid gown. It featured white scales and a plunging neckline, which she accentuated with long, delicate necklaces. The French actress won an Oscar for her role in La Vie En Rose.   Cruz chose a stunning blush-colored Atelier Versace ballgown with a pleated bodice and feathered skirt. She dressed up her ensemble with diamond jewelry, but perhaps her best accessory was the Oscar she won for her performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.  Willams lit up the red carpet in a canary-yellow Vera Wang dress and a bold lip. The dress featured a pleated neckline and a flowing train.

She was nominated this year for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Iris.  Roberts wore this iconic black and white Valentino column with a train when she won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brokovich. It was classic, elegant, and became one of the most memorable Oscar dresses in history.  Liu matched the red carpet in the best way with this one-shoulder sequin dress featuring various shades of red. She kept her hair sleek and straight, accessorizing with a diamond bracelet and matching heels.

			 I’m not even a teen, and I want all of these? If you thought finding gifts for teen boys was hard, you haven’t started shopping for that teenage girl on your list yet. Teenagers are notorious for not liking anything and returning everything, but we like a challenge, so we set out to find a ton of  gift ideas for teen girls that they’ll probably—no, definitely like. If you’re feeling stressed and need some pointers, scroll on for 40 unique, cute gift ideas even the pickiest teen girls would want, whether it’s for her birthday, the holidays, or you just feel like giving her somethin’ special. We bet you won’t even need the gift receipt.  This tool dries, styles, and brushes all in one pass. For the days when she wants to give herself a glam blowout, she’ll be pumped to have this hot-air brush on hand. She obsessed with beauty? Then she knows the perfect place to store nail polishes, lipsticks, serums, and creams is in the fridge. Since she likely still lives with her parents and has to share refrigerator space, she’ll appreciate having a tiny personal one for all of her fave products. Her room will look so trendy with a letter board she can switch up with punny, cute phrases. When it comes to owning comfy pairs of pajamas, the limit does not exist. Elevate her PJ game with a set she can wear to bed or when she’s just hanging around the house. Bonus: This waffle-knit long-sleeve shirt and shorts is perfect for any time of the year.  Glossier and Gen Z go together like peanut butter and jelly, so any product from the beauty brand would be a safe bet. Since she likely already has a bunch of their products, go with a new one she hasn’t tried yet, like this dewy facial serum. Did we mention it’s one of Cosmo’s beauty team’s favorite new products? I understand the irony of your teen girl wanting mom jeans, but trust. She wants them. These high-waisted wedgie Levi’s have a cropped length and relaxed fit that she’ll love.  If the girl loves astrology, and her monthly horoscope just isn’t enough, this guide book will help her navigate any relationship in her life, from family to friends. What are your teen years for if not for getting piercings to make your parents mad?! This super-cute dainty hoop is made of solid gold and small enough that maybe her parents won’t notice. Classic white sneakers go with everything, and these extra-cushiony and slightly platformed shoes will be her most comfortable pair yet. The harder the person to shop for, the more money you feel like you have spend. But with this set of 10 super-cute hair clips, you don’t have to drop a lot of cash to find a good gift. A good pic is ALL about the lighting, and the same goes for makeup application. This light-up vanity mirror features adjustable LED lights and phone attachments, which makes it equally perfect for doing makeup or filming TikTok videos.  You don’t need a record player to appreciate the gift of a vinyl record. She might already have every Billie Eilish song on her Spotify playlist, but this album is the collectible item she’ll have for years to come. She doesn’t have to be a VSCO girl to love reusable water bottles. This one helps your drinks stay the perfect temp and has a wider opening for easy cleaning. If you thought teen girls were too young to appreciate scrunchies, you thought very, very wrong. This pack of five comes with a mix of fabrics and colors to match any of her outfits or vibes.  Does she love all glittery things? Is she also into astrology? Make it easy on yourself and go with this astro-themed eyeshadow palette. With metallic, glittery, and multi-reflective textures in unique pink, purple, and turquoise shades, this is one Mercury retrograde she’ll actually love. Sherpa jackets aren’t going away anytime soon, so add to her collection with this hooded version in gray, camel, and off-white. Made with super-soft sherpa fleece, she’ll never want to take it off. Some phone cases look cool, but aren’t all that practical. This shock-proof floating glitter case strikes the perfect balance of both.  Let’s be honest—half the purpose of a candle is to smell good and the other is to look good. This beachy one with notes of woods, pink peppercorn, and tulip comes packaged in a pretty blue-glass vessel, and checks both of those boxes. Few boots are as classic and trendy all at once as Doc Martens. This gift is one teen girls will definitely wear more than once. A set of three gold rings will look so amazing stacked on her fingers. She can opt to wear all at once or simply pick one to best complement the rest of her ’fit. Is it big enough to fit her homework? Probably not, but that’s not the point of this stylish baby backpack. If she’s got an extensive bag collection, she’d love to add this to the lineup. A formula that actually lengthens without any clumping? Yes, please. It’ll make her lashes look like falsies without the pain of dealing with annoying glue. Also, if she’s more adventurous, this comes in multiple bright colors like cobalt and violet. Treat her to a pair of trendy hoops with pretty aqua-colored gemstones. Whether she has multiple piercings or just one, these will definitely add some sparkle to her lobes. She’ll be obsessed with lightweight drawstring shorts that’ll go with all her denim jackets and mules. A set of travel-size hair goodies (that also comes with a fun canvas bag) is a great gift if she’s always using products and heat tools on her locks. This includes shampoo, conditioner, a detangling primer, hair mist, and more. If she likes to stay organized and write everything down, a compact notebook with a gold spiral will be right up her alley. A balm that leaves her lips so smooth—and also happens to be available in eight other hues—is one she’ll use over and over again. If she wants her accessories to look a little more polished, then a leather-detailed crossbody will do just the trick. The cylindric silhouette and navy hue guarantee she can wear it with almost anything. A grown-up perfume is a great present, especially if she’s into notes like jasmine and rose. Plus, the glass bottle is hella chic. K-beauty devotees will love this jelly cleanser. It’s free of sulfates and parabens, while it effectively removes makeup and makes skin feel refreshed, clean, and moisturized. If she’s escaping the cold winter weather soon, get her an Insta-worthy vacation dress in the form of a striped midi. If she has a LOT of nostalgic photos lying around but no way to display them, get her a cute gold photo grid she can use to hang her pictures. Her room will be totally transformed and look so much more welcoming with the simple addition of firefly lights. She can weave them all around her room thanks to the flexible copper wiring. Her Spotify playlist will sound SO much better on a speaker. She can use it whether she is by herself and wants to listen to her jams out loud or she’s hosting friends for a get-together. Her outfit isn’t complete without a fresh mani. She’ll obsess over this stunning set of deep purples and blues that come in both solid and shimmery shades.  Succulents are such an easy way to be a plant owner without all the stress and hard work that’s so often involved in keeping other types of plants alive. And she’ll love to decorate her space with all 20(!!!) of these babies. Is she really into her beauty regimen? Then a cleansing brush that she can use with her fave face wash is totally for her. This product is tailored to different skin types and eliminates dead cells so she’s left glowing. If she’s always the person in her friend group who documents every party, sleepover, vacation, etc., then she’ll definitely put an instant-print camera to good use. Tortoiseshell is a classic pattern for sunglasses, but a pair that also has blue-tinted lenses, round frames, and gold accents puts a new twist on the style. If she has a penchant for gold jewelry she can layer, she’ll appreciate a delicate necklace with a vivid turquoise pendant.

			 It's from Target.  Sometimes, celebrities' fashion can be so fabulous, yet so unattainable. That's why it's such a treat when one of our favorite stars steps out in an affordable look. Selena Gomez did just that on Wednesday, when she was pictured in a friend's Instagram story wearing a $15 top.  In some super artsy shots with model, Connar Franklin, the two seemed to be exploring the great outdoors. They played with flowers, washed their face with river water, and stood there, enjoying nature. It seemed to be an ode to Selena's friend, photographer Petra Collins.    But, the exciting part comes in the last shot, which shows Selena wearing a baggy t-shirt with a silhouette of the state of California on it. Cut out of the silhouette is the shape of a bear.

			 Go, go, go!  Labor Day weekend might signal the end of summer for some, but Nordstrom is keeping the season alive with its 40 percent off summer sale. There's still amazing discounts happening, folks, and these 18 styles will give your closet a serious leg up when fall rolls around. Now, shop away!  You know you've always wanted a pair of these popular shoes, so why not treat yourself? The classic style goes with jeans, skirts, dresses, and, well, just about everything else.  In mind-blowing news, this silhouette resembles a structured blazer, but it's actually a soft cardigan. It even has fancy reverse-lining!  Achieving a great neutral lip has never been so inexpensive thanks to a lipstick and gloss duo you'll wear all the time. When the cold weather rolls around, your shoe closet is probably filled with blacks and browns, so snag a white-hot pair to really mix things up. Can't let go of summer just yet? Add a linen dress to your closet—you'll look so Parisian chic.  Camouflage is back and better than ever, and a boxy jacket in the pattern pairs amazingly well with any shade of denim.  Get yourself a pair of easy-to-slip-on jeans that are in between a straight and boyfriend fit—they'll feel looser than your usual skinnies, but you won't drown in them. Pumps with a little kitten heel are professional enough for the office but comfortable enough to wear everywhere else; plus, the tan shade pairs easily with other colors.  A twist on classic hoops, this pair features two hoops in different sizes and looks that much cooler.  The crossbody silhouette makes this bag casual, while the chic black and white stripes and gold accents really elevate it.  If you love a dramatic sleeve moment, look no further than a navy peplum top that's minimal in all other respects—that way, those shoulder details can *really* stand out.  Add this to your makeup arsenal stat: a gorgeous eyeshadow palette that channels the rich fall foliage hues. Whether you dress up a denim mini with heels or pair it with boots, the skirt's versatility speaks for itself.  You probably have more than enough blue denim in your closet, so step outside your comfort zone with army-green jeans that'll become your new go-to pair.  A jumpsuit with sandals is breezy for summer, but the dark pattern and belted waist make it sophisticated for fall.  You may already have a ton of gold chain necklaces, but you're probably missing a long pendant. Snag a minimal piece like this one, and layer it with your other jewelry to add bling to any outfit.  A mini backpack (that's also water-resistant!) is basically an essential for short weekend trips, coffee shops, or classes: It's the perfect size to fit all your things, but you won't feel weighed down.  When you think of fall fashion, cheetah print likely comes to mind, so stay on top of popular prints this season with a pair of trendy flats.

			 Alexei stans, wya?   Another season of Stranger Things has come and gone (but there’s a fourth season to look forward to, don’t worry!), but if you’re still not over all the sci-fi drama and Alexei’s obsession with Slurpees, you should definitely dress up like the characters this Halloween. You can totally look like the Hawkins resident you kinda wish you were with these costume ideas. (Emphasis on the “kinda,” because that town has seen some scary sh*t.)   Take your obsession for the show to the next level with any of these getups, OR you can always go in with your friends on an epic Stranger Things group costume. Also, you have tons of material to work with because the characters’ outfits and looks have all evolved from when we first saw them in the very first season—i.e., you can choose to go as Eleven in the pink dress and wig or badass Eleven with slicked hair, a smokey eye, and an all-black wardrobe. There are tons of options! Here, 12 ideas from all seasons of the show that you can shop right now.  Still not over her untimely death from season 1? Same. Turn into Barb with a plaid shirt, short red wig, glasses, and a take-no-sh*t- personality.    There’s no way you watched the show and didn’t develop a crush on Hawkins’ chief of police. Transform into your fave character with a fake mustache, sheriff’s uniform, and signature hat.    This one’s a classic. When the show first premiered in 2016, it was THE costume that year, but TBH, you still can’t go wrong with that pink dress (and a box of Eggo waffles).    Aka the coolest middle schooler, and arguably just person, in all of Hawkins. She can really rock a track jacket like no other. Plus, skating from house to house is a v efficient way to nab the most candy.     If you and a bunch of friends want to dress up like the characters in season 2, go with the fall vibes seen here with Lucas’s burgundy shirt, Mike’s knit sweater, and Max’s pullover. And basically everyone will know who you are if you wear that signature red, white, and blue hat.    TBT to your middle school dance days, and safe to say that my man Dustin totally killed it in this suit-and-shirt combo. Pro tip: Use the extra-hold hair gel to really give your hair some height.   Remember when Eleven met Eight (that sounds like a bad joke, but it’s not) and then got this angsty all-black makeover? It’s arguably one of the best scenes of season 2. Get with the goth vibes for Halloween by dressing up as the telekinetic teen—or get with a friend and go as a pair.    The oldest Wheeler kid loves herself a cardigan—and permed hair. You’ll resemble Nancy in this exact outfit, and make sure you curl your hair the night before to *really* pull it off.    The most iconic outfits in all of season 3 are these amazing sailor uniforms that Steve and Robin wore. Who knew Steve would even be willing to put a white hat over his gorgeous, carefully gelled locks?    The season 3 aesthetic is VERY different from the one before, mainly because of the seasons (duh). If you enjoy their summer lewks more, go with these key pieces from this ~ominous~ shot.    Everyone went crazy for this ’fit—it was part of Levi’s collab with the Netflix show, and while the exact pieces are sadly sold out on the brand’s site, they are available (with markups!) on StockX. Then mess up your hair a bit with a teasing comb and dab some fake blood around one nostril (a must), and you’re done!    Don’t want to be any of the kids? Be the monster that tries to kill them almost every day! This terrifying Demogorgon costume is available on Amazon if you actually want to scare the life out of everyone in your neighborhood. Enjoy!

			 Picks outfit number five, has a Friends marathon inside instead of going out. Classic us! Everyone knows Halloween is peak fun when you’re able to dress up with friends or as a group. Yeah, yeah, yeah: There are spooky costumes, pun costumes, and DIY costumes to choose from out there, but they’re just not as fun without your partner(s) in crime. Scroll on for some great costume ideas to try with your best friend(s), from Friends characters to the twins from The Shining and beyond.   They’re baaaaack. And they’re wearing matching bloodstained blue dresses and knee-high socks. Pick a color and live your  best mighty morphin’ life in bodysuits, tights, and matching boots. Plaid skirt, designer bags, pussy-bow blouses, and exactly one headband = classic Upper East Siders. Bros for life. Decide who gets to wear green, who gets to wear red, and then slap some overalls on top of the whole thing. Honestly, my kind of night.  Rollin’ with the homiesssss. Pick your fave character from the movie and then get into their ’90s style. Me want cookie! Also: Aren’t those fluffy headbands the cutest with these costumes? Honestly upset that I didn’t think of this costume idea first. And the dosage-cup headbands are so spot on. This one requires pretty amazing DIY skills—the dog face and slinky middle!!!—but man, it looks great when it’s done! Dontcha wanna? If you do, get ready to wear colorful latex outfits and white boots all night long! The costume is conflict-resolution skills + fast food. If y’all want to be hard-core for Halloween, get ready to rock in some all-black looks with the iconic face paint to match. Everyone’s favorite high schoolers and everyone’s favorite metallic, pastel minidresses! Don’t mean to be a pusher, but you should probs go for this costume if you have four BFFs. On Wednesdays, we wear pink! La la la la la la. This one’s pretty easy to DIY. Just find a green blazer and a red one, and line them with black seams. 👯 in costume form! Because your hearts break when you’re not together! Also because this costume can be worn with literally anything and just requires that you hold a piece of cardboard all night. Minimal effort for the win! If one of you likes to be spooky and the other isn’t as into that, be Cruella and a dalmatian puppy. The only thing missing? Boo, of course! Related: Onesie costumes are the best costumes. Underrated Nickelodeon show, IMO. Take a trip to Wonderland as some of this classic story’s most zany characters. If the Mad Hatter and the Hare just aren’t scary enough for you, go as super-creepy, kinda-dead versions of Alice and the White Rabbit. Doesn’t get better than calling your BFF “football head” all night. Just don’t tell these two how the show ends. Perfect your first-position stances, please! And also, get matching tutus and be ready with the white and black face paint for this one. Everyone’s favorite seasonings, ready for Halloween!

			 Free-spirited, bohemian vibes await you. Kate Hudson can add clothing designer to her resumé. The actress and entrepreneur has launched her first-ever ready-to-wear line, Happy x Nature (pronounced as happy by nature), which reflects her free-spirited West Coast style.  “It’s like if you write a script—you write what you know. So I [worked with Michele Manz] to design this line for myself,” Hudson told Marie Claire. “Authenticity is so important to me because I’m not going to stand behind something if I myself won’t wear it.” The eco-friendly fashion line is filled with effortless summer pieces, from an off-the-shoulder polka-dot dress to a floral jumpsuit to this top and skirt situation, which Hudson said is perfect for Coachella (or whichever summer music festival you’re off to).  “This top is made from recycled water bottles,” she told Marie Claire.  Hudson explained that recycled plastic bottles were crushed and then turned into a fiber that became this top as well as the jeans. She added that Happy x Nature doesn’t ship with plastic, and the brand’s packaging is all biodegradable (in 12 to 18 months)—even its tags are made from natural fibers. Despite being eco-friendly, the brand’s prices remain in an affordable $48 to $148 range.  This commitment to sustainability even ended up in the brand’s name, which Hudson’s partner, Danny Fujikawa, helped her come up with.  “I like happy, that word makes you feel good, but I wanted it to be about what the product was,” Hudson told MC. “I always knew we would lean toward a sustainable line and use things that were eco-friendly, so nature had to be a part of it too. So Danny just said, ‘Happy by nature. That’s what people think you are.’ Though, I don’t think anyone is happy by nature. I think it’s something we all work at, but I think we all want to make nature happy.” Hudson named a sunshine-yellow dress in the collection after her mom Goldie (Hawn), who wanted an easy dress to wear on vacation. “We like to call this entire collection statement casual because we want the clothes to feel like everyday wear but still catch other people’s eyes,” she said. (The strapless dress and the utilitarian denim pieces definitely caught my eyes.)

			 It comes just one week after Gucci got in trouble for a similar problem. Katy Perry and her eponymous shoe line, Katy Perry Collections, are taking heat for two designs that appear to resemble blackface. TMZ reports that the two styles, the "Rue Face Slip On Loafers" and "Ora Face Block Heel Sandals," are being pulled from stores due to the backlash.  @katyperry are you actually serious right now?! blackface on a SHOE?? what is WRONG with you pic.twitter.com/x3J6ZKPvxc "In order to be respectful and sensitive, the team is in the process of pulling the shoes," a source told the publication.  The loafers come in two colorways, neutral and black, and the high-heeled version in gold and black. Both designs feature blue eyes, a triangular nose, and bright red lips.    The controversy comes less than a week after Gucci pulled and apologized for a sweater featuring similar bright red lips.   How does this keep happening with supposedly 'luxury' brands? No-one at Gucci clocked the similarity between the racist imagery of their $890 blackface jumper and Prada's keychain - the latter of which was pulled from stores less than two months ago? Or do they just not care? pic.twitter.com/pNxTbuJeXV Ignorance is Never A fashion statement! Apology NOT accepted😡#blackface #Gucci #gucciblackface #prada #moncler #katyPerry pic.twitter.com/KDCnkzGlgA  Katy Perry herself has been accused of cultural appropriation in the past: She wore her hair in cornrows for the music video "This Is How We Do" and dressed like a geisha during a 2013 American Music Awards performance.  Cosmopolitan reached out to Katy Perry Collections and will update this post if they respond.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 How?!?!   I practically live in sneakers—especially living in a place like New York City where you have to walk in and out of subway stations, go up and down stairs, avoid weird liquids on the sidewalks, and just protect your feet from the general trash and dirt and rats on the streets. (NYC is SO glamorous.) So naturally, with all this information, it’s very hard to keep any shoes—let alone white ones—clean, shiny, and new. That is, until I got these Keds. Not just any Keds, mind you, but LEATHER Keds.  Yes, the brand’s iconic Champion sneaker does come in canvas, but the leather material really holds up, and more than a year later, they look pretty darn close to brand-new—i.e., they’re still bright white like some very clean teeth right after a dentist appointment.  Since the material is smooth, getting any marks off is relatively easy. Canvas is a woven fabric so there’s more opportunity for tiny particles to really get stuck in there, but with these babies, all you have to do is take a damp cloth and wipe off any marks...and that’s it. Really. For more stubborn stains and scuffs, a Magic Eraser will do the trick. Seriously, the upkeep is very minimal.  Also important to note is that the leather isn’t stiff. Quite the opposite, in fact—it is soft and flexible and won’t give you blisters. With more wear, it will crease a bit by the toe area (c’mon, they won’t stay in perfect condition forever!), but they’re durable and I know my current pair will last me a long time.  This style is the brand’s most iconic for many reasons: They have cushion, breathable lining, and a flexible sole—i.e., they’re ideal if you’re going to be on your feet all day, but they are also super cute and go with everything because of their minimal silhouette.  I’ve been wearing mine recently with a bunch of fun socks (like these polka-dot Ganni ones), and this pairing has become my go-to. And if you’re not crazy about the white hue, they’re also available in navy and black leather. They come in narrow, regular, wide, AND double-wide sizes.  They have almost 2,000 reviews on Amazon and a 4.4-star rating out of 5 if that means anything to you. Here, some notable comments from real customers:     If you’re looking for an everyday shoe that holds up, is easy to clean, and looks super cute, then just do yourself a favor and buy these already, k?

			 The delicate bracelet conveys a powerful message to the Queen.  Meghan Markle was spotted on Thursday last week wearing a stylish navy J. Crew coat (sorry, it's already sold out!), but it was her jewelry – specifically a new diamond bracelet with a cross – that really stood out. Reportedly, Markle was baptized into the Church of England on March 6 with just a few royal family members there to witness, including her fiancé Prince Harry. The baptism is considered a "significant nod" and symbolic gesture to her future grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, who is head of the church. In pictures, she wears this bracelet stacked with another silver one, from Canadian jeweler, Birks. People reports that the cross bracelet is a baptism gift – a keepsake to remember the special day that often includes a cross or biblical reference – although who gave it to her remains unknown. Either way, this thoughtful (and stunning!) piece of jewelry is an elegant way to pay homage to the Queen, and Markle is really proving that she's fit to be a royal.  Basically, if it were up to me, her wedding to Prince Harry would be tomorrow, because she's so classy and sophisticated, and I just want to see her dress already!

			 These girls are literal 🔥.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Cosmo brought six of Instagram’s flyest dancers together on a helipad in L.A. to model the best of spring fashion and they were SERV👏ING👏 LEWKS👏. We also asked the amazing Kaelynn “KK” Harris (@KaelynnHarris) to cook up some brand-new choreography just for our shoot, and naturally, she killed that too. If you’re not already following Jade Chynoweth (@JadeBug98), Tessa Brooks (@TessaBrooks), Aliya Janell (@TheAliyaJanell), Delaney Glazer (@DeeGlazer), and Olivia Wong (@OliviaWong21), you need to, like, rn. These girls are seriously kicking ass, and they’re totally transforming the dance world. Dancers used to have to vie for spots on music tours and awards show performances, but nowadays, they’re not staying in the background. Nope, the new generation is putting themselves on display, right there on your phone screen, and it’s seriously paying off.  “Now that we have social media, it has blessed us to relate to people,” Kaelynn says. “They just feel closer to you....They know that ‘if she can do it, I can do it’ because it’s more of a normal thing. Because we’re not on the big screen—it’s just a little screen, you know?” Even if you don’t know these dancers by name, you’ve probably seen their faces before—their videos go viral All. The. Time. Millions of people are mesmerized by these IG stars’ insane moves, and after watching this video, you will be too. The choreo is legit hypnotizing! Oh, and by the way—that catchy tune you’re hearing in the background? That’s Olivia O’Brien’s new single, “Just a Boy,” which is so new it’s not even out yet! But we already have it on repeat, and we have a feeling you will too. If you can’t get enough of these 🔥 dancers, check out the May issue of Cosmo and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

With fresh ingredients delivered, you can whip up mimosas, a citrus salad, bacon and gruyere strata, and mouth-watering cinnamon rolls before she wakes up.   *Price reflected is per serving.  She can organize all her jewelry and display it in a gold box with convenient dividers.  A leather bag that lays flat but still fits all the necessities will be mom's favorite accessory. She doesn't even need to bring a wallet thanks to this design's interior card slots.  Your mom is a busy lady, so give her the gift of a best-selling, time-saving hair tool—i.e., this hair dryer slash brush that dries and styles her locks at once.  If she loves to stack on the rings, a set of three gold bands that she can wear on one finger or separate ones is a great present to splurge on.  She can finally relax and take some time to herself with these citrus-smelling bath salts that'll make her feel refreshed in no time.  A glass bowl with a colorful stand makes a beautiful display for fruits, pastries, and really any other food. It'll definitely be a focal point in her kitchen that she'll want to show off.  Yes, the tinge of pink and the brown gradient lenses are pretty, but she'll also appreciate that these are scratch-resistant and block all UVA and UVB rays.  If she's constantly on her feet, a pair of wool sneakers that bounce with every step is the perfect gift.  If your mom is anything like mine, she likes to go for a neutral eye look with Champagne, cream, coppery, and pink shades. This set also includes darker and metallic hues if she wants to go for more drama.  A comfortable cotton and linen sweater in a gorgeous light blue shade pairs perfectly with jeans or with dressier pants.  Sometimes the simpler the gift, the better. Case in point: a beautiful Swarovski crystal necklace she can layer or wear on its own. Whether she is tech-savvy or simply hates untangling wires (feel ya, Mom), she'll be obsessed with a pair of wireless headphones she can wear on the go. Has she been looking for an excuse to spruce up the house? A hanging planter is a simple way to add greenery to any space, and it also doubles as a decorative piece.  If her ideal weekend morning consists of drinking coffee and reading in her pj's, she needs this luxurious robe in her life to feel even more cozy.  She can match this slim watch with practically any outfit, thanks to the interchangeable rings in various colors. KitchenAid's mixers are popular for a reason: The 10-speed setting, multiple head attachments, and durable stainless-steel bowl make it a useful, long-lasting gift she'll rely on when baking.  She doesn't go anywhere without her purse (same), so you might as well get her one that holds up with a lot of wear. Longchamp's nylon totes come in an array of colors and have sturdy leather handles that can handle the weight of all her things.  Mom will feel so sophisticated when she spritzes on this iconic scent, whose musky yet floral fragrance transitions perfectly from day to night.  She loves an excuse to host a get-together, so a large platter will make her party planning that much easier. Any kind of food will look gorgeous when it's sitting on this aqua and teal plate.  She'll feel so relaxed with the scent of sandalwood and rose floating through the air. This size has up to 25 glorious hours of burn time.  She won't be able to contain her excitement when she can finally swap out her old wallet in exchange for a pretty pebbled leather one. This one has multiple dividers and pouches for coins, bills, and cards so she can stay organized.  A diffuser will make her bedroom room feel spa-like; plus, this white ceramic option is simple enough to complement any color scheme. Just 10 to 20 drops of oil are needed, and this baby will diffuse smells for up to 540 square feet.  A below-the-knee wrap dress works both for weekends and weekdays and strikes the perfect balance of casual and stylish. If she insists she doesn't need a gift, the least you could do is send mom a handpicked arrangement with a sweet note. Simple yet sentimental.  Can't decide on just one thing for Mom? Choose a gift box with a little bit of everything, like a scarf, soothing bath salts, a candle, a sheet mask, and perhaps most importantly, chocolate.  Her face will feel rejuvenated and fresh thanks to a fancy three-piece beauty set that includes a lightweight moisturizer, hydrating hyaluronic serum, and eye masks with 24k gold.  Who knew a French press could look so sophisticated? She'll get so much use out of this one, which is made from enameled stone and can whip up hot coffee or an espresso or cappuccino. The smooth glazed interior also makes cleanup super easy.   If she's a fashionista, a top with trendy ruffled sleeves and navy flower print will become her favorite shirt to wear.

			 Wear a different pair every day!  Bored of your usual go-to sunnies and want to switch up your summer style? From majorly oversize designs to teeny-tiny shapes and everything in between, check out these 20 different types of shades that’ll make your sunglasses collection the envy of all your friends.  Shield sunglasses are a lifesaver during the summer. Why? The frames surround the entire eye area and offer more coverage from the bright rays—BUT they can also take up almost half your face. Experiment with this shape in black with minimal details because a bright color or embellishments might look a bit overpowering. The marbled pattern goes with basically anything because it has various neutral black and brown shades. If you’re looking for an everyday pair, this one is a great go-to. Heart-shaped eyes aren’t just for emojis. Your sunglasses will look so playful and fun with these frames, and they’re definitely a different look from other, more traditional designs out there. Thanks to their metal accents and flip-up lenses, these frames have a cool retro vibe. And they’re really the best of both worlds: Flip them down when you’re outside and up when you’re indoors. Some clips are even sold separately so they attach to your prescription glasses. Love yourself a pair of sunnies that doubles as a mirror to apply lipstick? These eye-catching pink-and-blue ones will do the job. These kinds of lenses are also pretty opaque, so no one will see where you’re looking. If sunglasses are more than a pretty accessory for you, you’ll want to get a polarized pair. They block out harsh light, protect from bright glares, minimize eyestrain, and provide more clarity, among other features. Go extra (feline, that is) and opt for updated cat-eye sunnies with tiger stripes. The shape is designed with higher peaks and exaggerated angles to give you the ultimate street-style moment. Who doesn’t want to see life through rose-colored glasses, literally?  The pretty tint works with every skin tone and adds just the right  amount of color to any look without going overboard. The soft gold rim brightens your face and is super light to wear all day. Clear sunglasses are the best because they go with everything. The transparent frames blend in with your face, and the blue-colored lenses here reduce glare, offer 100 percent UV protection, and lessen eye stress. Channel your inner ’70s disco queen and style these round ones with your OTT festival attire—or really any other outfit because this shape is one that never goes out of style. Everyone needs a pair of white sunnies in their stash. It instantly ups the cool factor of even the simplest outfit, like a crisp white T-shirt and Levi’s jeans. Love that sporty sunglasses trend but not sure which one to try?  Westward Leaning’s pink Volt style with a gold brow is softer in color and angles so it doesn’t look like you’re up for a beach volley tournament anytime soon.  Plus, they are super light and rest well on your face. No, they’re not just for police officers. The less severe D-shaped lenses make this pair more wearable, and the saturated bottle green hue feels fresh. An added bonus: The delicate gold rim lends just the right amount of bling. Teeny-tiny sunglasses are here to stay, folks. The small styles vary in shape but instantly add edge to any look, like this version with its slight flattop and triangular bottoms. Wear it low on your nose bridge for that street-style vibe. The ’80s are back!!! JK, the decade never actually left. Case in point: these black Versace sunnies with tiny gold studs. Picking out embellished frames is a fail-proof stylish option without looking like you’re trying too hard. For those who feel that round or square lenses are too harsh for your face shape, try hexagonal styles. They tend to be less extreme and work with most face angles. This subtle yellow pair is a nice neutral piece to style with any outfit. Add a little drama to your everyday with oversize, black sunglasses. They’re great for blocking out UV rays (and any shade thrown your way). Rectangular sunnies work well for those with a high nose bridge, and a bold blood-orange color adds extra oomph. No other accessories needed, TBH. Slightly oversize with rounded edges, these sunnies have that old-Hollywood look. It’s an appealing style because they’re flattering for almost all faces. Not into the shield sunnies or the tiny frames but still want a pair that grabs attention? These cow-print ones from Poppy Lissiman are the answer.

Pair it with slouchy leather boots and a cozy cardigan (February is technically winter ppl!) and you'll turn heads.  A slinky slip just screams romance, and if you're headed to a fancy date night it's an easy piece to throw on that looks absolutely killer. Dress it up even further with a sparkly purse and strappy black heels.   Love yourself a coordinating crop top and mini skirt? Match your outfit even more by throwing on an equally red jacket, and then made it edgy with a pair of combat boots and black shades.  If you love that '80s fashion is making a comeback, then you'll also love this leather-looking dress that has amazing puff sleeves at the shoulder. Slide your legs into a pair of fishnets and finish the look off with block heels to dress it up.  Wear a pair of sky-high black heels with a floral print jumpsuit and you'll definitely stand out from the crowd. Sure, it might have a high neck in the front, but once you turn around it shows off some skin in the back.   There's nothing that says "It's Valentine's Day!" more than wearing pink on pink on pink.  Sport multiple shades of the hue with a chic coat, a slightly oversized sweater, a round crossbody, and blush heels to really go all out.   If you like making sure your outfit matches (but don't want to wear all of the same shade), opt for a bright long-sleeve top with matching heeled boots, and then put on polka-dot pants that have a hint of red.

Wear it with dark-wash jeans, white boots, and a matching bag ensure all the attention is on your bright red top.  If you're team cold shoulder 'til you die, look no further than this pink dress with breezy sleeves and a cute red lip print. Opt for beige heels and a bold bag to pull the whole ensemble together.  Don't want to go overboard on the V-Day theme, but still want to channel some romantic vibes? A leopard print shirt is just the right amount of sexy when paired with more subdued black jeans, brown boots, and a gold-accented crossbody.  A classic khaki trench coat is perfect for the spring weather, and when worn with a red long-sleeve sweater, matching pants, and cute ballet flats, it totally fits the V-Day mood.

			 Never changing out of this, BTW.  A couple months ago, I noticed that a bunch of celebrities were gravitating toward a very old-school trend. J.Lo, Zara Larsson, and even Matthew McConaughey had all worn floor-grazing, luxury dressing gowns with feather and marabou accents as part of their performances in movies, in music videos, or onstage. Please, take it all in:   But why should celebrities get to have all the fun in these over-the-top glamour gowns, vaguely reminiscent of the ’20s and ’70s? Jealousy isn’t pretty, except in this one instance where, out of extreme envy, I pitched a story in which I wear some of these robes myself, and, you guys, they’re even better in real life.  Having and wearing these luxe lounge items around the office taught me two important things about myself and humanity at large. Both gowns I wore were by designer Catherine D’Lish, who operates a luxury boudoir clothing business out of a small island off the coast of Washington state. Not only did her designs look lavish, but they also felt incredibly soft.  It’s not difficult to understand why the women of these bygone decades ambled around their houses in these gorgeous garments. It’s actually harder to get why this era of loungewear ever ended?? Thank god we’re bringing them back now. Let’s all do our part to keep them around.   It’s not just me! Ev-er-y-one wants in on these things. When I got them in and unpacked them, my colleagues were like, “Wait, what are those?” and “OMG, they’re everything. I neeeeed.” Multiple people wanted to take photos in them too. Thus, I came to another conclusion: We actually all need to buy them right TF now. But before we all wear them, there are a few details to understand: Best answer: wherever TF you want. But also, the best time to wear one is in the evening, as you’re getting ready for your night out. Preferably, you also have a glass of champagne in hand.  These distinctions are important to know if you’re going to start participating in this exciting robe renaissance. A housecoat is a long, loose, lightweight, informal garment you can wear inside. When I think of these, I envision the ones from the ’50s that had fun patterns and tied at the neck. A dressing gown is very similar, only it ties at the waist and is specifically worn either right after one gets out of bed or has taken a bath/shower. Dressing gown is also a term used much more frequently in the UK. A bathrobe is similar to a dressing gown, although it is typically made of terry cloth or another kind of water-absorbing fabric. Also, in case you’re wondering now that you’re here, the plain ole robe word can be used to describe any and all of these iterations. Cool! Anyway, so...you down to shop for some with me? Here we go. These silky, satiny wraps are perfect for your next party pre-game session. Some could even be worn ~as a dress~ for a particularly opulent night out. I’m a fan of these styles in pastel colors, but traditional lingerie shades like red, white, and black can be very pretty too. These robes are perfect to wear over slip dresses and silky PJs—or a great set of lingerie if you’re spending the night in with someone special.  Many of these luxe styles come with hefty price tags. If you’re not sure you can float the cash but still want the amazing experience of wearing one of these on a nightly basis—or just for the ’gram—consider some of the options here. If you’re just a short-robe kinda person at heart and you’re not sure what’s going on with all that extra fabric, you can still get in on the action. These feather- and marabou-trimmed pieces are still fun, even if they’re a bit less dramatic.

			 Cosmo staffers sacrificed their sensitive boob skin for the universal benefit of womankind. 
  Sticky bras are basically a necessary evil: painful to take off, not friendly to sensitive skin, and sometimes make your ’fit look worse than if you just went braless. That said, if you want to wear stuff with cool necklines but don’t want your nips to pop out or your chest to feel totally unsupported in thin or semi-sheer fabric, things your boobs have to get sticky. Wardrobe malfunctions are le worst, which means we’re forever in search of the perfect sticky bra. With so many options out there—and such varied results depending on boob size—12 Cosmo staffers sacrificed their nips at the adhesive altar of the highest-rated stickies on Amazon and Nordstrom so you don’t have to. Scroll on to find out what they thought. 
  A note on our review process and parameters: Cosmo employees self-identified their chest sizes (small = A and B cups; medium = B, C, and smaller D cups; and large = larger D cups and higher). Then they each tried on around four sticky bras, wearing them for a full night’s or day’s worth of activities unless they were too complicated to figure out, caused skin irritation, or fell off. If styles were re-wearable, they’d do a day-two retest on the power of the adhesive.  Nipple Covers Bunny-Shaped Lifters Silicone Lifters Petal-Shaped Lifters Cleavage-Boosting Lifters Wing-Shaped Cleavage Booster Circle-Shaped Cleavage Booster Underwire Bra With Sticky Tabs Plunge Bra With Sticky Tabs Drawstring Cleavage Booster 
  You’ve probably tried nipple covers before, but these ones are backed by more than 2,000 stellar reviews on Amazon and have a smooth, silicone feel. They come in three different matte skin tones in a finish that doesn’t reflect light (unlike the fabric petals you often see out there), so you don’t have to worry about the flash from that group dinner pic accidentally highlighting your choice of ~underthing~.  Because they’re basically pasties, you can pretty much wear them with any type of complicated outfit, from totally sheer styles to strapless, low-cut, and backless ones. See what our reviewers had to say below! SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "These are my favorite little guys ever. I wore them under a bodysuit to get a haircut (where the AC was BROKEN!) and then to a friend's place for drinks, and thennnnn to karaoke. These lasted the entire 80+-degree day, from 1 pm, to 1 am and they didn't even need to be pressed back on. I basically forgot I was wearing them. I have A cups, so the smallest size almost covered my entire boob, which was actually really nice because it rounded them out. These are definitely my new go-tos for any dress or top with a deep V. I've worn them at least three times (without washing them because I'm a monster) and they still stick." —Ashley, 32AA MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "These were totally lovely nipple covers that feel like actual fabric. They come super highly-rated on Amazon (79 percent five-star reviews!). I wore them with a maxi dress that has built-in underwire and was super pumped about the look (support from boning + nipple covers = A+). I could barely feel 'em at the end of the night, and they came right off without leaving my chest red or irritated. If you're not looking for support and you just want to cover your nipples, this is definitely the way to go." —Jessica, 34D LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "These were my favorite of all the sticky bras I tried. I really like that they came in two sizes in case you wanted more or less coverage on any given day. I like to wear these under tops I would normally not wear a bra with, to avoid a nip-slip. When I've tried other nip covers, they've folded or fallen off, but I didn't have any problems with these. I'd definitely buy these again because they're reliable and affordable (especially given how many wears you get per pair)! —Shannon, 36D 
  Awww, aren’t these sweet? Guessing these lil rabbit-shaped guys have blessed your Instagram feed with their adorable design and their promise of gravity-defying “ear” tabs. In case you’re like, Huh, but why? here’s the thought behind ’em: Stick the circle portion on your nipple and use the ears to lift your boob a little, then stick them flat, closer to your collarbone.  Because their lift process requires sticking so close to the clavicle, they’re not great for strapless pieces. Instead, use them with deep-V designs or something backless with plenty of coverage in the front. Bonus: If you don’t need the sag prevention, you could theoretically cut off the upper tabs and just wear them as nipple covers.  SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "These were confusing and I didn't know at first if the 'bunny ears' were supposed to go to the side, or up. Eventually I figured out they were supposed to go upwards, to lift the chest a bit. I guess I like where the idea of these are going, but this particular version seems to have some design flaws. It is not sticky along the edge, so it shows the silhouette of the thing through your shirt, and it comes up along the seam throughout the day. I wore this out with a blazer and no shirt and I'd say that's the only combo I'd ever try it with because you'd want a thicker material to hide the shape." —Katie, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "I did not like the texture on these. They didn't stick well on my boobs and I didn't trust them enough to actually leave the house with them on. I felt if I lifted my arms up over my head, they would fall off. Didn't wear!" —Taylor, 36B LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "I attempted to wear these to work, but they were like oversized pasties that did not form to boob shape. The edges all the way around did not lay flat. I only wore them for about two minutes. As soon as I started putting the second one on, the elongated strip up near my collarbone on the first one started peeling off. The stick didn't have enough stick. Thumbs down for me." —Kara, 34D  
  Like the bunnies above, these also cover nips and lift the breasts—and they do it a bit better, according to Cosmo staffers. They reported that these teardrop-esque adhesives really helped give them a nice shape in plunging styles, like blazers worn without tops underneath. They’re relatively see-through, but calling them ~invisible~ is a stretch for anyone with a darker skin tone, for whom these would absolutely show up as lighter than the rest of the chest. Last thing: These also only come in one size fits all, so if you have significant cups, these may not work as well. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "These are nice! I like that the upward tabs give me a little extra lift. The one downside is that it doesn't really work with strapless necklines, because the top tabs would show, but it stayed in place for hours. I re-wore it a couple times and it was easy to wash and maintained its stickiness nicely." —Katie, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "This puppy is a one-size-fits-all situation, which isn't necessarily amazing if you've got a full C or larger cups (ahem, hi). Sure, it was sorta comfy (as in, I wore it with a linen dress and after an hour, didn't think much about it), but lift, it did not. If you're naturally perky this would be an ideal option, but if you're looking for a lot of lift, not sure about these guys." —Jessica, 34D LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "This was the first sticky bra I tested out and I am OBSESSED with it. I've never actually successfully worn a sticky bra before (I have tried plenty) and I wore this out to a party and it stayed on all night, even though it was a million degrees outside. It fit really well and comfortably, and didn't make my boobs feel even heavier. It stayed VERY sticky. Like, to the point that I didn't even know how to store it because it just sticks to everything immediately. Still stayed sticky after a wash, too! Gonna wear this forevs." —Hannah, 32DDD  
  Why are so many sticky bras petal-shaped? Ain’t nothing natural about flower-outlined nipples, but I digress. This design has been reviewed by more than 300 Amazon users and has a solid 4-star rating. They have a definite pink color to them, so don’t expect that to blend in with the rest of the skin on your mammaries.  These work well with anything that isn’t sheer or strapless, due to that blush shade and tab situation. So, stick with backless pieces and low-cut necklines for this one unless you want to cut off the tabs. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "These were my favorite! I liked the clear top that could be cut off depending on your neckline. These had great coverage and stayed in place all day long. They were also easy to wash and rewear." —Katie, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "This one was good, gave a great shape to my boobs and I felt free, almost like I wasn't wearing anything! After a couple of hours though, it did start to feel like it was peeling off on the bottom, which made me keep touching my boobs hoping they'd re-stick. I washed and tried again the next day and the glue seemed just as sticky, but I decided not to wear them because I didn't want to be touching my boobs all day long. I'd say these are great for a special event where you'd only be wearing them for a few hours." —Liesl, 32C LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "I did not wear these out of the house. They're pretty thick and just made it look like I had insane, floral nipples. Maybe if I wore them with a thicker top or something padded it would make more sense, but...I will never unsee how weird my nipples looked through the dress I tried to wear these with." —Hannah, 32DDD  
  Alrighty. You want cleave and lift? These triangular pasties with another clear tab claim they can do it for you. Stick the nip-cover part onto your areolae, then lift your breasts using the tabs, like the ones above. Once they’re symmetrical and in place, you’ll hook a secondary clasp thing to each separate adhesive cup in the center. Sound complicated? It kinda is! A few Cosmo editors had trouble sorting this one out. Worn with the clasp and tabs, this is better for a plunging—but not too plunging—top or dress or something with a low back. The clasp part comes separately, so you don’t have to take your girls to Cleave Town if you don’t want to or if you were hoping to wear something more down-to-there. When we first picked this style to review, it had a solid 4 stars, but after our trial period, that number’s gone down to 3.3 out of 5 stars. That’s pretty much where our editors landed too. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "Immediately, this bra was a little confusing, as it came with some hooks that I wasn't entirely sure what to do with. Instead, I just wore it nipple-pasty style under a fairly loose, but low-cut romper. the night in question was a show I was performing in, which meant a fifteen minute walk with heavy equipment and then a performance under hot lights. I began sweating and felt the bra coming loose. It did technically stay on all night, but I didn't feel particularly supported or comfortable. After washing, the glue's integrity was a little worn down, but I wouldn't have worn it again anyway." —Natasha, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "Oh, man. This bra...is not a bra. It is a puzzle. One I thought I solved, only to learn halfway through wearing it that I deeply, deeply did not. Let me explain: I brought this to the beach, where I intended to wear it with a backless cotton sundress, but when I pulled it out of the packaging and tried to put it on, I couldn't. It comes with no instructions, a removable clasp that connects the cups, and two freaky flappy plastic tabs that can either go...up? Down? Out to the side? A mystery. It seemed like the flaps were intended to go up, but when I wore them that way you could visibly see thick random plastic that looked like huge clear band-aids. I adjusted the flaps to then stick around my sides, which was uncomfortable, but with the clasped cups, my cleavage was gorge. All was fine for about two hours, until midway through a rowdy dinner I heard a pop, looked down and saw the clasp had pulled apart, taking the adhesive hook from one cup with it. So..it broke. When I later looked at the listing online, I learned the flaps were indeed intended to go up, so you can really only wear with halter, or deep V situation. Hard pass for me." —Jessica, 34D LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "Okay, trying on this bra made me feel like there's a conspiracy that sticky bras just aren't for me. IDK what about my boobs makes them so not about adhesive designs. I was fully committed to wearing this bra out to dinner and a party one night because I was going to wear a strapless dress that had a deep V neckline, but the tabs you're supposed to use on this bra were literally so freaking long, I didn't see how you could wear it with anything but a crew-neck T-shirt. I'm not even exaggerating when I say the strips went up to my collarbone. Plus, while I was getting ready, I think the humidity or maybe my body temp or something caused it to peel off—I would have been pissed if that had happened when I was already outside the house." —Shannon, 36D  
  Um, 752 customers on Amazon have reviewed this bra, and 78 percent of them gave it 5 stars. With ratings like that, it was easy to get excited about this wing-shaped adhesive bra. That goes on semi-vertical. And then clasps together to create cleavage.  With no crazy tabs sticking up toward the collarbone, this bra can easily be worn with most necklines, including sweethearts, strapless, backless, and some plunges (not too deep, though, or you’ll see the closure in the center). SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "As a small-chested gal, I was immediately drawn to this bra because of its push-up claims—even if I was highly skeptical. The instructions were a touch unclear, as there was a 'pull' step that I'm not entirely sure I nailed. Basically, I just stuck on the cup to each boob and then clipped it together at the front. I was shocked by the results: Finally I had a perfect line of cleavage! I wore the bra under a summer dress for work, and if anything, felt my breasts might be a tad showy for the occasion. Admittedly, the bra isn't the most comfortable, as it did feel a little like i was physically holding my boobs together. Still, it held up all day and I decided these breasts couldn't possibly be contained to the night of Netflix I had in store, so I hit up a bar. I ended up re-wearing the bra on another occasion and found the quality to be same. This is definitely the best bra I've used for creating cleavage, non-stick or otherwise." —Natasha, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "This bra did a great job of creating cleavage and covering nipples, which is great, but I did feel as if the edges of it puckered a bit more than I wanted it to and if you wore it under a thinner fabric, that would show. It lasted the whole night, but did start coming up at the edge after a bit of sweating. I think other bras are better." —Rachel, 36B LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "I liked this one! For not having very long strips at the top, I really felt like these lifted me up and held me in place pretty well. They laid flat against my chest and had a nice cup shape to them. I only have one complaint: Because the nipple covering was already placed inside the cups, you didn't have much choice of where you put them, which is both good and bad. I may have needed a larger size—I couldn't get them to clasp together with that placement. I ended up just wearing them to dinner unclasped and still liked them! They lasted the whole dinner long. In the future, I'll probably use my own nipple cover and move them over, or just cut off the clasp and wear as is." —Kara, 34D  
  Similar in shape and vibe to the winged contraption above, this minimal sticky bra has a rounded shape and center closure that is supposed to create that cleave. Cosmo staffers enjoyed that this one didn’t have any gimmicks, like laces or tabs, to it—it was easy to slap it on and it stayed right where they put it all day long. It works well for strapless, slight plunge, and backless designs, but I wouldn’t go full J.Lo’s green dress with this on. One reviewer noted she may have needed a larger-than-usual size, so keep that in mind. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "The Nubra is different from your standard nipple-cover adhesive in that it promises to boost your cleavage. You're given two individual cups with clasps in the center and once you apply them to your breasts, you pull the two cups together towards each other and fasten the clasps to create ~boob shape~. This cleavage-enhancing bra was not as sticky as others, but this was fine by me (at first) since it took me a few tries to get the cups well-aligned. After they were set on my chest, the cups didn't feel very secure even though they fit my breasts well. I was at work and didn't want to suffer a wardrobe malfunction, so I checked on them periodically to make sure everything was kosher. About eight hours into wearing the bra, I entered a scenario I didn't anticipate: my nips started to itch like hell during a meeting. Inconspicuously patting them or rubbing them with my forearm did NOT help. I was trapped and there was nothing to do but pray. When that subsided, the Nubra clung to the chest for the rest of the day and they weren't too painful to remove. I wore them a second time after I gently washed and dried them and they grew on me. I experimented with a little more cleavage, and it totally worked. This bra was def my sleeper favorite." —Mia, 34A MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "These were...interesting. Easy to put on, but the cup size didn't seem to fit me correctly, and for this reason, I didn't wear them for long. They went out to dinner and drinks with my girlfriends on a Saturday night and the adhesive stuck to my chest and stomach well. The bra kind of protruded outward, so it probably wouldn't work for anything skin tight. When I washed and tested again, the adhesive lasted a long time." —Taylor, 36B LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "This bra combined everything I want in a sticky bra. No gimmicky ties and no crazy long tabs that make me want to cover up with a turtleneck. I like how this one had full coverage cups and managed to stay on throughout the day while I wore a regular tank. This is an old faithful." —Shannon, 36D  
  Okay—this bra is really different from the other options in this list so far. The front of the bra has no adhesiveness, because the stick is all in the clear side tabs. You can also swap out these tabs for clear straps if you’d rather! Because the tabs on the side can reach pretty far back to counterbalance the nonsticky action in the front, this bra isn’t great for backless styles but works well for strapless pieces, spaghetti straps, and slightly low-cut necklines. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "I liked this one, but it takes some getting used to after the other all-over-sticky bras that I tried, because it is only adhesive on the sides. For this reason, I kept feeling like it was falling off, but it actually wasn't! I didn't love that feeling, so I think I'll stick with the other types of bras out there." —Katie, 34B MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "I went to work in this one wearing a backless summer dress that I'd typically wear without a bra so I could take it off in case it didn't work. Glad I did this because it fell off on my walk to the job! Probably important to mention I have a 20 minute commute. When I got to the office, I took it off and didn't know where to put it so I stuck it to the underside of my desk. It did stay there all day, but I probably would only wear this one with the clear straps it also comes with, not with the adhesive sides." —Liesl, 32C LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "Although the sticky sides of this held in place throughout an entire lunch out with friends, it didn't do a whole lot of supporting. Part of it may have been me not putting the side straps up quite high enough? Regardless, though, the top part of this bra tips away from the body and therefore doesn't do much in terms of support. This also makes the top edge poke in a line through my shirt. I initially liked that this bra didn't have sticky cups, but it didn't help in the end."—Kara, 34D  
  This bra is similar in theory to the one above, but it is sticky All. Over. Including inside the cups and all along the sides. It’s padded, so it gives your chest some real oomph, and it has a dramatic plunge, so it works with more low-cut styles than other cleavage-boosting options do. The side tabs mean it’s not great for anything low-backed or backless, but any other complicated neckline situation should work well! Just so you know: This worked well for medium- and small-chested reviewers, but D cups and above were like, “Nah.” SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "I wore this to work under a silk V-neck cami and then to a post-work event—it lasted at least 10 hours, but I had to squish it back to my chest as it became loose all day long. I liked that this had round-shaped cups so that I didn't look too flat-chested. The clear tabs on the sides reached around too far on my back for me to wear this with something backless. For the amount of work it took to keep on, I'd rather just wear nipple covers than this with a deep V top." —Ashley, 32AA MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "I biked to work in this bra on an 80-degree day. I had a lot of physical work to do that day, carrying things and moving a lot and this bra never moved or made me feel like it was going to fall. It has become my favorite sticky bra ever. I even rode my bike back home from work that day and when the moment came to take it off, I really had to pull! I washed it with a little soap and left it hanging, per it's reuse instructions and wore it two days later. I had the same experience as the first time—it never moved or felt like it was unsticking. I thought it had a great shape, was comfortable, and was the perfect size." —Liesl, 32C LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "I fooled around with this bra for, like, 15 minutes before I decided to just change my outfit. I would literally rather try to figure out health insurance than learn how to stick this thing to my body in a way that makes sense for my boobs. Pass." —Hannah, 32DDD  
  You’ve absolutely seen a version of this bra as an ad on social media. You know the one, where the girl has it on, then smoothly zips the lacing together to boost her cleavage, puts on her top, and goes out the door? Anyway, this particular design comes with silicone cups in three different skin tones and a drawstring lace-up center detail. It works with most strapless and backless designs but isn’t great for anything super plunge-y. Quick bottom line: This guy isn’t as efficient and nice as it seems on the ’gram. The silicone in it is heavy and can weigh your boobs down and give them a shape you’re less than happy with. SMALL-CHESTED REVIEW "I got major Renaissance torture-chamber vibes from the string down the center of this bra. It took me five days to get the courage to try it on. When I finally did, I realized it was a clunkier approach to the cleavage-enhancing front clasp adhesive styles. The cups are bigger and heavier than other sticky bras and you can see the center string under any tight or slightly sheer fabric. It did stay on during the particularly hot and sweaty weather, but the removal process was more painful than all the other bras I tried. It remained hella sticky during my second wear too, but given the choice between this and a regular strapless bra, I'd go with a strapless bra." —Mia, 34A MEDIUM-CHESTED REVIEW "I used to have a bra like this and I loved it but it was lighter than this one. This one was heavy and made my boobs look like they were hanging when I wore them under a shirt. I decided not to wear it at all."—Liesl, 32C LARGE-CHESTED REVIEW "I always see bras like this on Instagram and as someone with D cups but no cleavage, I have been curious if it actually works or not. Sadly it didn't for me. No matter now many times I tried to reposition the cups and play around with different levels of tightness, nothing seemed to make my boobs look natural. The bra smashed my boobs down and pushed them unnaturally together. I tried to make it work so i could wear it out of the house, but I ended up wearing it around the house instead to test the stickiness and hold. It held up nicely for around four hours." —Shannon, 36D  The bras below didn’t make the final cut of our expansive photo shoot, but some reviewers really, really liked them—so we want you to know about them! Read all about our honorable mentions, below.

 "This was my fave of everything I tried on. Instead of a cup, it's just a big ole stretchy band-aid that you can cut and place however you like. These are better for backless or deep V styles, because they work best when they can go pretty high up on your collar to provide ample lift. I wore these for hours of sweaty dancing WITHOUT SLIPPAGE. I'm already planning on wearing them to a wedding I'm going to in the fall. Quick note: Boob Tape has the most painful removal of all the bras I tried, as well as a little leftover sticky residue, but it was worth it. My boobs have never felt both so supported and so free!" —Kara, 34D "HELLO cleavage! I have to admit I was skeptical of this style, which, at first, seemed like a big-ass bandage. When wrapped around my chest it puckered along the top ridge, but I wore it with a sorta low-cut off-the-shoulder top and it was super comfy while giving me the most cleavage of any bra I've aver worn. Period. It wasn't the most comfortable thing (see adhesive bandage across my chest). but after about 30 minutes, I almost forgot it was there. It did sorta hurt to take this one off and I would say to not wear this one under a tight outfit or thin fabric, as the puckering would show through!" —Jessica, 34D "These are the nipple covers you see everywhere and they definitely work well, stay on all day and do the job of keeping the nips flat. That being said, if you have sensitive skin, I've found that I have a red petal design that lasts days after I take them off sometimes. These get the job done, but I do think the silicone Nippies are the better option if you're willing to spend a little more—plus, they're reusable!" —Rachel, 36B

			 Don't stop, get it, get it. Bella Hadid wore a bright yellow suit to the Dior Homme show in Paris and looked like a tall glass of Gatorade on a warm day. Talk about long legs louise — girl is WORK, personified. And I need that outfit — it's the summer of neon suits, everyone. Fuck a bikini; I'm reading THIS to the beach.  The Daily Mail reported that Bella's nip slipped out of this very outfit, and to that I say: FREE THE NIP! This is now the summer of nip. The summer of nips and suits. Nips and suits comin' at you in summer 2018! Don't fight it!

			 Pay attention, class. In this lesson, RiRi demonstrates how to wear lingerie in public.  When Rihanna announced her upcoming lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, the Internet was collectively obsessed with the inclusive size range, and she's been teasing some seriously sexy photos ahead of its May 11 launch. Check them out:  But it seems like RiRi already has been wearing and modeling some lingerie pieces IRL. First, she posted this photo to Instagram on Saturday, when she wore a khaki belted top and slouchy beige pants with a fanny pack. She tagged @savagexfenty on the dark brown bra.  According to Savage X Fenty's Instagram feed, she's wearing the "Unlined Bra in the shade Cocoa." And if you guessed that the darker bra color means she's offering inclusive shades, you would be correct. Vogue confirmed her line will offer "a range of nude underwear that goes far beyond the bog-standard beige T-shirt bra."  Her second "Savage" outfit came on the same day when she posted a photo of this denim-shirt-as-a-top look, in which she literally wore a skirt over the "Cami top in Pearl" from her line and paired it with ripped denim jeans. For an even more OTT ensemble, she threw on a hot pink Marc Jacobs coat and blue-tinted shades later that day.  And her third time teasing her lingerie came when she wore this outfit on Saturday night at the Gucci store in Soho, where she was spotted wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap and matching Gucci coat over a sheer shirt. Underneath was none other than a Savage X Fenty bra. She completed her outfit with camouflage pants, black heels, and the same chain choker she wore earlier in the day.   Leave it to Rihanna to tease her yet-to-be-released lingerie collection by wearing it herself. Let her outfits show you how lingerie can be styled and worn in public because RiRi is basically the fashion queen. And, speaking of, you KNOW you can't wait to see what she wears to the Met Gala tonight. Maybe more Savage X Fenty lingerie? Anything is possible! Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 It's so much easier than you think. Ever look at your closet and think, "Wow, I only own black clothing!"? Well, you're not alone. Many people gravitate to black, white, and gray pieces, because they aren't exactly sure how to style a bunch of different colors. But fear not! Follow these steps to master color mixing — which is, as the name suggests, the art of matching various hues and patterns in an outfit — and create your own vibrant new look. 1. Go monochromatic. If the concept of mixing completely different colors is seriously freaking you out, start with one color, and really own it. I mean, wear that hue — and only that hue — in every piece of your outfit. The easiest way to get started is by wearing coordinating separates or a bold suit. Once you're ready to branch out more, start mixing in variations on tone, as this model does. Blush and rust are nearly alike, so this outfit counts as monochrome.  $46 SHOP NOW $139 SHOP NOW $183 SHOP NOW $200 SHOP NOW $192 SHOP NOW $139 SHOP NOW  Pearl Button Double Breasted Blazer, ELOQUII, $130; Rust Dress, CHRISTIAN SIRIANO, Not Available for Purchase; Blush Pants, CHRISTIAN SIRIANO, Not Available for Purchase; Milos Earrings, VITA FEDE, $165; Garson D'Orsay Pump, SIGERSON MORRISON, $350 2. Wear not-so-basic neutrals. Most people think of beige, brown, navy, black, gray, and olive green as neutrals, but plenty of other colors fall into this category, including metallics. Wearing gold or silver instead of traditional neutrals makes for an outfit that's way more fun. Once you've put on a shiny dress or top, match it with an equally bold pop of color, as seen on this model. Then you'll really make a statement.  $56 SHOP NOW $80 SHOP NOW $56 SHOP NOW $72 SHOP NOW $103 SHOP NOW $119 SHOP NOW  Moto Jacket, ELOQUII, $150; Gold Dress, ELOQUII, Not Available for Purchase; Drop Earrings, MANGO, Not Available for Purchase; Plei Shoe, SMASH SHOES, Not Available for Purchase 3. Use primary colors. If you're really ready to mix it up, begin with the primary colors: blue, red, and yellow. In case you don't remember from elementary-school art class, these three shades help create every other color. (Red plus blue makes purple, yellow plus blue makes green, and so on.) These tones look great color-blocked (meaning wearing one color as your top, and one as your bottom), or worn all together, as this model demonstrates with her striped ensemble.  $10 SHOP NOW $48 SHOP NOW $38 SHOP NOW $40 SHOP NOW $22 SHOP NOW $68 SHOP NOW  Striped Top, CF GOLDMAN, Not Available for Purchase; Nigella Wide Leg Pants, PH5, $285; Garson D'Orsay Pump, SIGERSON MORRISON, $350; Marissa Earrings, LAUREN HOPE, Not Available for Purchase 4. Think about analogous tones. All right, I'm going to bring up another elementary-school art idea: The color wheel. Remember it? Basically, it's the entire rainbow in a circle. Shades that are next to each other here are called analogous colors. Hues that are opposite each other are called contrasting colors.  Now that we've got that out of the way, generally speaking, colors that are next to each other on the wheel look great when styled together. As an example, check out this model's yellow and green look. Other great combos include green and blue, and pink and red. Give them a try, too!   $288 SHOP NOW $178 SHOP NOW $153 SHOP NOW $138 SHOP NOW $295 SHOP NOW $130 SHOP NOW  Yellow Jacket, CHRISTIAN SIRIANO, Not Available for Purchase; Green Dress, CHRISTIAN SIRIANO, Not Available for Purchase; Siren Earrings, VITA FEDE, $395; Zada Sandal Mules, MALONE SOULIERS, $695 5. Mix contrasting hues. Let's revisit the opposites on the color wheel. Just because they're on different sides doesn't mean they don't go together in an ensemble. The model in the image above illustrates this point with her bright yellow earrings and purple dress. If you want to take your mixing up a notch, try a style similar to the one the model is wearing in the photo below. She’s wearing contrasting colors but mixes tones by pairing a pastel-pink blouse and bralette with a jewel-toned green trouser.  $119 SHOP NOW $277 SHOP NOW $24 SHOP NOW $78 SHOP NOW $23 SHOP NOW $51 SHOP NOW  First photo: Velvet Jumpsuit, ELOQUII, Not Available for Purchase; Paper Lily Earrings, LELE SADOUGHI, $150.

It even has an extra pocket on the back for easy-to-access storage. Crisp new sheets are a great gift, especially if you’re in need of a twin-size set for your future college dorm room. Making your morning cup of joe at home is basically a necessity post–high school, because sometimes caffeine is the only thing that gets you through the day.

Whether you’re hoping to spruce up your future apartment or just frame nostalgic photos from school, a simple vintage design is super stylish. Your school backpack is probably so worn out from carrying all those heavy textbooks, so invest in a sophisticated one in a blush shade. Not only is it pretty, but it also has loads of storage pockets and you can wear it with or without the hook clasped. This tinted lip balm will become a major go-to thanks to its high-shine formula and plumping effects.

If you’re all about home decor, a modern vase that holds flowers is a simple gift that will really spruce up any place.

You’ll never have to stress about your low battery again with a rose gold charging stand. You may love wearing old T-shirts and shorts when you’re home, but post–high school is definitely a good time to invest in chic PJs like this striped collared set. Your future room is going to look freaking adorable with a picturesque comforter, which comes in multiple sizes to fit a twin, full, queen, or king bed. You’ll be obsessed with this fragrance that’s reminiscent of a seaside cliff blooming with fresh flowers. And the bottle is so pretty that it doubles as decor. You can’t beat the gift of great skin, and this set includes a cleansing oil, hydrating cream, skin mist, and more that will leave you with a dewy glow. This tiny speaker produces a LOT of bass, and its waterproof shell means you can take it in the shower or to the beach without worrying about water damage. Wireless headphones are truly a lifesaver.

Make instant memories with a cute Polaroid camera that you can take with you to your graduation party, on a road trip, to college, and beyond. The seaside scent of this elegant diffuser will make your room smell absolutely magical. A lot of changes happen post–high school, but a cute set of floral-print journals will help you keep track of all your thoughts. If you’re off to college after graduation, an organized desk space is key to keeping up with all those assignments. This bright magazine file will look pretty next to your laptop while keeping your work area mess-free. Not all presents have to be practical. Case in point: these playful striped slides that are perfect for the summer after graduation. If your wallet has seen better days, it’s worth spending money on a new zip one that will last. This leather style has 12 (!!!) card slots for peak organization. If you have any travel plans postgraduation, you’ll need a chic suitcase, like this pink four-wheel spinner with a protective lock and convenient built-in charging port. Graduating is the perfect excuse to get yourself a formal dress that you can wear for any and all fancy occasions. This one is subtly sexy with its backless design. These “suspender” earrings, which hook around your ear, definitely make a sparkly statement. This book is a series of autobiographical essays that explore issues of uncertainty, trust, loss, memory, desire, and place, emphasizing how to find—or lose—yourself in life’s experiences.

Get in on the style with this majorly discounted cream-colored one.   Another amazing deal? Levi's and Dockers are up to 50 percent off, and that includes these bootcut jeans. They'll look even better with a pair of trendy kitten heel ankle booties.  This pair of light wash jeans that has a subtle stretch and is just the right length when worn with heeled boots is also on sale, FYI.  If the wide leg silhouette isn't for you, high-waisted skinny jeans in a medium wash like these are calling your name. They'll be your new fave pair thanks to the amazing fit that reviewers rave about.  Select Kendall + Kylie pieces are up to 30 percent off including this striped shirt dress with the twist of a built-in denim belt. Pair it with patent leather boots to up the cool factor even more.  A basic long-sleeve T-shirt dress looks way more sexy with ruching details at the front. Wear it as short or as covered up as you want thanks to the adjustable ties.  A cropped jacket will look amazing with any high-waisted jeans, and the color will stand out from all your traditional blue denim pieces.  Handbags and shoes, like this sophisticated Calvin Klein pair, are also up to 30 percent off, PS. Wear these cool animal-print heels to the office or while you're out with your girls.  Short booties are great, you know, except for when there's snow on the ground and your ankles are freezing. Longer boots, like this Frye pair, keep them covered and will also look super stylish with skinny jeans.  A colorful crossbody bag could be just the thing you need to take your outfit from just OK to a total lewk. Plus, the multiple hues guarantee that it'll pair well with almost any ensemble.  Amazon is also offering up to 40 percent off men's and women's basics, if you're in the market for new bras or underwear. Looking for the perfect wireless style? This Bali bra—which has amazing reviews, BTW—just happens to be majorly discounted.  A super soft and comfortable bra that ALSO has great support is a rare find, yet this one has all those qualities and doesn't cost a ton. Plus, reviewers are obsessed with its cushiony feel and coverage.   Arguably nothing rivals the glorious feeling of buying and wearing brand new underwear—especially if it's in a cut and pattern you love. Enter: this Maidenform pair that provides full-coverage (if you're into that), but doesn't look matronly thanks to its polka-dot pattern, cute bow, and sexy lace trim.  A sale is the perfect reason to not only buy things for yourself, but to get all your gift-giving plans squared away. Any guy would appreciate a set of brand new boxers—especially when they're in a festive tartan pattern.  Men's fashion from Amazon's brands is also up to 50 percent off so you can score a fresh burgundy cardigan that looks super fancy without the expensive price tag.  Consider this a formal petition for more guys to wear turtlenecks because they look so handsome in them. Get a gray cashmere one for the guy in your life—he can wear it with plenty of outfits during the colder months.  A denim shirt is a classic staple every guy should have, so if he doesn't, get him this western one in a darker wash that pair well with all his khakis and chinos.

			 Ain’t no laws when you’re dressing up as the Claws. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Yandy, the costume company behind risqué Mr. Rogers and hot tariff, has debuted a fizzy new Halloween number in the form of a sexy White Claw can—just in time for spooky season.  The so-called Hard Outlaw two-piece costs $54.95 and features the words “Outlaw, Party Hard” (a play on the meme “Ain’t no laws when you’re drinking the Claws”) on the front and “#Darty” on the butt. “Who’s up for a day party?” the official description reads on Yandy.com. “Lay down the law of liquid refreshments. Life is hard to handle without that 5 percent bubbly buzz. Be the sweetest seltzer on the shelf and sip away your Saturday in this thirst-quenching exclusive Hard Outlaw costume....Grab some of your favorite gals and wear different “flavored” stockings for the best group costume!” A Yandy representative says Hard Outlaw has been in the works ever since spiked seltzer became the drink of Hot Girl Summer 2019. They logged it in a spreadsheet of Halloween costume ideas, then tapped one of their in-house designers to create the final look.  “We’ve seen a huge trend in spiked seltzer drinks and they are wildly popular with our team too,” Alicia Thompson, Yandy’s director of brand marketing, told Elle.com. “This costume was created in a two-piece bodysuit style and uses the popular hashtag trending on social.” The costume doesn’t come with the leggings pictured on Yandy’s website, but Thompson suggests styling Hard Outlaw with neon-colored fishnets to give a little “flavor” to the costume.  Yandy’s release marks one of the first official spiked seltzer costumes available to buy, and many Twitter users think it’s in the running to be this year’s most  popular Halloween costume.   How many girls will slap a White Claw logo on a bandage dress and call it a Halloween costume? pic.twitter.com/kA3AzULCyI Would it be acceptable for me to dress up as a white claw for Halloween? Taking estimates on %population dressing as white claw this halloween also taking suggestions on a white claw costume w a twist (e.g. witchy white claw, murderous white claw, perhaps most horrifying- empty case of white claw) I think I'm gonna dress up as a whiteclaw for Halloween so girls will finally want me I can’t wait to be the most basic girl ever and dress up as a white claw for Halloween halloween costume of the year: a can of white claw who wants to dress up as the different white claw flavors for Halloween with me Take a shot for every white claw Halloween costume you see this year remember that year every girl was a can of four loko for Halloween? this year it will be the white claw year. #braceyourself

			 There’s no such thing as being too early. Here’s my biased opinion: October 31 is THE best day of the year—you get tons of free candy, get to watch scary movies, and can dress up as pretty much anything you want. Spooky season is already here and Target has officially begun to celebrate—you can now purchase an insane number of costumes from the retail store’s huge selection of Halloween costumes. Target’s range of costumes will literally blow your mind: From pop-culture nods like Eleven’s classic wig-and-pink-dress combo from Stranger Things to an adult Forky costume from Toy Story 4 to group family costumes, you’ll find everything you’d ever want (or need). There are also costumes specially designed for children who use wheelchairs, like an adorable princess carriage and a fun pirate ship. And the best part? Every single costume featured in Target’s Halloween line is priced below $50. Every. Single. Costume. With a deal like that, you might as well stock up on costumes for the whole family—including your pets. Some of the cutest pet costumes Target is selling are the slew of Star Wars–themed ones, an adorable Dorothy costume from the Wizard of Oz, and even an elf costume—hey, it’s never too early to prepare for Christmas either! The store also has a ton of Halloween decor along with the costumes, so Target can be your one-stop shop this spooky season.

			 Maleficent, Ursula, and Cruella de Vil at #NYFW is EVERYTHING! Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? URSULA THE SEA WITCH, THAT'S WHO! Fashion designers The Blonds collaborated with Disney for their Spring/Summer 2019 collection, which features looks that channel the devious baddies from your favorite movies. "Disney Villains have long lived in the dark shadows of the beloved heroes and heroines of their stories," Ken Potrock, president of consumer products and commercialization at Disney told WWD, "and yet these characters are just as celebrated."  "The villains are meant to be secondary characters," The Blonds creative director David Blond wrote in the show notes, "but they have always stood out to us because they have the best style, [and] the most personality."  According to People, the designers did their research and dug through the Disney Archive Research Library "to better understand each villain’s mythology, and viewed original artwork and sculpts." See a selection of the bibbidy-bobbidy-boo-tiful looks below: Yes, that's Paris Hilton on the runway—with a teacup puppy, of course! Another standout Cruella look actually had the Dalmatian-obsessed antagonist's face bedazzled onto a dress, complete with dramatic black and white furry fringes for her hair. And if you pay attention to the details, even the model's nails—which were painted by nail experts CND—are a Dalmatian-spotted pattern. Meanwhile, YouTube makeup artist Patrick Starr fully committed and embodied Ursula, with two models playing the sea witch's pet eels Flotsam and Jetsam. Literally, a pair of people cos-playing as Flotsam and Jetsam is going to be next spring's hottest accessory.   Designer and The Blonds co-founder Phillipe Blond modeled an Evil Queen look (among other designs)—a dramatic number with a shiny golden cape, endorned with a mosaic of Snow White's heart pierced through with a dagger.  One of Disney's most underrated, hair-raising, children nightmare-inducing villains, IMO. But looking good here, it must be noted. No Disney villain-themed runway show would not be complete without multiple Maleficent-inspired looks! While actress Dominique Jackson, a star of FX's Pose, took on the Sleeping Beauty character's dragon form in a sculptural bejeweled corset and ripped jeans, 10-year-old "Drag Kid"  Desmond is Amazing walked down the runway as Maleficent in all her fierce crow glory. Look at those nails! This is Disney's first-ever villains fashion franchise. And the Blonds also designed regular, everyday—yet, still equally edgy—villain looks for fashion e-tailer Lauren Moshi. Just, you know, in case you can't incorporate a horned bedazzled bodice into your wardrobe. (But, tbh, you totally could/should.) Follow Jasmine on Instagram.

			 This bird has the fiercest smize. Vogue has released the cover for its April 2018 issue and the star is someone very unexpected!  A bird! And not just any bird: It's a yellow-crested cockatoo, which is a tropical species found in Indonesia's islands of Sulawesi and Lesser Sundas. It has white feathers on its body and a pompadour of bright yellow plumage on the top of its head. This is all information that I got from Wikipedia. Please go there to learn more about this medium-sized, winged creature (which also happens to have a critically endangered status on the endangered species list). OK, fine. While this bird has the face of an angel, it is not the only model on the April cover. Kendall Jenner is also there, clad in a frilly pink design. The bird is touching its beak to her eyebrow and sitting on her finger.  Surprisingly for some (me), the interview inside the magazine doesn't really mention the bird. It just talks about how Kendall, "the world's highest-paid model," is rethinking her life and career.   For one, she's slowing down some on the modeling front, focusing more on riding horses, and taking time for herself. "At the end of your life," she says, "You're not going to care that you worked every day and you made this much money. You're going to care about the relationships that you've built and the bonds that you have and the love that you've created. That's what you're going to care about. That's my whole thing: what you leave behind." She also talks about her dating life, sexuality, and that infamous Pepsi ad. Vogue's April 2018 issue is available on newsstands in New York and Los Angeles on March 20 and nationwide on March 27. Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

			 Gold medal-worthy looks right this way! From sexy backless numbers to classic tutus (and even suspenders!), here's a look at all the best skating costumes hitting the ice in PyeongChang. The Team USA skater wore an entirely bedazzled long-sleeve shirt with multicolored blue rhinestones and dark blue pants.  The Japanese figure skater and gold medalist wore a white long-sleeve shirt with gold embellishments and teal accents on the shoulders and sleeves.  The British ice dancers both wore shimmery black ensembles — Buckland wore a beaded black shirt, while his partner Coomes wore a '20s-looking costume with silver rhinestones and a fringe skirt.  While Cizeron opted for a simple pant-and-shirt combo, Papadakis dazzled (despite her unfortunate wardrobe malfunction) in an emerald-green fringe costume with a halter neck and rhinestone-studded waist.  IRL couple, ice-dancing pair, and American skaters Chock and Bates looked like quite the team with their ensembles. Chock's costume was the center of attention with its bright primary color scheme, mesh insert, and feathers, while Bates used red as an accent color on his shirt to match.  Austman represented Canada in this gorgeous black V-neck costume featuring rhinestones and extra beads around her neck.  The Belgian figure skater wore an incredible catsuit with aqua rhinestones and mesh insets along her legs. She pulled back her hair into a braided ponytail and looked sleek and aerodynamic as hell.  The Russian skater and 15-year-old gold medalist seemed like she took a style cue from Black Swan when she hit the ice in this black and white sequin costume with a ballerina-approved tutu.  The figure-skating pair represented Poland in matching blue outfits. Kaliszek wore a cobalt blue dress with sheer sleeves, while her partner chose a dapper velvet blazer and a white collared shirt.  The French athlete already wowed viewers with her performance set to Beyoncé's music, but she surprised everyone again when she changed costumes midway through her routine to reveal dazzling multi-colored rhinestones under her skirt.  The German figure skater wore this amazing pink shirt/grey pinstripe pant combo, and he really worked those suspenders. Strike a pose, Paul!  It looks like the French husband-and-wife ice-dancing duo got lost in their dance moves during their performance. Lauriault wore a neon one-shoulder costume with purple embellishments, while her husband matched in a purple collared shirt with a plunging V-neck.  Besseghier, a French skater, channeled a cab driver with his look. It featured an undone yellow and black checkered bow tie and a patch that read "Taxi" on his grey ombré shirt.  The South Korean ice-dancing team's routine was so sexy, Min's shirt almost came off. Wardrobe malfunction aside, the pair killed it on the ice performing to "Despacito" — Min wore a red dress with side cutouts and ruffles, while Gamelin used red as an accent color on the collar of his black costume.  One of Russia's top skaters, Medvedeva wore a dark blue and purple costume with intricate weaving at the neckline. For an outfit so elegant and beautiful, it's hard to believe she performed her short program around the theme of “clinical death.”   Keeping with the same color scheme, South Korea's skater wore a fiery red shirt bedazzled with rhinestones. His costume really brought the drama, and so did his amazing hair flip,TBH.  The American skater took a more modest approach (i.e., no plunging neckline) with his black and grey costume, but he still looked super slick. And although his no-fuss outfit seemed aerodynamic AF, he fell during the men's short program — but he still looked great doing it! The Japanese skater wore an incredibly sexy (and see-through) black mesh shirt with extra purple fabric resembling feathers and velvet pants in the men's single skating short program. And just look at that incredible concentration! The German ice-dancing pair went for a Great Gatsby-inspired look with their dressy outfits. Savchenko wore a flapper-like silver dress with fringe, while Massot wore a grey vest, red bow tie, and a collared shirt.  The pairs figure skaters representing North Korea definitely brought their A-game in these shimmery metallic costumes with rhinestones. The Japanese ice dancers competed in the figure-skating team event wearing saucy, brightly-hued outfits. Reed added a pop of pink to his collar, but the real showstopper was Muramoto's orange, pink, and black fringe dress with a massive side cutout.  The French athletes performed in the pair skating short program in contrasting black and blue costumes. Ciprès kept it classic in a black outfit (with extra sheer sleeves), but James stood out on the ice in her bold blue chiffon number with strappy cutouts.  German ice dancers Lorenz and Polizoakis competed in the figure skating team event wearing black and bright pink costumes. Lorenz stunned in this statement-making costume which included a fringe skirt, a deep V-neckline, and frilly sleeves.  The Japanese athletes skated in the pairs short program in matching teal outfits. Suzaki's costume featured pleats on the bodice of her dress, rhinestones on the straps, and a flowing skirt, while Kihara wore a collared shirt (also with rhinestones, duh) and navy pants.  The French skater looked absolutely regal in this belted gold and black jumpsuit, and she performed to the music of none other than Queen Bey.  The South Korean figure skater competed in the team event wearing this ombré number with flowing sleeves and a sweetheart neckline. Her costume gave off serious mermaid vibes with its aqua color scheme. The adorable pair (on and off the ice!) competed for the United States in the figure-skating team event –in these minimal but chic grey and lilac costumes. Chris wore a simple light grey shirt, while Alexa wore a purple long-sleeve dress with a high neckline.  Canadian pairs skaters Duhamel and Radford pulled off an impressive lift in their matching burgundy costumes. Duhamel wore a halter-neck outfit with a flowing chiffon skirt, and her partner wore a long-sleeve shirt with the added sex appeal of mesh and rhinestones.  China's Li Xiangning competed during the figure-skating team event in the short program wearing a multicolored blue dress with ruching and mesh detail. With the bright colors, she really stood out on the ice rink.   The men's single skater from Italy competed in the figure-skating team event –in a suit with gold embroidery on his vest and sleeves. His threw in some dramatic gestures for an added flourish.

			 NYT Opinion Twitter account is an expert-level troll.  The New York Times opinion page account is Twitter's current clown prince — poking at the sides of the masses with a fun stick until we all explode from rage as it collects page views like a fat kid in a cake line.

This set off some other fashion tips — it's important to look cute when you're running for your life! Yoga pants- they offer flexibility and won’t hinder crouching, plus, if you have to hide in a closet, no extra bulk. Everyone should wear yoga pants. I’d recommend new balance sneakers. Little pricey, but comfortable, decent for running for your life, and they’re very hip these days. I think you can't go wrong with body armor in pastel colors. Have you tried thoughts and prayers? It's almost like you're wearing nothing. I think I'll just end there! Oh wait, first I want to know — who's marching on March 24?

			 Fans are flocking to the Frances Valentine website to get their hands on her last pieces.  After news broke of Kate Spade's apparent suicide on Tuesday, fans have been buying the final designs from her most recent accessory brand, Frances Valentine, causing almost all the items on the site's "New Arrivals" page to sell out. The sold-out products include Spade's handbags, totes, earrings, necklaces, and shoes.  The only new pieces that aren't sold out are two metallic sandals (pictured below), which are available for pre-order, and red Mary Jane leather flats. However, there's still inventory of her less recent designs on the site.  The rate at which Spade's quirky, colorful products are selling out is a testament to the designer's talent and unique vision, and it shows how much her loyal fans want to own a part of her legacy.  Frances Valentine posted a touching Instagram tribute to its late founder on Wednesday, stating that she'll "remain in our hearts forever." The fate of the brand is uncertain in the wake of her death.  If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 One has already sold for $500. The sold-out, controversial jacket from Zara that Melania Trump wore to visit immigrant children in Texas last week is now being auctioned off on eBay, according to The Washington Post. Although the original cost of the coat was just $39, a secondhand version was sold for $500, while two more are still on auction, with one going for $610 and the other for $895 as of press time. The motivations of the buyers are unclear. At least one person on re-selling app Poshmark noted, per The Cut, that they hoped to get the jacket as "a Halloween costume." If you're not sure what the jacket fuss is about, here's a quick recap: On June 21, FLOTUS flew to Texas to visit 2,000 immigrant children who were taken from their parents and detained. When she got on her plane at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, she was photographed in the now-infamous outerwear, which had "I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?" written in white paint on the back. People had feelings about it. The First Lady did end up changing into a different coat when she got to her final destination. "She wants to see what is real," Melania's spokesperson, Stephanie Grisham, said of the reason behind FLOTUS's trip, adding that Melania asked her husband to come, but he didn't.  When reporters asked Grisham what the jacket's message was all about, she responded, "It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe." Today’s visit w the children in Texas impacted @flotus greatly. If media would spend their time & energy on her actions & efforts to help kids - rather than speculate & focus on her wardrobe - we could get so much accomplished on behalf of children. #SheCares #ItsJustAJacket Later on, President Trump tweeted that the jacket did in fact have a plain-to-see message, and it was directed at the media. “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” written on the back of Melania’s jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares! Since the garment's debut, a website called ireallydocare.com has been set up, which allows users to donate to 14 groups that help immigrants, and clothing company Wildfang designed a new jacket with the words, "I REALLY DO CARE," which is now sold out, that benefitted RAICES, a Texas-based nonprofit offering low-cost legal services to immigrant families and refugees.

			 And by eating hot dogs and playing rosé pong, naturally.  Labor Day weekend has come and gone, but I'm trying to relive it through the latest Kardashian-Jenner pics. Their holiday weekend looked truly amazing, and I'm just a *little* offended I wasn't invited.  Let's take a look at what Kourt, Kim, and Kendall wore on a Malibu beach on Sunday: Kenny hit us with a lime green bikini by Sommer Swim—it's a color she's been a real fan of lately.   Kim also went with a bold color choice in a neon bikini and a towel fashionably wrapped around her. Side note though: Does anyone else have trouble getting their towel to stay up like this or is it just me? Really not sure how she managed to keep this up around her waist while throwing a football.   Beach Ballin’ 🏖 🏀 @kimkardashian #kimkardashian A post shared by  KIM K x KYLIE (@kimkxkylie) on Sep 2, 2018 at 11:55pm PDT She also bounced around and selfie-d on a trampoline in said bikini.  @kendalljenner via @kimkardashian Instagram Story #kendalljenner  #kendalljennersnapchat A post shared by  Kendall ♡ (@kendalljennersnapchats) on Sep 3, 2018 at 3:29pm PDT Then Kourt wore this high-cut denim blue bikini and, like, her abs are almost unreal.    On Labor Day itself, the trio hosted what looks like a killer party complete with cake fights, rosé pong, and this delicious-looking guac that Kourt made. Again, where was my invite?!  @kendalljenner via @kimkardashian Instagram Story #kendalljenner #kourtneykardashian #kendalljennersnapchat A post shared by  Kendall ♡ (@kendalljennersnapchats) on Sep 3, 2018 at 3:33pm PDT She wore a white-hot bikini with a matching lace skirt, but it's hard to get a good look because I'm STILL looking at the guacomole, TBH.  Kendall wore a red bikini, and looked seriously happy about not having to work on a Monday.  Later, her swimwear got completely covered in cake, which is unfortunate, because I would've totally eaten that icing.   @kendalljenner via @jordynwoods Instagram Story #kendalljenner #bellahadid #kendalljennersnapchat A post shared by  Kendall ♡ (@kendalljennersnapchats) on Sep 4, 2018 at 12:10pm PDT Bella Hadid was also there, not making her rosé pong shots (I feel you on that, Bella!). Regardless, her bikini featuring a little collar was *so, so* cute.    @kendalljenner via Instagram Story #kendalljenner #bellahadid #kendalljennersnapchat A post shared by  Kendall ♡ (@kendalljennersnapchats) on Sep 3, 2018 at 3:45pm PDT  And there ya have it! Another bikini-packed Kar-Jenner LDW for the books. Until next year, folks. Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Investigating a very serious issue.  A few weeks ago, Mindy Kaling tweeted, "I think we will regret this tiny sunglasses look." She was reacting to something we've all watched with wonder over the past year: the curious case of the shrinking shades.  First there was Kanye West famously dictating to wife Kim Kardashian over e-mail that she no longer wear big sunglasses if she wants to be cool. Then Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner jumped on the trend, as did major fashion designers like Alexander Wang and Adam Selman. Kristen Stewart recently also wore teensy gold frames at Cannes. But while the red carpet and pap snaps show us one thing, Twitter shows us another: a bunch of confused people (and celebs) who are 100 percent not on the same page. "I remember this moment in the mid 90's #regret," Reese Witherspoon responded to Kaling. Busy Phillips admitted to buying a pair but never wearing them. Padma Lakshmi simply sent two cry-laughing emojis. Kaling's tweet went viral, showing up on various Instagram meme pages and garnering more than 105,000 likes and 17,000 retweets to date. So what's the answer? Are we for or against these Matrix-esque shades? How long will they stick around? And the biggest question of all: Was Kanye right? Trend-setting is cyclical, according to Dr. Vanessa Brown, professor at the School of Art and Design at Nottingham-Trent University and author of Cool Shades: The History and Meaning of Sunglasses.  "One thing you can guarantee with fashion is that when things have reached an extreme aesthetically, they'll swing the opposite direction," she says. So as soon as glasses grew so big and bug-eyed that they were covering your whole face, around the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, that's when small shades started popping up on celebrity faces and infiltrating your Instagram feed. Stella McCartney, Adam Selman, and Roberi & Fraud were among the first brands to lead the charge last year.  Plus, when the masses start wearing a fad, it suddenly becomes uncool to the It crowd, so designers and style stars start asking themselves, "What's the bravest and seemingly weirdest thing to do?" Behold: baby shades. "Small frames are new and exciting," says Hamish Tame, creative director for Australian sunglasses brand Le Specs, which carries many a tiny frame. "We've lived through so many years of the heavy, oversize trends that now it feels fresh and liberating to wear a pair of small sunglasses." When you think about slim shades, you may think of the ones that were popular in the '90s — but Brown says those tiny glasses actually harken back to the '60s, when The Beatles popularized them. The small metal frames The Beatles wore from brands like Ray-Ban were an effort to bring back a simpler version of the accessory — it was a statement of skepticism of the new materials and technologies being used elsewhere. At the time, most other sunglasses, particularly by designer Paco Rabanne, used porous, bendable plastic, lending them an alien, futuristic vibe.   Brown thinks this new wave could mean that people once again are "worried about the future and concerned about what progress and technology has brought to us." (A simpler explanation: They're merely concerned about ski goggle-like tan lines.) The political idea may seem like a leap, but Brown thinks it's more about subconscious expression: "When people design things, whether they do it knowingly or not, they're resolving tensions and problems that exist in their minds," she says. "The things that end up becoming popular can help people reconcile."  In a word: Yes. "Our customer is definitely embracing slim sun," says Erica Russo, fashion director for accessories at Bloomingdale's, adding that they still stock plenty of larger shapes. "There are definitely different ways to approach the trend, and we bought into more of the cat-eye version, because that can be much more flattering." Tiny shades aren't going anywhere anytime soon. You're still going to see the Bella Hadids of the world wearing them out and about in NYC or in selfies on Instagram. "We still have a lot to explore with the narrow styles, where we can start to experiment with shapes and materials," Tame says, referring to geometric looks like hexagons and interesting iterations of metallics and plastics.  "I would give the micro moment at least another few years." For you doubters out there, Tame does offer a glimmer of hope about the Great Shrink: "Any smaller, and we'd be wearing paper clips."

			 Who wore it best? On Thursday, Kylie Jenner posted this photo to Instagram of herself and Stormi taking a walk around the neighborhood, appropriately captioning the pic "Stormi strolls." But because she's Kylie Jenner, this was no ordinary outing with her baby. She dressed up for the occasion and wore a body-hugging vintage Fendi dress, neutral boots by Acne Studios, and white ankle socks. But the real kicker is that she matched her look to Stormi's stroller, also designed by Fendi.  The stroller, not including the furry cover, retails for $1,900 FYI. Consider this a twinning moment for the books, because honestly I don't know who wore the Fendi monogram print better.  Who says an afternoon walk with your baby can't be fashionable? She is STRUTTING like the street is her personal runway.  Jenner is seemingly making sure that Stormi is up to date on all the trends, because the Fendi monogram is having a major moment right now. Kim Kardashian is also a fan of the logo look, and Nicki Minaj wore something similar for the release of her new song "Chun-Li." Stormi is one fashionable baby, designer stroller and all.

			 After two years and 40 prototypes, it's here.  According to pretty much everyone, comfortable underwear should be the standard. On Monday, eco-friendly e-retailer Everlane launched a minimalist set of lingerie with comfort in mind, and as is typical with the brand, the waitlist is already ridiculous. It is currently over  28,420, and most likely going to climb even higher.  The collection includes four styles of underwear (The Thong, The Bikini, The Hipster, and The High-Rise Hipster), a wireless bra, and a bodysuit, all made of super breathable Supima cotton. Oh, and everything is priced under $30, too.     The campaign stars body positive actress Jemima Kirke and an inclusive roster of models, highlighting the brand's mission to cater to everyone. Along with the launch, Everlane sent out a letter signed by their female employees with their mission behind the collection: "No frills. No bows. No bullshit."   To: Everyone From: The Women of Everlane #LoveYourUnderwear for women (and men). A post shared by  Everlane (@everlane) on Mar 20, 2018 at 11:51am PDT For days you don't feel like being confined to underwires, itchy lace, and downright unbearable strappy situations, cop Everlane's line of underthings now.

			 (You can even use some of these, too, just don’t tell him!)  The thing about getting a present for your boyfriend or S.O. is that it’s VERY tricky. If you’ve been dating for a month or two, it’s hard to know just yet what he likes (or dislikes), which is not helpful. On the flip side, if you’ve been dating for years, then you’re probably all out of great ideas. See what I mean? And if he wasn’t nice enough to leave you a wish list—or at least leave some tabs open on his laptop with some hints—you might be in a tough spot right now. Luckily, we’re here to help. Whether you’re still waiting to DTR or you live together, here are 38 unique birthday gift ideas for boyfriends of all stages. So shop away, or if all else fails, go with a funny gift to take the stress off.  Nothing like a birthday to make your long-distance relationship feel more like a lonely dating relationship. Send an instant reminder that you’re thinking of your boyfriend on his birthday (and every other day) with these light-up bracelets. If your guy wears a uniform, suits, or scrubs every day, getting ready probably feels a bit monotonous. But with this sock subscription service, which sends a surprise pair each month, getting ready doesn’t have to be so boring. It’s his birthday, so he can drink in the shower if he wants to. And with this speaker and bottle holder in one, shower time is basically party time. The best gifts are simple and heartfelt. This wooden cutout card with a sweet customizable message is one your boyfriend will save forever. Birthdays are great for reminding you of (1) how old you are and (2) all the experiences on your bucket list that are yet to be had. This book is the perfect gift for the adventurer who’s constantly looking to plan his next trip. Navy-blue kicks with wool fabric are the perfect addition to his winter wardrobe, and this pair has more than 450 reviews with a 4-star rating, so you know they’re good. Get him a shirt that’s not like his others in the form of a plaid button-up with surprisingly silky, soft fabric. This one is so comfy that he’ll wear it over and over again. He loves to jam out to his Spotify playlists, so get him a Bluetooth speaker with amazing sound quality so he can listen to them out loud. If he’s all about whipping up a gourmet meal at home, then he’s gonna need the right pots and pans. A brand-new 10-piece set of stainless steel cookware is easy to clean and looks good in any kitchen. A fancy electric trimmer and shaver might not be the most romantic gift, but if he’s serious about his grooming habits, then a lightweight do-it-all tool is definitely for him. Unwinding after a long day is important, and sometimes you just need to chill out with a good ol’ video game. Get him the Switch and you can play Mario Kart to both your hearts’ content. Football is back, baby! He’s probably v excited to sit and watch all the games, so get him a knit beanie with his team’s logo that he can wear out. Not every guy is a jewelry person, and that’s okay! But a woven bracelet with an easy clasp is subtle yet cool if he likes wearing something around his wrist. A duffel bag is basically a necessity in every guy’s closet, and it’s the perfect size to use as a carry-on or to take on a quick weekend getaway. He’ll like the muted tones, the ample storage, and the luxe leather trim. A travel bag definitely comes in handy when you’re, well, traveling, so booking a surprise trip to a place you’ve both wanted to visit is a great birthday idea. I mean, just look at this dreamy Airbnb near Joshua Tree National Park. He’ll look like the coolest dude on the block in a pair of classic black sunglasses. This anti-scratch acetate pair can also be fitted for prescription lenses. A water-resistant watch with a leather strap and blue face will go with both his dressy and casual outfits. If he’s the outdoorsy type, a durable hammock he can hook to any tree is a thoughtful gift. The two of you can cozy up in this together the next time you hit the trails, and it folds into a compact carrier after use. Golf balls are a great gift for golfers, albeit a little basic and obvious. But pair that box of Titleist balls with a personalized golf ball stamp, and you’ve got a genius gift idea. Beer bottle koozies are cool in theory (literally), but they don’t do the best job at keeping a beer cold on a hot summer day. Enter: this stainless steel insulated holder to keep his bottles cold and easy to transport. Framed maps are cool and all, but this wooden world map is a unique take on wall art. Any traveler would love to fill up space in their room with this decorative idea. Don’t let anyone tell you a gift card is a lame idea. If the guy is impossible to shop for, keep it easy and go with an Amazon gift card so he can get whatever the hell he wants. This one comes in a cool metal tin that he can keep and use for storage later. He’s gotta have some place to put his b-day gift cards, right? If the guy dresses better than anyone you know, he deserves this trendy card-holder wallet. If your S.O. is constantly asking for help working out a knot in his tight, sore muscles, make it easier on the both of you with this handheld massaging device. If your S.O. uses as much creamer as he does coffee, he’d be stoked to get one of these heat-regulating coffee mugs for his birthday. Just connect it to his phone and keep the temperature consistently heated through the app. This crewneck sweatshirt is comfy without being too casual, which means your boyfriend can wear it when he needs to look nice yet still be cozy. A win-win. No one likes warm beer. This icicle bottle topper will keep your boyfriend’s beer cold the entire time he drinks it—yes, even those last few sips. Not just any charging station, this bad boy has a place for a phone and tech gadgets as well as compartments for jewelry and accessories. Now he can keep all his most prized possessions in one easy-to-find place. When you realize how much you spend on sparkling water over the course of a few months, this at-home carbonator won’t sound all that expensive. If your guy loves him a bubbly beverage, get him this cool little kitchen gadget. If the dude is into grilling, a Himalayan salt plate will change his world. He can use it to flavor the meat or fish when cooking or use it as a platter to serve cheeses and appetizers. What’s better than a neck pillow when traveling? A neck pillow that also massages to make the long haul a little more bearable. The pillows in first class don’t even have massagers, so HA! Take that. I can think of no better party game than this putting green and pool table hybrid. Whether your guy likes golf or just likes to have a good time, this is the gift for him. If sentimental gifts are more your style, a picture frame with photos of the people your man loves will make anyone’s day. This one holds Fujifilm Instax Mini photos and is the perfect way to display instant pics from his birthday party. If the guy likes to run or work out, he’ll appreciate having these detachable ear hooks for his AirPods to prevent them from slipping out during even the most rigorous of workouts. If he’s the kind of guy who’d pick a cocktail over a cold one, give your boyfriend a set of tools to upgrade his bar cart. This one comes with ice tongs, a double jigger, a strainer, and a bottle opener as well as a rack to hold them all in. If he wants to smell warm and fresh and get all the compliments, this fragrance is the perfect blend of spice and citrus with notes of patchouli, vetiver, bergamot, and cardamom. If your boyfriend’s still carrying the Jansport he had before you guys started dating, upgrade his style with this practical, sleek, water-resistant bag that’s perfect to tote back and forth from work. If the new iPhone 11 isn’t in the budget, solve his iPhone troubles and free up plenty of storage space with this little gadget. It can easily download pictures off his phone and transfer them to any other digital device.

			 It's also waterproof! ASOS has left its mark in the fashion industry as one of the most inclusive retailers, from featuring models with stretch marks to offering collections for the curvy, tall, and petite shoppers to collaborating with LGBTQ organizations. Now, in an effort to be even more representative of all types of shoppers, the British online beauty and fashion company has specifically designed a jumpsuit for people in wheelchairs. The idea came about after Paralympic athlete Chloe Ball-Hopkins, who uses a wheelchair, became soaked in the rain at a music festival and subsequently sent an email to ASOS about creating a product that would fit wheelchair users. From there, the tie-dye jumpsuit was born and Ball-Hopkins was chosen to model the design.  The components that make the $64 jumpsuit special include: the waterproof pocket on the breast (to store your phone in), the top and jacket zip together around the waist or can be worn separately, the hem's a little longer in the back so it doesn't ride up, and there are adjustable sleeve cuffs. Basically, the whole jumpsuit is meant for getting in to and out of easily.  Ball-Hopkins shared the exciting news on her Twitter, writing, it's all about making "fashion accessible" to everyone. So over the last several months I have been working with @ASOS to create a fashionable, yet practical waterproof all in one! Not just for people like me in a chair but for anyone. It's about making fashion accessible! So what should be next?! https://t.co/1gzzkRlED9 pic.twitter.com/7yS57QEmpD Of course, the positive support has been pouring in from around the internet with many Twitter users praising both the athlete and ASOS for creating the inclusive jumpsuit.  How cool is it that  @ASOS have teamed up with Chloe Ball-Hopkins to create this cool wheelchair user friendly jumpsuit. Love their acceptance of diversity & disability. Now we need other brands to recognise this too!! #equality #diversity #fashion #acceptance #change pic.twitter.com/JYvlCST7aY @ASOS created a Wheelchair friendly jumpsuit! it's not everyone's cup of tea but seriously HOW AMAZING is this! Deigned w disabled people! pic.twitter.com/4z8B9J4JxT ASOS went one step further and designed a jumpsuit for people in a wheelchair. More of this please 🙏🏻♿ https://t.co/BMWtx7isEK You can purchase the jumpsuit, below:

			 Also though, this is very convenient? Hi! Are you looking for a way to be the most this summer while actually doing the least? Nike, thank god, has got you covered.

Fanny Pack Benassi JDI Slides, Nike SHOP SOON The slides have a small zippered pouch along the strap for literally everything you need: Spare change! A tampon! Bite-size Snickers so you'll never go hungry! A super tiny vibrator! A Royal Wedding commemorative cupcake topper! Your keys! OK, so you may be wondering: Do I actually need this? Do I actually like these? Why does this shoe exist? A huge fucking "YES" to all of these because it's Summer 2018 and you deserve a shoe that can do both  everything.

			 Aerie's just-announced spokes model on how influencing people is about way more than how many followers you have. Cleo Wade is an influencer. With over 450,000 followers—and counting—taking in her empowering Insta mantras touting self-acceptance, knowing your worth, and overcoming heartbreak, she's truly owning that space. So it's no surprise that the 30-year-old Heart Talk author has been tapped by Aerie to be its newest #AerieREAL role model.  Of course, the new position means she now appears in (always unretouched!) campaign imagery for the brand, but she's also taking that title very seriously. She recently opened up to Cosmopolitan about what it really means to be a role model (Hint: It's not just about being a nice famous person.) Scroll on for all the tea and more nuggets of wisdom you really ought to know. For a long time we confused people that have a lot of eyes on them as being role models and the key difference between someone who is a role model and someone who isn’t is that those who are wake up every morning with the intention of having their work—or what they stand for—be a template for the next generation.   With celebrity and online culture we see these breakdowns happen with people at some point because they say, 'I’m not a role model. I never said I wanted to be one,' because really they wanted to be an entertainer or a business woman. I think we can celebrate everyone for their individual missions and we don’t have to make anyone feel like they are lesser than because we think if they do have influence they should be doing X, Y, or Z when really, people should be chasing their dreams. 
  As a writer and someone who gets up every morning with the goal of being an active citizen, if people like Gloria Steinem never existed, I wouldn’t even know where to start. I feel similarly about James Baldwin, Alice Walker, and Maya Angelou.  I think we have been living with really oppressive standards—whether it’s beauty or law or policy. As women and as people of color we are not where we need to be. We thought we were free, but we're not free. We're seeing how voter suppression happens all over this country. We see that women may have more money to buy products than they've ever had, but how are those products being sold to us? Is everyone included in the beauty standard? We are challenging those standards in every space that exists and that’s amazing because there are so many walls to break down and so many spaces to further liberate ourselves.    As we see #equalpayday show up on our timelines today let us remember they while Latina women are making 54 cents to the white male dollar, Native American women are making 57 cents to the white make dollar, Black women are making 63 cents to the white male dollar, white women are making 79 cents to the white male dollar, and Asian women are making 87 cents to the white male dollar...This is not just a gender issue, this is a race issue as well and as @gloriasteinem says, “the issues are linked not ranked” So while we have conversations today about the gender pay gap and, we cannot neglect the equally necessary conversations about race and inequity. We will never close the gap without looking at all of the reasons it exists.  Sending love to all my sisters out there working hard to parent, partner, nurture, and put food in the table. You are amazing. A post shared by  cleo wade (@cleowade) on Apr 10, 2018 at 2:01pm PDT  I suffer with really bad stage fright, which is really hilarious because I speak publicly for a living. I’m really sick with nervousness every time, whether it’s five people or 5,000 people. One of the mantras that I tell myself before an event is, “As long as you’re yourself you can’t fuck it up.”   A mantra for moving through this wild world. I love you.

			 Festive and super easy! It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa, and it’s *so* exciting! This year, to ensure your holidays are more focused on logging time at ugly sweater parties and not stressing over your to-do lists, try these simple, festive ways to live your best life this season, from cheap and easy decorating hacks to impossibly cozy clothes that make the season ten times brighter. Whether you’re still on campus or already home for winter break, take notes!  Forget the tree  While a big, decked-out Christmas tree is truly a sight to behold, it’s also a ton of work to set up. Plus, getting one will probably mean that you’ll still be finding pine needles in your pajamas until summer break — not ideal!  An alternative? Just throw a bunch of decorations on whatever plant you already have in your room. Think: mini ornaments for your cacti, some blue and silver tinsel for your Hanukkah ficus, and silver bells on that potted plant your grandma gave you that's somehow still alive. Whip up a treat that takes 30 seconds to make  Peppermint bark is ~easy~ to make, but it also looks super impressive. And, tbh, it’s way more exciting than cookies or brownies. Seriously, no matter how messy you are, it’s bound to look good.  Melt semi-sweet chocolate, pour it onto a sheet of wax paper, and let it dry. Then, melt white chocolate and layer it on top before sprinkling some crushed candy canes all over (you can also add sprinkles, dried cranberries, nuts… go crazy).  Once the chocolate sets, break it up into palm-sized shards and throw a few pieces of your homemade goodies into small clear plastic bags. Tie them off with ribbon and boom: You now have a cute lil’ holiday treat to give friends.  Prioritize staying cozy   Adulting doesn’t have to mean putting on jeans! Cute, matchy-matchy loungewear and outerwear will make you look put together for seeing friends and fam while you’re home for the holidays and still feel as comfy as humanly possible. Because, seriously, when is that ever not the goal? Victoria’s Secret PINK has the softest and cutest clothes — from sweats and sportswear to outerwear and pajamas — that'll keep you cozy and get you in the holiday spirit. A few favorites: 
 Victoria's Secret PINK Campus Cowl Neck in Luscious Plum, $49.95 SHOP NOW Victoria's Secret PINK High Waist Skinny Jogger, $54.95 SHOP NOW Victoria's Secret PINK Campus Cowl Neck in Pure Black, $49.95 SHOP NOW Victoria's Secret PINK Colorblock Fleece-Lined Leggings, $66.95 SHOP NOW The Campus Cowl Neck will keep you warm as an added layer over a long sleeved shirt or light sweater while boosting your spirit to an all-time high.  The High Waist Skinny Jogger is so — we repeat, SO — warm and comfy. Get them in every color because you'll go through withdrawal when they're in the wash. The Colorblock Fleece-Lined Leggings are stretchy, soft, and can be worn on a pre-dinner run or under a dress or sweater if your run just, um, slips your mind. And when in doubt, buy a gift card and let your friends and fam pick out whatever they want! You can't go wrong. DIY your holiday cards Because cards can be crazy expensive for some reason (seriously, I have better things to do with $6), why not make your own? Grab some of the note cards that you normally use for studying. On the lined side, tape or glue a picture of you and the friend you’re giving your personalized holiday postcard to, and on the blank side, write your message. Add stickers, glitter...you do you. Now, you not only have a super original card, but it can also double as a pic that your friend can display. You can get photos printed at a pharmacy, but if you don’t want to use a picture, fun holiday memes work too. Don’t stress your party outfit  If you actually have to get dressed up for a holiday party (and my sympathies), the easiest way to get a cool outfit with minimal effort is by throwing on a piece of statement jewelry. Big earrings or a standout necklace will do the trick. Everyone will be so distracted by your jewelry that you can get away with a simple LBD and minimal makeup.  Reuse party cups as holiday décor  Buying decorations is SO. MUCH. WORK. You likely have some red plastic cups lying around your dorm, so why not do something festive with them? If you’re feeling crafty, you can make a cup wreath. Glue the cups together in a circle, one inside the other, which will give you that wreath shape. Add a big bow to the bottom and voilà! Hang it on your door, and just like that your room is set for the holidays.

			 Cup sizes now go up to an H! In 2018, wine bottle pool floats can be ordered with one click, but finding a bra that fits? Well, that's whole different story. Thankfully ThirdLove is here to help make the world a better place for women of all chest sizes.  The trendy brand just announced that, along with offering half cup sizes, they are introducing 24 new sizes to their collection. The cups will range from AA through H and up to a 48-band size.  SHOP NOW 24/7 Perfect Coverage Bra, $68, thirdlove.com  With the new additions, ThirdLove now offers a total of 70 sizes — that’s more than double what some other popular bra competitors provide.  The brand's Chief Creative Office, Ra’el  Cohen, says the range in sizes lets women find a bra that truly fits instead of settling. "We  know  you  can’t  just  take  a  34B  and  scale  it up  to  a  40G — that’s  a  recipe  for  a  bad  fit. We’ve  worked  tirelessly  to  design  bras  that  don’t  just  scale  up  in  size,  but  that  have  additional  supportive  elements  that  are  nearly  unperceivable  to  the  naked  eye,"  she explained. The extended sizes are currently only available for the brand’s 24/7 Perfect Coverage Bra, but ThirdLove plans to expand to more designs, soon. If you're interested getting one, head over to ThirdLove’s Fit Finder to find your perfect size without having to leave your home.

			 I like big belts and I cannot lie. Have you noticed that belts are...changing? Until very recently we were all in on skinny ones, but now, that's over, and it's like, the bigger, the better. Celebs, influencers, and all your go-to online retailers are in on the situation, so if you are strongly opposed, IDK what you should do. BUT if you want to learn how to get back into the large belt groove (which you totally also rocked in middle school and high school), please scroll on ahead. Cold-weather coats are super warm, but they can be ridiculously shapeless. That's where your big-ass belt comes into play! Elsa Hosk and Bebe Rexha know what's up—check them out!    Make like these two and bring some shape to your MF-ing coat: 
 There are evening gowns, and then there are belted evening gowns. I know, it kinda sounds weird to add one to a formal floor-length design, but hear me out, or rather, hear Kendall Jenner and Kat Graham out:   Adding a larger accessory at the waist makes an already statement-making gown even more dramatic, when done the right way. Be the fanciest, most fashionable one at your next soiree: 
 Some printed styles out there today have a little too much going on. Wrapping a belt around the middle breaks up particularly loud ones and makes outfits that incorporate them a bit more polished. Lupita Nyong'o and Diane Kruger demonstrate here:   Cop these two's totally '80s realness right TF now: You know the feeling when you're wearing a cute (but admittedly plain) top and jeans and your outfit just doesn't have the wow-factor you want? That doesn't happen when  you pair that sh*t with a mega belt.   See what I mean? Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski's looks are totally memorable here. Sans belt, it's like, wait, what were they wearing again? Nail that low-key eye-poppin' belt sitch: 
 Sometimes you're wearing a killer dress and it looks great, but it's just, IDK, missing something. That's when you swoop in with a huge effing belt and steal the show, fam.   See? These looks on Chrissy Teigen, Bella Hadid, and Devon Windsor, which are def already pretty on their own, just got leveled way TF up by these belts. Join the off-duty model big belt-and-dress revolution: 
 Wait, you didn't think belts were just for dresses and pants, did you? You're missing a whole genre. That's right, a belt can really add pizzazz to your next skirt outfit.   These street style stars know what's up. They've taken some pretty great styles and upped the ante by adding funky belts to take their fashion from "Damn!" to "Dayummmm!" Learn to love the skirt-plus-belt combo: 
 Some lewks are already extra, so you may say, "What more could a large belt possibly add?" Lots. The answer is lots. Just take a look at these:   Somehow these OTT pieces don't get lost in these equally out-there styles and that's because belts go with everything. There's no getup that wouldn't be improved by a belt of some kind. So... "You get a belt! And you get a belt! And you get a belt!" —Oprah, probably Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 CROWN JEWELS ALERT!!! Ladies and gents, Meghan Markle's tiara has made its debut, and it is oh-so-sparkly. Kensington Palace confirmed via Twitter that she's wearing the Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara, putting an end to the speculation as to which tiara Markle would wear — or whether she'd even wear one at all. The tiara was made in 1932, and the entre brooch dates back to 1893. The veil is held in place by Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara, lent to Ms. Markle by The Queen. The diamond bandeau is English and was made in 1932, with the entre brooch dating from 1893. Here it is close-up! Queen Mary, wife of King George V, purchased the diamond bandeau from London jeweler Garrard in 1925, according to People. Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, inherited the tiara following Queen Mary's death, and Princess Margaret, also has worn the item. One tiara that definitely was out of the running was the Cartier Halo Tiara that Kate Middleton wore to her 2011 wedding to Prince William. Queen Elizabeth received the piece as an 18th-birthday present. It originally was made for the Queen Mother (a.k.a. Elizabeth of York) in 1936 and is set to appear in an exhibit at the National Gallery of Australia a few days after Meghan and Prince Harry's nuptials. Other possible selections from the royal vault included the Strathmore Rose Tiara, a romantic floral crown that the Queen Mother received from her parents on her wedding day; the Lotus Flower Tiara, which was made from a necklace King George VI gave the Queen Mother and is a part of the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe; and the Cartier Bandeau Tiara, an Art Deco design that also belonged to the Queen Mother. Other experts believed she would wear the Spencer Tiara, which Princess Diana wore when she wedded Prince Charles in 1981. This accessory belongs to the Spencer family; Di's brother, Charles, the Earl of Spencer, has it.   Follow Christina on Instagram.

			 It's also pretty dang cute.   Late one night, as I was scrolling through my Instagram feed before bed, I came across this post from buzzy fitness brand Outdoor Voices and my thumb stopped in its tracks.   "Holy shit, she ran a half marathon in a dress?!" I thought. "And, even better, it actually looks cute??!" While a workout dress is not necessarily new—there are a bunch of tennis dresses out there—this one seemed like it worked for SO many other activities, not just for swinging a racket.  Immediately intrigued, I looked it up on the brand's site, and discovered that it is appropriately dubbed, "The Exercise Dress." It not only has built-in spandex shorts, but it also comes in four other colors—red, green, black, and navy. (Judging from Instagram, however, the polkadot print seems to be the most popular.) While it was pretty and seemed functional from the photos...was it really? I decided to try it out for myself—here's what I found:   When I first felt the fabric, I was surprised at how thin it was, though it was definitely sturdy and capable of lots of stretch (which came in handy when I realized you have to step into the dress and pull the straps up over your shoulders).  The straps on the dress aren't adjustable, so if that's your thing, this design isn't for you. However, the straps are stretchy enough that they'll accommodate a wide range of fits, even if they're a little difficult to get on and off.  Once it was on, man, this thing fit so nicely. Amazingly, I didn't have to worry about flashing anyone with the built-in shorts, and the fact that they had a handy pocket for my phone made them that much better.  The first thing I did to give it a test drive was go to my local yoga studio. I admit it felt weird waltzing in there with a dress, but then I got into my ~flow~, and the dress moved with me through every sun salutation and warrior pose.  The only thing that made me feel slightly uncomfortable was the neckline—in certain moves where I would have to cross my arms, I was worried my cleavage (what little of it I have, anyway) was a bit more exposed than I liked it to be.  Quick FYI: The dress doesn't have a built-in bra, but from the reading the reviews, I was assured I didn't need one. (Although you could still opt for one if you like extra support!)  
  From my experience and from the other product reviews, it's great for low-impact workouts, running, and hiking. And while some people might be hesitant about the cost, you'll get double the wear out of it if you're the type of person who likes to go to brunch, run to the grocery store, or meet up with friends after a sweat sesh. Literally no one would know you just wore it to the gym unless they felt the fabric or you showed off the shorts underneath. Plus, it's just as trendy of an outfit when paired with a sweater if it's cooler outside.  The Takeaway In short, if your workouts aren't high-intensity and you're a gal on the go who likes to stay busy after hitting the gym, I definitely recommend it. If you're on board with the style, you can also shop similar silhouettes below to live your best workout-dress life.  lululemon.com $138.00 SHOP NOW Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Wait until you read these women's incredible stories.  On Thursday, Missguided is launching a new campaign, #InYourOwnSkin, which celebrates "what the industry perceives as 'flaws' or imperfections," the brand stated in a press release. The initiative features six women who have albinism, burn marks, skin conditions like Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) and psoriasis, freckles, tattoos, and birthmarks, and they make a powerful statement about perfection, self-love, and empowerment.    The campaign comes after Missguided's #MakeYourMark campaign last year, in which it announced it would stop airbrushing model's stretch marks. The campaign received positive reactions on social media and featured models of all sizes.  In a press release for the #InYourOwnSkin campaign, the brand wrote: "These women own it. They have attitude. They are proud of who they are. They inspire confidence. They want you to love your body (it's the only one you've got!)." And if you look at these photos, you can see just how accurate that is.  Isabella caught her shirt in a house fire when she was 17, but she hopes to normalize disabilities and disfigurements through modeling. "Beauty is the feeling of self-confidence," the college student said in a statement. Mariana was born with a birthmark on her face, but she has "learnt to love the way she looks and empowers others through body positivity on social media." She is a Brazilian model and fashion designer.  She sports so many little freckles on her face and body and also has tattoos covering her arms, legs, neck, and chest. What does body positivity mean to her? "Being 100 percent comfortable in yourself."  Beth, a college student who lives in Manchester, England, has psoriasis. The Missguided campaign happens to be her first modeling gig, and it's safe to say she crushed it.  Maya has Epidermolysis Bullosa, a rare skin condition which causes skin to blister easily and affects 500,000 people worldwide, according to the press release. She hopes to raise awareness of the condition through modeling. "I think we are on the way to empowering women a lot more than we used to," she says. Joanne has albinism and works to break boundaries that exist in the beauty and fashion industries with her skin disorder. "My role in life is not to be accepted by society," she says in the press release. "I live fearlessly, and I am unapologetically me."  The new campaign is the latest example of major retailers, such as Aerie, CVS, and ASOS, embracing body positivity, diversity, and un-retouched photos. Take one more moment to admire, yet again, just how incredible these women look. Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 All it takes is some Amazon shopping—and maybe a lil paint.  No one likes spending a bunch of money for one spooky night, right?? (Or maybe they do, IDK!) The point is, if you’re still trying to figure out your Halloween costume, there are so many ideas out there that don’t require a ton of work or cash. You can DIY them with smart shopping—or just using clothes already in your closet—and some makeup, cardboard, and a little creativity. You got this! If you want to make an effort but also save some serious $$$ (I get it, girl!), these ideas are proof that an amazing ensemble for the night is super easy to make yourself or even with your group of  friends! Here, 45 DIY costumes to get into the (crafty) Halloween spirit. Become a scarecrow by adding fake stitches to your face, braiding your hair, and wearing flannel and a straw hat. Now you look like you came straight out of a cornfield.  Channel this spunky TV character with her signature yellow beanie, pigtails, and leather jacket. You mostly likely already have these things, so consider your costume problem solved.  Why go as one person when you can go as a whole decade? Taraji P. Henson looked like a ’70s babe in flared jeans, oversize glasses, and a studded denim jacket.  Get a super-short (and super-pink) mini, some over-the-knee boots, and hike that ponytail real high to transform into the “thank u, next” singer.  The iconic doll is all about the color pink, so wear a pink skirt, white top, and leave your blonde hair (or wig) down. Throw on a bright lip and matching pink shoes. If you really wanna get crazy, construct your own Barbie box with cardboard and paint.  Just wear a white crop top and skirt, wrap some gauze over them, put on some dark makeup, and your costume is DONE.  A dramatic smoky eye, red lips, and a long-sleeve black dress with a slit makes you Morticia for the night. And if your S.O. wants in, all they need is a pinstripe suit and a pencil mustache made with eyeliner.  What do you get when you combine a plain pink tee, glow-in-the-dark paint, cargos, and a wig? Reggie, of course!  Another use for cargo pants? Dressing up like your fave cartoon spy. Pair them with a black crop top, gloves, black combat boots, and a red wig (if you don't already have red hair), and you can stop any crime.  Turn this party game into a costume with four easy steps. 1) Acquire black shirt. 2) Buy red Solo cups. 3) Hot-glue said cups on cardboard and then onto the shirt. 4) Use white fabric marker to write on it. Optional: Lie on the ground and become a human beer pong table.  Iron letters onto a short-sleeve tee, wear denim shorts, knee socks, boots, and beanies, and you'll be the cutest dwarf on Halloween.  One of the most iconic advertisement characters of our time. Get an apron, make some pins, rock a cat-eye and red lips, and you’re basically the embodiment of Flo.  Even if your eyeliner skills aren’t perfect, everyone can draw on whiskers and a nose. Then stick some Minnie ears on your head and wear something red with white polka dots, and everywhere you go on Halloween night will be the Happiest Place on Earth.  High pony? Check. A pink sweater over a pink button-down? Check. An A-line mini skirt? Check. Congrats, you’re now Betty Cooper! ’s costume might be even easier, because all you need is a denim jacket, plaid shirt around the waist, and an angsty attitude.  Break out your best black band tee, matching pants, and silver chain. Then buy a black wig to complete the rock ‘n’ roll lewk.  Pile on ALL the glitter (in your hair, on your face, on your body), wear your energy crystals, and plop a unicorn horn on your head to be the most magical creature on Halloween.  All you need for this are plain simple orange and bright green T-shirts with hems you cut in a zig-zag pattern. Then, using black felt fabric, cut out triangles in various sizes and attach them with a glue gun. If you’re Pebbles, add a white bow and matching leggings, and if you’re Bamm-Bamm, cut one shoulder off the shirt and wear a black T-shirt and leggings underneath.  For the ultimate mermaid look, pair a green sequined skirt with a plain purple top and a long red wig. If you want to go the whole nine yards, you can also get a purple bra and glue seashells on it for the full Ariel effect.  Buy cheap oversized T-shirts in green, pink, and blue, and wrap—or glue—black fabric around the middle to channel sugar, spice, and everything nice. Wear black leggings underneath with plain black shoes, and the look is so spot-on.  The ’80s classic starring Winona Ryder serves up so much fashion inspiration in the form of plaid blazers and jackets. You can easily recreate the high school clique movie with items you already own or cheap thrift store finds. Complete your jacket and skirt combo with knee-high socks and heels, and you too can be a Heather for the night.  If you're a fan of the game—or just want an easy costume to make—wear all black and cut out white dots and lines to create domino pieces.  All you need for this costume is a white button-down, a solid-color pencil skirt, heels, and a patterned bandana—you’re ready for takeoff.  Oversize T-shirts strike again, but this time you can make them into your fave mini chocolate candy by drawing a giant “M” on them. Style your hair in fun space buns using matching ribbons, put on white Converses, and you’ll be the cutest M&M anyone has ever seen.  Buy cheap white and blue felt, draw pixilated eyes, and cut them out. Hot-glue them to a bright shirt, sport some black leggings, and you’ll be SO prepared to take on Pac-Man himself.  Supplies needed for this spacy costume include a long-sleeve purple leotard, matching tutu, neon green ankle socks, a coordinating wig, puffy paint, and a headband. Combine them all together and you have one heck of a group costume.  Don a bright yellow midi dress and tap shoes and you’ll be the Emma Stone to someone’s Ryan Gosling on Halloween night. “City of Stars” will be stuck in everyone’s head in the best possible way.  Before the Unicorn Frappucino was even a thing, these two dressed up as the Starbucks Strawberry Cream Frappe. Follow their lead, then add an extra ~*unicorny*~ twist by tie-dying a white dress pink and blue, wearing a fluffy white scarf, and attaching a printed-off Starbucks logo to your stomach. Add extra authenticity by painting an empty paper towel roll green and attaching it to a headband with even more white fluff.   Get a pink or white dress, glue on colorful pom-pom “sprinkles,” and attach coordinating felt ears (with more sprinkles) to a headband. Delicious! Cut colorful construction paper into squares, and glue onto pieces of cardboard long enough to “censor” yourself. Then fasten them to a neutral dress and head out the door. Head to your local fabric store to stock up on tulle and sewing supplies. Bunch up the fabric and sew it together tightly to create the ultimate bath pouf. Wear a tube dress or a tank and shorts underneath. And after your pre-party shower, don’t forget to take your shampoo (and rubber ducky) with you!  Even Queen Bey has donned this classic (and cheap!) number. All you need to dress up as the feminist icon is a red bandanna, a chambray shirt, and 1940s-inspired makeup. Oh, and a toned bicep when you pose for your Instagram. Pair your fave sleeveless LBD with black heels, borrow a long strand of pearls if you don’t already have one, and top the outfit with little purchases from a costume store: tiara, cigarette holder, and long black gloves.   Purchase or make a white tutu and wear a pink tank. Trade in Carrie’s Manolo Blahniks for any shoe in your closet—and be sure to order a Cosmo at the bar.  Lauren Conrad and crew make this costume look expensive (note the bubbly), but you can make it for no money at all! Wear a dress—long or short, doesn’t matter—with a set of animal ears like Conrad, or dress up as an animal and wear a party hat on top. It goes both ways! From your closet, pull a white button-down, long-sleeve black dress, and black tights. Braid your hair into two pigtails for the full Addams effect.  This costume requires a quick trip to your local fabric store to purchase stuffing, pink or blue spray paint, and a hot-glue gun. Grab construction paper and a headband, then follow this free tutorial. You most likely already own these comfy clothes: boxer shorts, a button-down, and high white socks. This costume is ~literally~ priceless—because it doesn’t cost a thing.  Grab a pink skirt, white shirt, and give yourself 10 minutes to cut the word “chill” out of paper and tape it to your clothes. Talk about chill...and cheap! Prove those Halloween stores wrong and be sexy AF without dropping a cent on a costume. With a tight black top, tight black pants, and slinky heels, you can easily become Sandy from Grease. Throw on a pair of light-wash jeans or overalls, your favorite fall flannel, and boots. All you'll need to buy is face paint (because, seriously, who has that lying around?) and a wide-brimmed hat or straw hat.  White tank with boob holes + purple tank layered beneath with a black skirt = a timeless costume.  Either paint red stripes onto an old tee or buy an inexpensive red-and-white shirt from a nearby store. For a little more money, you can purchase fake glasses and binoculars from a costume store, but why not paint them on? If you're not in the dress-up spirit, no worries. Just put on your favorite outfit, grab a piece of paper or cardboard from the recycling, and write the words, “Nudist on strike.” Pair your finest white ensemble with inexpensive fairy wings and a wand you get at a costume store. Then, glue a cutout of a tooth to the top of the wand. Need I say more?

			 It’s. So. Fluffy. Fall is officially here, which means it’s time to order a Pumpkin Spice Latte, schedule an apple-picking adventure, and trade in your summer clothes for some fresh fall pieces. Currently, Amazon has you covered and is offering a dreamy, oh-so-cozy fleece for less than $30.    Made from under-the-radar company Comeon, this top-rated fleece is super similar to Thread & Supply’s cozy Wubby fleece. The polyester jacket has a soft, teddy-bear-like texture that is cozy but won’t irritate your skin. The full zipper makes it easy to take on and off as the temperature fluctuates, and the plush collar will keep your neck warm. (Translation: Your mom will approve.)  Just because this jacket prioritizes comfort doesn’t mean it skimps on style. Available in a handful of colors—ranging from a bright cherry red to camel—this fleece can be a great finishing touch to plenty of fall outfits. For a casual look, it can be thrown over your workout clothes. When you’re heading to work, pair it with wide trousers and some white sneakers. Or for something edgier, this jacket will soften a pair of tough Chelsea boots and ripped jeans.   Sure, you may not wear this jacket right now, but we recommend adding this to your cart stat. As they say in Winterfell, winter is coming.

			 The weddings might have been fictional, but the gowns are still GORGEOUS.  Although the ceremonies weren't real (no matter how much you wanted them to be), you can still appreciate the gowns your favorite fictional characters wore on their wedding days. These 34 leading ladies will give you major wedding dress inspo for your own big day. Rachel Zane (played by Meghan Markle, obvi) wore a V-neck dress with a fitted waist and floral appliqués in the season 7 finale when she (finally!) marries Mike Ross. The dress, designed by Anne Barge, was vastly different from Meghan's IRL wedding gown, which was an off-the-shoulder style with three-quarter length sleeves.  In true Liz Lemon fashion, she wore a Star Wars get-up, including hair buns that would make Princess Leia proud, to wed Criss Chros in season 7. Apparently, it was the only white dress she had.   SPOILER ALERT: In the series finale of The Mindy Project, Tamra and Morgan finally tie the knot. She wears a stunning off-the-shoulder lace gown with a veil attached to her gorgeous braids.  In season 4, Rayna James exchanged vows with Deacon Claybourne wearing an off-the-shoulder wedding dress with lace and had her hair swept to one side.  The Fresh Prince was set to abandon his womanizing ways by nearly marrying Lisa in season 5, although the wedding never happened. Although the couple agreed to call it quits, Lisa still looked gorgeous in an off-the-shoulder wedding dress with textured fabric and floral details.  Becky and Jesse were a couple just meant to be on Full House – Jesse was the motorcycle jacket-wearing ladies' man while Becky was the put-together news show host. The pair tied the knot in season 4, when Becky wore this off-the-shoulder puff-sleeve gown.  Cristina married fellow doctor Owen Hunt in season 7 of Grey's Anatomy wearing a deep red wedding dress. It featured a plunging V neckline and perfectly matched her bouquet.  Grace walked down the aisle in season 5 to marry her boyfriend of two months, Leo, wearing a strapless gown with an elegant veil. And, in a very fitting gesture, her BFF Will walked her down the aisle.  Monica and Chandler finally tied the knot in season 7 of Friends, and Monica wore this plunging V-neck dress with a trumpet skirt and a long veil. The episode in which they try to write down their wedding vows for the big day showed so many adorable flashback scenes of their relationship, it was hard not to ugly sob.  Jasmine married Crosby in the season 3 finale of Parenthood  in a pretty outside ceremony complete with twinkling string lights. The bride wore a floral headband over her loose waves and chose a white wrap dress for the big day.  Jim and Pam were the couple you were rooting for on The Office. Their flirty co-worker relationship moved into dating territory, resulting in a romantic but unplanned gas station proposal, and culminating in the couple's Niagara Falls wedding in season 6. Pam wore this spaghetti-strap dress with a sweetheart neckline, a rhinestone necklace, and a short veil for the occasion. Viewers were dying to see who Jane would end up with in the beginning of the show — Rafael or Michael — but in the end she walked down the aisle to marry Michael in the season 2 finale. She wore a lace boatneck gown, pinning her hair in an elegant updo.  High-school sweethearts Kelly and Zack married in a beautiful outdoor wedding in Las Vegas. She wore a scoop-neck wedding dress with sleeves and a veil tucked into her short hair. The nups took place during the series finale of Saved by the Bell: The College Years.  No, the Liars didn't get married — they were just modeling dresses for a charity fashion show in season 4. But each look perfectly reflected each character's personality, from Spencer's classic, no-fuss number to Emily's romantic, show-stopping lace gown with cap sleeves.  Cory and Topanga seemed destined for each other when they met in Mr. Feeney's classroom in season 1, when Topanga first kissed him. They tied the knot in season 7, and she wore a lacy, long-sleeve, off-the-shoulder gown with a train.  Phoebe and Mike married in season 10, right outside of Central Perk, in the snow. She wore a strapless dress with a fitted bodice and draping in the skirt.  The General Hospital episode featuring Luke and Laura's ceremony drew more viewers than Princess Diana's televised wedding to Prince Charles. For a fictional wedding this spectacular, Laura wore an ornate headpiece with lace and tulle veiling, a Victorian era-looking wedding dress with buttoned sleeves, and puffy shoulders – very fitting for the '80s.   Blair was the Queen B in Gossip Girl when it came to drama and fashion, so it's no surprise that she went with an unexpected, yet still elegant, wedding dress by Elie Saab. Chuck and Blair had a beautiful Central Park ceremony in the series finale, and this gorgeous gown was definitely her "something blue."  Following in B's footsteps, Serena also got hitched to none other than Dan, who was revealed as the show's titular character in the series finale. She opted for a strapless gold, metallic, and white tulle dress from designer Georges Chakra in the final episode. After an on-again, off-again relationship, Miranda and Steve finally married in season 6. For the occasion, Miranda bucked convention by opting for a red velvet wedding dress. In a twist of  irony, in season 6, Charlotte ended up marrying Harry Goldenblatt, the lawyer who handled her divorce from her first husband, Trey MacDougal. She wore a cold-shoulder gown (very on-trend, even now) with ribbons criss-crossing the bodice. She topped the look with a veil tucked into the back of her curls.  Robin wore a sheer Monique Lhuillier dress with three-quarter length sleeves, a mermaid skirt, and a crystal belt for added sparkle. She wore the gown for her season 9 wedding to Barney.  Although she ran away from her wedding, Rachel wearing her dress on the Central Perk sofa was an iconic moment from the sitcom's pilot episode. Her off-the-shoulder dress with lace applique was surprisingly chic, and she accessorized with a three-strand pearl necklace, a headband, and a tulle veil. The now-infamous dress was actually Warner Bros. stock from the costume department. Cece and Schmidt had a complicated on-and-off again relationship, but they finally turned it back on when they married in the two-part season 5 finale. She wore a gold sari complete with red and white flowers, while Schmidt matched the color scheme with a tan suit and a red tie.  Meredith opted for an embellished dress with thin straps and a flared skirt by Kenneth Pool to marry Derek Shepard. The two doctors wed in season 5.  Leslie and Ben didn't get along at first, but isn't that how all great relationships start? The two married, fittingly, at the Parks Department office during season 5, and Leslie wore a short pleated dress made from lace, tulle, newspaper clippings, and documents of all of her biggest victories from the show.  Although Laura and Hakeem Lyon didn't end up marrying in season 2 (spoiler alert, sorry!), the bride still looked flawless with her veil pulled over her dress, which featured see-through lace detail.  In a season 6 episode titled "The Perfect Dress," Lorelei attempts to find just that for her upcoming wedding to Luke. She goes dress shopping with Sookie and comes across the perfect blush satin dress with a flowered bodice — which also happened to be on sale! For those Fitz fans out there in the Scandal universe, this was probably a heartbreaking scene. This wedding sequence from season 6 aired as a "what if" moment in which audiences saw what his marriage to Olivia could have looked like. In it, Olivia wore a shoulder-baring gown with a dramatic silk skirt, and her hair pulled back in an elegant rhinestone-embellished bun.  Jessa was definitely the wild card on Girls – she e-mailed Hannah, Shoshanna, and Marnie to meet her for a secret party in season 1, and it ended up being her surprise wedding to Thomas-John. Known for her bohemian fashion choices, she went with this short dress with billowy sleeves and a flowery headband for her big day.

			 These supplies might actually get you excited for homework. I know it's summer and you probably don't want to think about heading back to school. But, whether you're starting high school or college in the fall or you're already getting a head start and taking summer classes (major kudos to you), Amazon has you covered. Here, 16 items that will get you SO ready – and maybe even a little excited – for a new school year.  If a bland, solid-colored backpack isn't for you, opt for one with bold stripes as a fun way to hold all your boring ol' textbooks.  A pair of Bluetooth headphones that are portable with a fold-up feature are ideal for when you want to tune out the world and focus on writing that thesis paper.  If you're that one friend who always has their camera ready, a light, portable GoPro is an easy way to film and take pics for every football game and road trip so you can look back on the memories with your best buds.  Whether you're into crafts or just really love Sharpies, a colorful 24-count pack will last you all four years of high school and/or college because, hey, even if you lose one, you still have 23.  Two pen-holders for the price of one is a deal that can't be beat, and you'll have no excuse for constantly losing your writing utensils because you have a convenient area to store them.  If caffeine gets you through all your study sessions, invest in getting a coffee machine so you can have a cup right when you roll out of bed.  A shelf that fits snugly in a metal locker but also doubles as a stand you can put on your desk is priceless.  A Bluetooth speaker is a great investment that will last you a LONG time, whether you're hosting a get-together, or just really like blasting your music. Make your room more cozy with a super-soft throw you'll want to curl up in after attending a 7 a.m. lecture or taking a midterm exam.  Dorms don't typically have a lot of personality, but with a simple glass prism, you can totally transform your space by putting candles in it or making it a home for succulents.  You can never have enough space for all your books, and a sturdy floating shelf will keep your books off the floor, at least. Brighten up any room with a multi-colored floral duvet cover that will make your space feel truly unique.  Use a mini Polaroid to create a personal scrapbook of all the good times you'll have this school year.  An over-the-door shoe holder is a college essential, and because of the transparent sleeves, it's so easy to see which pair to pick out.  If you're lost without writing down your schedule each day, a yearly planner will help you keep up with deadlines, upcoming tests, extracurriculars, and more.   Want a simple way to spruce up your dorm? Opt for a minimal, but oh-so-cute pineapple lamp to add extra light and a chic flair to your space.

			 Not everyone’s a bralette person, and that’s totally okay!  In the past couple years, bralettes have seemingly taken over the bra industry, but there’s no shame at all in wearing styles that give you a little extra somethin’.

Here, we’ve rounded up the top-rated push-up bras that the internet has to offer in a variety of styles and cup sizes, so your boobs can feel supported—and you can show off some major cleavage if that’s what you’re into.            *Reviews were edited and condensed for clarity.

			 Boot season = best season.  It’s already September (don’t ask me how that happened!), so it’s time to start gearing up for the fall season. And when the cold weather is imminent, there’s the need to buy cute new boots, of course—especially if your old ones are beyond repair and have, like, weird salt stains on them. Whether you’re in the market for a more practical pair that’ll hold up in outdoorsy activities or a more stylish pair that will dress up any ’fit (or both), you’re guaranteed to find the perfect fall boots with these 25 styles. Just imagine yourself hiking, drinking a PSL, jumping into a pile of leaves, or picking out a Halloween pumpkin wearing any of ’em.  Lil silver studs along the trio of buckles adds a touch of edge to these booties.  The corduroy material on these booties makes them stand out from the rest of your fall shoes, and the neutral hue means you can easily wear them with any other color.  Suede boots and fall go together like hot chocolate and marshmallows, and a pair that is two-toned puts a twist on regular ol’ ones.  Great news for your toes: Kitten heels are in! That means you can walk all day in a pair of burgundy boots without suffering from sore feet.  Don’t want to be boxed into just one type of shoe? Get yourself a pair of “shoeboots,” i.e., this croc-embossed skin pair. The design is ideal for transitioning weather, thanks to its openings at the toe and heel.  If you’re not a fan of plain boots, a short neutral pair with embroidered details is right up your alley.  The shine of patent leather boots is definitely eye-catching, and you’ll get so many compliments on these—especially with the edgy wide heel.  Give your pair a sexy spin in a fire-engine-red shade and a stiletto for extra drama. The heel is on the shorter side so you won’t have trouble walking, and the zipper makes them so easy to pull off.  Go for a ’70s-inspired variation with a pair that has a platform. These babies would look incredible with a floral boho dress and shearling coat to complete the retro look.  Investing in a more practical pair of boots that’ll last through any hiking treks—no matter the difficulty—is definitely a good idea. This Danner pair is a classic silhouette and looks just as cute off the trails too.  Give your toes and heels some air with boots that have extra openings. Shoes with these details are great because they’ll prevent your feet from overheating and sweating if that crisp fall weather hasn’t quite hit yet. Love a traditional lace-up boot? Get yourself a dark brown pair with a comfortable heel that you know you’ll wear 24/7 once cold weather hits.  Who knew that with a little glitter, sock boots could be so chic? These babies will become your new best friends because they’re easy to slide on but stylish enough for your dressiest fall occasions.  It’s always an exciting time of year when you can wear tall boots again, so invest in a classic brown leather pair that you’ll wear again and again.  Do your feet feel claustrophobic in boots? This backless design solves that problem, and it even has a cute wrap-around buckle detail to keep your foot in place.  Suede over-the-knees are a classic style and happen to make your legs Look. Miles. Long. (Even more so when paired with a minidress or -skirt.) In a sea of black and brown shoes during the season, make sure yours stand out by wearing deep red. According to reviewers, this pair fits like a glove—just make sure to size up! Blundstone boots are a cult favorite for a reason: They’re durable and water-resistant, and they feel practically indestructible. The pull tabs on both the front and back help your feet slide in, and thanks to the Chelsea silhouette and black hue, they’re super versatile. Your boots will look so amazing in a gorgeous amber shade, and they’ll look even more luxe in velvet.  Western fashion is having a moment, but if you don’t want to go all out with cowboy boots, try this shorter version instead. The contrast stitching channels the aesthetic, but the silhouette is still sleek.  A pair of faux-snakeskin boots will make your feet feel so cool, while the multicolor pattern differentiates them from all the plain black ones you probably already own.  A utilitarian combat boot gives you the best of both worlds—it is comfortable and also has a heel to make your outfit dressy.  Chelsea boots are an essential for fall, but a pair with black leather and a brown sole goes with twice the colors in your wardrobe.  Get yourself a pair of boots that have an angled block heel this season—it’s an an unexpected twist on a classic shape.  Treat yourself to a pair of *wild* ankle boots that also have tons of stretch for an easy on and off.

Christmas lingerie doesn't have to be quite so literal. Go for a sultry, yet subtle nod to the season in a maroon slip dress with a very steamy hip-high slit. If you feel like a hood is what your Christmas lingerie life has been missing, look no further than this bodysuit situation which includes a fun white trim and down-to-there neckline. Three words: Sheer. Lace. Bodysuit. In case a sexy little dress is what you need, a halter-neck option with white fuzzy trim will do the trick. If burgundy is more up your alley than bright red, consider this deeper-hued set that features a bra, a skirt, and even cuffs in a rich, velvety fabric.

			 Bows! Straps! Lace!   Whether your friend is a bride-to-be and you’re headed to an epic bachelorette or you wanna give her lingerie just because (why not?!), there’s a sexy set out there for them that’s waiting to be worn.  They deserve to feel amazing and confident on their wedding day—and every day, duh—so treat her to some steamy pieces that’ll definitely become her new favorite underpinnings. Here, 20 lingerie gifts that’ll make them feel sexy, sweet, and everything in between.  A slinky slip with lace details is a chic yet sexy gift for a bride-to-be...or really any friend who loves sleeping in soft nightgowns. A two-piece set with see-through fabric is modest from the front but saucy from the back. A delicate bodysuit with scalloped edges is super cute, and it’s perfect for a friend who likes surprising back details. (Hint: There are a lot of straps back there.) A matching set with contrasting black straps and a cheeky garter belt attached will be right up her alley if she wants something more unique. Plus, this comes in four other shades. A lacy see-through teddy in this gorgeous jewel tone is great for fall, and the backless design shows more skin. A more low-key lingerie look is never a bad thing! A floral print on a navy background adds some color, but the silhouette is practical for everyday wear too. (The matching underwear is sheer in the back for a *cheeky* flair, FYI.) Lacy trim on shorts and a panel on the cami give an otherwise simple pj set a whole new look. Triangle bras don’t offer much support, but if you’re small-chested (*raises hand*), then it’s not that big of a con. This gorgeous amethyst shade will stand out on any skin tone, and it looks even better with the matching bow bottoms. A bodysuit that features both lace and mesh is definitely a special present. It has easy-to-reach adjustable straps and even a cutout at the back. Do they need a little support? Get them an underwire style that’s made of super-soft stretch lace and features dainty cutouts at the top to reveal just the tiniest bit of skin. The wide band on the underwear is supportive and fits to their hips too. A bralette with a longline silhouette adds more coverage, while the delicate straps make it subtly sexy. Also, the slightly high-waisted briefs will be so comfy. A plain white set can be a little snoozy, but a pattern and tiny bows on the straps add extra oomph. Your friend will love the fit—and you’ll love the price. Balconettes are where it’s at for a subtly sexy lingerie look that they can still wear casually under a T-shirt. This midnight hue is so pretty, especially when paired with the coordinating underwear. If they want to commit to an OTT lingerie getup, look no further than this super-strappy black set. The high-waisted underwear happens to be pretty breezy in the back, too, if ya know what I mean. Mesh with tiny lil stars on it makes for a playful ensemble, and the metallic shapes add more interest to an otherwise minimal black number. This babydoll comes with a matching thong, so they can wear the pieces together on a special night. Oh la la! Sometimes a girl needs more fabric, and that’s totally okay! This purple balconette offers more coverage than others but still has pretty fabric. Also, the range of cup sizes (A-I) offered is damn impressive. This bra turns into a racerback if your friend needs options, and it comes in pink and blue too. The high-waisted briefs also have sheer panels for an extra-sexy detail. The emerald-green hue mixed with black straps makes this a standout set. Plus, it has underwire for added support. This teddy is all sorts of amazing with its cutouts, bows, open cups, and daring open gusset.

			 The Marchesa designer hasn’t gone out in five months, and has forged a friendship with Huma Abedin. Though she didn't dress up like the Pope, like Rihanna did, Scarlett Johansson still caused some controversy with her Met Gala gown on Monday night. That's because she decided to wear a dress from Marchesa, and one-half of that designer duo, Georgina Chapman, is the ex-wife of Harvey Weinstein.  It was the first time a major star had worn Marchesa on the red carpet since Weinstein became the center of a sexual misconduct scandal. And Chapman herself had remained silent — until now. To recap: Since October, more than 50 women have come forward with allegations against Weinstein; the allegations include sexual assault, harassment, and unwanted advancement over the past three decades. In a response to a New Yorker article on the matter, Weinstein’s spokesperson noted, “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.” Shortly after the allegations became public, Chapman announced she was leaving Weinstein, and back in January they agreed on a divorce settlement, according to People. In a new interview with Vogue, Chapman reveals what her life has been like since the scandal, from getting therapy to striking up a friendship with Huma Abedin, whose ex-husband is disgraced politician Anthony Weiner. Here are some of the biggest takeaways from Chapman’s first return to public life. When asked whether she was ever suspicious of Weinstein, Chapman responded, “Absolutely not. Never.” She said that their marriage was a happy one, with Weinstein giving her confidence and being a great father to their children (India, 7, and Dashiell, 5). “There was a part of me that was terribly naive—clearly, so naive. I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief!” she said. “I don’t know. I wish I had the answers. But I don’t.” Chapman told Vogue that she hasn't felt right going out in public since the scandal hit. “I was so humiliated and so broken...that...I, I, I...didn’t think it was respectful to go out,” she said. “I thought, Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It’s still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.” Chapman said she’s been seeing a therapist, and it’s clear from the interview she still has a lot to emotionally process, especially as a mother to their two children. “I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be?” she said, through tears. “It’s like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can’t bear it for them!” It’s easy to presume that after the Weinstein scandal hit the news, celebrities would steer clear from wearing clothing made by his wife. In the past, Chapman’s friend Neil Gaiman admitted, Weinstein would sometimes push actresses to wear Marchesa on the red carpet.  But Chapman insisted that the decision to scale things back post-scandal was hers. “We didn’t feel it was appropriate given the situation. All the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It’s a time for mourning, really,” she said. “A lot of people reached out and said, ‘Let me wear something.’” And post-Met gala, perhaps they'll get to.  A few months before Weinstein’s scandal broke, Chapman met Huma Abedin, the now-ex wife of Anthony Weiner. Abedin, who rarely gives interviews, spoke to Vogue about how the two grew closer, bonding over their husbands’ scandals. “We just...bonded. In allll kinds of ways,” Abedin said. “This particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me. People don’t feel sorry for us; you don’t get that empathy.”

			 Srsly the best purchase I’ve made this summer.   
  On an *especially* windy day here in New York City, I was on 11th Avenue, clutching the hem of my minidress, frantically trying to avoid a not-so-cute Marilyn Monroe moment. Then I spotted my refuge: the Hudson Yards mall, which I knew had a Madewell store inside. I wandered in there to buy shorts I could wear underneath—because, yeah, if you couldn’t tell, I’m not suuuper fond of flashing people?—but this necessary impulse buy ended up being the Holy Grail pair.   Before this purchase, I had settled for pairs that didn’t fit right around my waist, were too short, or majorly stretched out. (Kinda ashamed to admit it, but until last year, most of the pairs I owned were still from high school, so yeah, that was definitely a contributing factor.) But I didn’t even know how subpar my other shorts were until my booty was in THESE. I was drawn to the medium wash and the length, and when I went to try them on in the dressing room, I completely fell in love with the snug fit (they hug your body without feeling like they’re digging in), the stretchy fabric (it makes your butt look amazing), and the fact that they hit right at my belly button (I stan a high-rise waistline, folks!). While they were cuffed when I saw them displayed, the hem isn’t stitched to the sides, so you can roll them down to make ’em an inch longer—but you can obviously choose to keep them cuffed if you’d rather.  And while they have ample stretch, they also don’t bag out after wearing them. In summers past, I could only get one good wear out of my other shorts because the waistline would stretch out so quickly. The gape I was left with at the end of the day didn’t just look bad—it felt downright uncomfy. I’ve worn the Madewell pair throughout a whole weekend, and the waistband truly stayed the same size. It’s kind of a miracle, and now I have my eyes on the black pair too.  They can run a little large. I’m normally a size 25 or 26 in jeans, depending on the brand and/or cut, but a size 24 fit me. So just keep that in mind when ordering online, or if you prefer a slightly looser fit, then go with your normal size. But once you do find your size (they range from 23 to 32!!!), you’ll be ALL about these denim shorts.

			 Hot damn.    Kylie Jenner was largely absent from social media when she was pregnant with Stormi, but after she gave birth in February, she's been back to her usual OTT OOTD Instagram pics. One of them included this brown velvet onesie that she posted on Wednesday, complete with tiny sunglasses and a Fendi bag that I'm assuming is from her giant purse closet.  In the caption, Jenner  also wrote that her matte lip color is "Dolce K" from her namesake beauty brand — "just in case you were wondering." But really, with everything else going on in this photo, her lip color was definitely the last thing I was wondering about. Because just when I was getting over my awe about how she could pull off a solid brown zip-up onesie, she posted THIS:  You know how everyone posts the peach emoji because it looks like an amazing, well-sculpted butt? This photo deserves a MILLION peach emojis. And her caption game — "hump day" — was on point. Plus, her Fendi bag is sitting on the hood of her Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon in the background, and if that isn't the most luxe thing you've ever seen, I don't know what is. Consider this Kylie's "hump day treat" to the Internet.

			 I’m hyperventilating, HBU?! In amazing shoe nostalgia news, Steve Madden has brought back his “Slinky” platform sandals with an exclusive capsule collection for Urban Outfitters. The iconic style first debuted in 1994, so for all you millennials out there (so also me, lol), this is basically a dream come true. “Since the very beginning, it’s been all about platforms for us,” Madden said in a press release. “We figured now was the best time to reinvent these styles.” The Slinky designs, which retail for $70, come in hot pink, bright lime, and black, while the platform thong sandals, which retail for $60, come in black, orange, and a multicolor silver. Also, you’ll gain, like, three inches wearing these bad boys, thanks to their chunky foam and rubber soles.  But if you’ve been keeping up with what’s *hot* this season, the news comes as no surprise because ’90s trends have definitely been recirculating in fashion lately. Bucket hats, tie-dye patterns, and hair clips are EVERYWHERE (I mean, have you seen all the Coachella Instagram pics from last weekend?!), so now the platforms you cherished in middle school are yet another addition to the styles making a major comeback.  
  Shop the shoes below for all the throwback feels—and so you can sport them this summer.

			 Because rose gold ears are so 2017. Move over rose gold Minnie ears. Hot pink cherry blossom ears are here and are selling out fast at Tokyo Disney. The brand-new sequined Minnie ears were released on March 1 at both Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea to celebrate the start of cherry blossom season—or sakura as it’s called in Japan. While the cherry blossom ears have the same bow and sequins, the pink color is much brighter than the pale pink rose gold version that went viral last year in America. If you're lucky enough to get your hands on a pair, the most popular way to pose with these on Instagram so far appears to be holding on to your cherry blossom ears, finding a pastel-colored wall and getting a snap from behind. Better yet, get matching pairs with three of your friends to recreate this colorful grid. The cherry blossom ears aren’t the only hot pink merch being sold at Tokyo Disney right now. In addition to the ears, iridescent mouse ear backpacks are also on sale right now. Plus, there’s fuzzy pink monsters purses and a pink satin bomber jacket with Tigger’s face embroidered on it that would really complete the whole lewk. If a trip to Tokyo is out of the question, don't worry. The cherry blossom ears are on sale for $32.71 on eBay from a user with 100% positive feedback who lives near the park.

			 She's truly a heavenly body. The 2018 Met Gala's theme is "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination" and, boy, did Katy Perry ever come through with a literal interpretation. See? She's basically an angel, except for the gold thigh-high boots and mini dress.   Also, mere earthly vehicles of transportation could NOT contain her fierce, heavenly wings. Quick question, though: Are those wings meant to stay on during the whole night? Like does she have to wear them into the bathroom and throughout dinner and everywhere in between? Just saying, that would get heavy after a while. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 But that's just one aspect of this incredibly hot outfit. Last night, Blake Lively showed up to a Lionsgate presentation at CinemaCon in Las Vegas and made a very strong case for the tuxedo dress. Please, see for yourself:   Let's scroll down this look, shall we? At the top of the outfit, Blake wore a very colorful bowtie, which was quite eye-catching, and a classic white button-down. Over all of that was the tux dress, which was navy blue with satin lapels. Then, about a mile down from there (because those legs are killer), Blake rounded out the whole ensemble with a pair of rainbow paint-splattered heels. Now that we've gone through the whole outfit, let's see another angle: I have to admit, the tie really threw me off here — the orange and green was a little unexpected. But maybe it's growing on me now? IDK!! Either way, there's no denying she looks generally sexy/radiant/amazing/gorgeous in this dress.  Into Blake's menswear-inspired style? Shop more like it — in multiple colors — below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 The Duchess is teaching a lesson in necklines.  Since announcing her engagement to Prince Harry last November, Meghan Markle has become a style icon and given the world plenty of trends to talk about. Take, for example, her fierce advocation for the underrated messy bun. She's a rule-breaker, but in a way that makes people say "Wait, lol, what rules?"  In the nine months since she officially started her journey to become a duchess, one neckline in particular seems to have become a default Meghan look: the boatneck, or bateau neckline. Glamour reports that since she and Harry got engaged, Pinterest noticed a 104 percent jump in saves for the style, and searches on eBay for bateau-neck tops and dresses have jumped 830 percent.  One of Meghan Markle’s low-key superpowers is looking good in boat necks Originally popularized by Chanel's founder Coco Chanel, Meghan chose to wear this style on the one day she knew the entire world would be watching — her wedding day. Her dress was a custom Givenchy designed by Clare Waight Keller.  But she's worn it multiple times before and after. Here, a short history of her relationship with the ever-classic bateau.  She wore this jacket in Cardiff, Wales on January 18 for one of her pre-wedding engagements. She paired the Theory coat with black skinny jeans and suede ankle boots. This print is called Prince Wales check, coincidentally, and it's a favorite of Kate Middleton's as well.    The next time she wore the style wasn't until four months later on the night before her wedding, May 18. She wore this navy Roland Mouret dress when she arrived at Cliveden House with her mother to get her beauty sleep before, arguably, one of the most important days of her life (no pressure!). The neckline is almost a combo of boatneck and asymmetrical necklines, but the general idea is the same.  And, of course, the boatneck to end all boatnecks: her wedding dress. She wore this on May 19, in case that date isn't burned into your brain!  If you need a second to stare at those pictures and remember how MAGICAL that day was, take your time.  Okay, moving on, the post-wedding bateaus! You could argue the first time she wore one post-nuptials was at the Trooping the Colour on June 9. If you wanna get ~technical~ about it, this is probably closer to an off-the-shoulder situation, but we're not here to be technical AND it's pretty, so there. This dress is by Carolina Herrera.   After that, she wore a lavender Prada two-piece skirt-suit to attend the Queens Young Leaders Awards on June 26 with Queen Elizabeth and Prince Harry.  Then, she wore a STUNNING canary yellow Brandon Maxwell dress on July 5. She was a literal ray of sunshine.  The yellow was fun, but so was this olive green Ralph Lauren number she wore to Prince Louis's christening on July 9. She paired it with a matching olive fascinator, shoes, AND gloves. That's commitment.  Next up, this navy blue Dior she wore on July 10. If it's giving you major déjà vu, it's probably because it looks really, really similar to her wedding gown, but with a shorter cut and not in white, obviously. Still beautiful!   Less than 24 hours later she wore another one. This is Roland Mouret, and if you compare it to the navy Roland Mouret she wore the night before her wedding, the dresses are strikingly similar (in a good way, obvs). She wore this during her first international tour on July 12 with Prince Harry. They were in Ireland.  There you have it! That's every single one of the nine times Meghan has bared a sliver of clavicle for the sake of fashun. Considering bare shoulders are a breach of royal protocol, here's hoping Meghan keeps up her rebellious streak.  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 Awww, you shouldn’t have! It’s true! Your mom is the best mom on the planet, which is obviously why you have to shower her with love, affection, and, oh yes, gifts during the holiday season. Yes, there are tons of presents to buy for people ranging from your boss to your teen brother and all your besties, but your mom’s gifts really deserve as much of your attention and thought as possible. Show her how much you care with these stylish, practical ideas she’ll absolutely adore. Scroll on for 38 great ideas and get ready for all the “happy tears” that are sure to follow. Upgrade her old tennis shoes with an on-trend pair of kicks that are still comfortable for everyday wear. Okay, but who could resist this adorable honey pot shaped like a bear with pretty polka dots on the outside?? I mean, who could resist these pretty croc-effect boots in a soft shade of blue? They’ll be the unexpected twist that takes all her outfits from great to WOW. A super-delicate yet statement-making stackable ring is a great everyday piece she can wear to spice things up a bit without going overboard. Liven up her living room with this very snuggly, very warm faux-fur throw. In winter, pretty much nothing matters except your outerwear. If that’s fashionable, you’re good! So this cute animal-print beret will be much appreciated for its warmth and style. A simple yet statement-making card case will help her easily transition among all kinds of purses. Does she love to sparkle? Then this gold and shimmer makeup kit by Tom Ford will be the perfect gift. If your mom’s the professional type, you could seriously upgrade her work style with this fun multi-print skirt.  These gold earrings will bring up the drama in any of her outfits, because they go with absolutely anything. She’ll never want to take off this matching sleepwear this winter, I promise. If mom likes to experiment with fun new looks, consider this cool leather bucket bag that’ll get her all the compliments. These two-tone sunnies will go perfectly with that vacation she’s got planned later this year. This handy doodad will take the sulfates out of her wine and aerate it—win-win! She’ll love wrapping herself up in this blanket scarf with simple fringe trim. Any mom wearing this choker piece will instantly upgrade their look. Candles are universally loved, and this pretty Capri Blue one in an iridescent blush jar is no exception. She’ll strut around the house in these snuggly shoes all winter long, but she can even wear them outdoors if she wants! If she loves a good cocktail, consider this sleek gold and silver set of tools, which comes with its own stand. One can never have too many plain white tees, but this long-sleeve one with a half button-down Henley design will be a staple for her all year. If she loves pulling her hair back, consider gifting her these pretty tortoiseshell clips that’ll keep the flyaways out of her face, but also make a fashionable statement. Obviously not for the colder temps, but how cute are these shoes for your mom in the summer or for her next tropical trip? Mom, meet winter duster chicness. For the mom who loves a sweat sesh, these ombré leggings will be the perfect gift for the holidays. If she loves decking out her guest bathrooms with the most luxurious products, then she’ll really smile when she sees this handsome soap and lotion set in a pretty caddy. I do not know a single person who doesn’t love fuzzy socks. Your mom will definitely love them too. How can a luggage tag be this pretty? Actually had no clue it was possible, but I’m a believer now. Your mom will love it.  Keep that precious head warm with this toasty pom beanie in three cute neutral shades. Update your mom’s workwear with a new knotted twist on an old classic. She’ll love this neutral slide with a wooden heel and braided details. She’ll be the coolest of all her friends with this fun clear shopper with cognac embossed details. Because moms be storin’ stuff, why not get her a cool knit basket to put all her odds ’n’ ends? She can say goodbye to her shabby old roll-aboard and hello to this fabulous rose-gold hard-shell version. Sleeping on a silk pillowcase is the ultimate game changer. Unlike cotton or linen, silk won’t absorb lotions and oils, so her skin won’t dry out at night. This one also claims to combat bedhead and those dreaded sleep creases. If your mom is into being environmentally friendly, get her off sponges and paper towels and onto these cutie lil reusable pot scrubbers, which she can throw in the washing machine after they get dirty. Why, yes, your mom DOES need a comfy robe with a contrasting trim. This diffuser, which smells like citrus and lily of the valley, will help her wind down, breathe deeply, and relax.  Apparently, we’re in a leopard mood, people, but if we’re all feeling it, your mom probably is too. Why not give her a soft pillow in the print to take her couch to a fun, new place.

			 Because I'm cold and miserable and want it to be sunny again, HBU?   I don't care how magical it looks when it snows—after those flurries become dirty slush, those dismal, dreary winter feels start to settle in. So if you're like me and are excited for spring to FINALLY get here, shop some major fashion inspo from these 15 cute warm-weather outfits.  Striped shirts are great!! The multicolored aspect means it pairs easily with other accessories, and it livens up a staple pair of distressed jeans and neutral sandals.  If you're counting down the days until you can wear a dress make this *the one.* Nothing says "spring" like a pale yellow hue, crochet details, and leather sandals.  A jumpsuit makes a pretty bold statement, but if you want to take it even further, opt for one that has both a graphic black-and-white print and a blue floral one. Finish it off with a simple pair of black heels for a polished look.  A mustard yellow maxi skirt paired with a cute white crop top make the "ugly" shoe trend, like these black Tevas, actually look cool. Who would've thought?  Step away from dreary dark colors and commit to a standout outfit that includes a puff-sleeve red top, a rainbow striped skirt, and chic top handle bag. Add a pair of white sneakers to keep the focus on those bright colors.  Are these a pair of pants or a skirt? With super wide-leg culottes you get the best of both and you'll be oh-so comfortable with the higher waist and hidden closure. Pair them with a plain white cami, gold fan earrings, and suede slides for an effortless ensemble.   Athelsure doesn't necessarily mean gray sweatpants and sneakers, take these floral-printed joggers and matching zip-up bomber jacket, for instance. Pair the outfit with white boots, and you'll look very on-trend.  Just because it's springtime doesn't necessarily mean it's warm where you are, so a light-pink turtleneck paired with a corduroy skirt will combat any chill. Accessorize with white sneakers and add a jacket if you need an extra layer.  Matching sets make getting dressed SO much easier—I mean, the outfit is already picked out for you. Pair a coordinating red floral crop top and skirt with tiered drop earrings and strappy sandals for a bold ensemble or wear them separately for a more low-key statement.  Mixed materials can really complement each other—take this knit rainbow sweater and patent leather skirt combo, for example. Contrast the colors with black combat boots for unexpected edginess.  If it's still cooler outside, opt for a neutral turtleneck sweater with cozy ribbed details, light-wash jeans, and a minimal crossbody to channel the transitional weather. You can always trade the patent leather pumps for boots if you're planning on walking a lot.  A trench coat is a springtime staple for in-between weather, but a trench dress, coupled with a simple black long-sleeve top and kitten-heel booties, is understated but elegant. Add a pair of hoop earrings and you can totally take this look out for after-work drinks.  Enter the new season with a pair of flare pants that pack a punch—bonus if they have a vintage-looking floral print. Make sure all eyes are on them by wearing a simple cream scoop neck sweater and sneakers.  Animal print isn't going anywhere, so continue wearing it into the next season with a bright snakeskin-patterned skirt. Commit to the color with a pair of matching boots and then balance it out with a black satin long-sleeve shirt.  Headed to a beach during spring (or wish you were)? A cobalt blue printed maxi is perfect for a trip to the seaside or equally great on a warm day if you're not vacationing. Wear it with metallic sandals and resin earrings to complete the laid back vibe.

			 It looks VERY different from her first wedding gown. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry just got married, and the center of attention has, predictably, been on the gorgeous Givenchy gown Meghan chose. 
  But what's even more incredible than her dress is perhaps all the tiny details that were included her look (just wait until you read about how many flowers were included on her veil!). Read on for all the fascinating facts of this important royal wedding fashion moment, and a recap of all the rumors and speculation leading up to the big reveal.  Before landing the Artistic Director role at Givenchy, Waight Keller previously served as the creative head of Pringle of Scotland and Chloé. Markle met her in early 2018 and, in a statement from Kensington Palace, she was drawn to Waight Keller's "timeless and elegant aesthetic, impeccable tailoring, and relaxed demeanor." The two worked closely on the concept to finish it before the big day.  It also included a California poppy, the flower of Markle's home state, and wintersweet, a British flowering plant, that represented her new home at Kensington Palace.  In a statement, Keller said the veil was a vision they both shared. And it certainly made Markle's entrance all the more dramatic, adding romanticism to her otherwise simple yet elegant wedding look.  Ralph & Russo, Stella McCartney, Burberry, and more were thrown into the royal dress mix of designers supposedly creating Meghan's dress, so Givenchy was a surprise to many. But Meghan and the palace definitely did an amazing job keeping the dress under wraps.   Ralph & Russo: She wore a Ralph & Russo design in her engagement photos. Roland Mouret: The designer is a longtime friend of Meghan's and refused to comment on whether or not he was making The Dress.Burberry: A leading English fashion house that British designer Henry Holland believes is a top contender. According to the Daily Mail, company executives attended "several meetings" recently to "coordinate what has been described as a 'major PR strategy' around a 'high-profile' dress.'"  According to inside sources, the groom-to-be wanted to be kept in the dark about the bridal gown until the last minute. "He’s being very traditional," insiders said via the Daily Mail, "and wants it to be a complete surprise on the day." And apparently, he thought she looked "amazing," according to a lip reader.   "The wedding will be split into two, much like William and Kate['s]," an insider told Us Weekly, "so both Meghan and Harry will have second outfits."  According to royal correspondent Katie Nicholl via Vanity Fair, both dresses will be custom-made. Sources revealed that there will be "a traditional bridal gown for the ceremony and reception, and a glamorous, more sophisticated dress for the evening." So now that we know what Meghan's custom Givenchy wedding dress looks like, it seems that her evening dress might be less traditional.  Per Harper's Bazaar, royal tradition dictates that the Queen has final approval "on the gown's suitability for a royal wedding" and likely gave it the go-ahead in the early design stages.  Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to release this official portrait photograph to mark their engagement. The photograph was taken by photographer @alexilubomirski earlier this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST After People reported that the British-Canadian designer was said to be "staffing up" and employing an in-house PR manager, speculation that Erdem could in fact be creating The Dress went wild. Meghan has often worn Erdem in the past, and the romantic designs are a favorite of Kate's too.  Multiple "royal and fashion industry sources" told the Daily Mail that Meghan chose a "heavily beaded" Ralph & Russo gown that took "hundreds of hours of manpower" to create.  Fans speculated whether Meghan would wear Victoria Beckham, given the fact she recently wore the designer's sweater. But all hopes on that front quickly were dashed. "She looked absolutely beautiful in my jumper," Victoria told the Guardian. "I'm sure it will be a really fun wedding. But no, she hasn't asked me to do the dress." She did, however, score an invite to the wedding.  Meghan wore a strapless column gown to marry Trevor Engleson in 2011. (The two divorced two years later.) But her second wedding dress was the complete opposite of her first in every possible way.  Though there have been rumors that Meghan's dress would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and be even pricier than Kate's McQueen design, that's probably unlikely. "Kate Middleton's dress cost 150,000 pounds," Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight. "It was [Kate's] parents, Carol and Michael Middleton, who paid for that bill. I think it's very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that and, in doing so, try and upstage a future queen."

			 God bless the internet for this!!!!!  We’ve all been there—wearing an outfit that’s just *asking* to get spilled on. You might be on your best behavior, only drinking clear beverages, but there’s no accounting for anyone else in your general vicinity. The bro next to you could be chugging red wine out of a can and get sloppy, and all you can do is grin and say “no big deal” after he sloshes some onto your cute festival outfit.  Or at least...that used to be the only way to react to a red-wine stain. Today, I’d like to introduce you to a genius new fashion hack that I just learned about thanks to Brits Mia and El. But warning: It’s not for the faint of heart.  Poor El was having a grand time at the races when someone spilled wine on her pristine outfit. Instead of throwing a fit, she and her pal Mia decided to strategically pour MORE RED WINE on the rest of her outfit, creating a pretty cool crimson tie-dye effect:  so we’re 2 hours into the races, and el comes and tells me someone has spilt red wine down her... no problem. Got some more red wine and fixed it and I think we’ve just made a new product to PLTs festival range pic.twitter.com/fXnJKYfNc2  Twitter went mad for this quick-thinking solution. I mean, it’s honestly not too far from what you can literally buy online:  Looks exactly like these bottoms actually from plt looool pic.twitter.com/MYguBNgdjp British supermarket chain Tesco even suggested the perfect supplies:  Waste red wine, or drink red wine? - Sandeep 🤔🍷#EveryLittleHelpshttps://t.co/GmAzyiB0A4 pic.twitter.com/qriaZbNY3W  Admittedly, there are certainly some downsides to this hack. Will you be slightly sticky? Probably. Will you smell like a winery? Most likely, but everyone does at the races.  Is your underwear also at risk of getting stained pink? Perhaps, but that’s the reason you wear only black underwear, kids.  And really, why leave this technique exclusively to emergencies? Picture it now: You’re getting ready to hit the town. You put on your staple white dress but pause as you look at yourself in the mirror. Tonight is special. You eye the glass of red wine by your dresser. You pour the glass down yourself, letting it pool at your feet. You can’t stop there. You grab the whole bottle. It’s in your hair, on your shoes—but god, that burgundy looks fantastic. Why stop with wine? Cranberry juice, ketchup, soy sauce. If it’s in your cupboard, then it counts as a fashion hack.  Or, you know, just start carrying around one of those Tide pens.

			 Wait, is that a...Mickey Mouse backpack?! The ’90s were a weird time for fashion. The decade gave us spaghetti straps, low-rise jeans, and crop tops, and according to celebrities, these trends were also more than okay to wear to fancy events—yes, even the Oscars. Here, 52 wild, unconventional red-carpet outfits from the ’90s that you seriously have to see to believe.  Clearly, the ’99 MTV VMAs were a different time, as evidenced by Xtina’s leopard-print cami with lace trim, matching coat, and platform boots.  Whoopi was way ahead of the neon-green trend that’s been in full force lately, but at the Oscars, she paired the hue with deep purple and teal to make a can’t-miss-it red-carpet ensemble. Like, wow, this is a LOT of color.  Halle showed up to the Emmy Awards in an embellished crop top and maxi skirt, proving that, yes, you can bare your midriff at a fancy event!   Christina had too many ’90s fashion moments to pick just one, folks. So here she is again at the Billboard Music Awards in a Las Vegas fringed crop top, a magenta skirt, and VERY crimped hair.  At the European Music Awards, the girl group (pre–Michelle Williams) coordinated in ombré pink-and-orange two-pieces. Clearly, fringed crop tops and maxi skirts were very much A Thing.  At the Golden Globes, the star wore an off-the-shoulder printed duster over black pants and accessorized with a tasseled choker. I mean, can you even imagine her wearing something like this today?   Meryl (aka Hollywood’s reigning queen) went through a blazer-with-giant-flower-brooch phase this decade because she wore them to a TON of events. Case in point? This sunflower and stripes getup at her footprint ceremony in front of the Chinese Theater.  Another red carpet, another maxi skirt—this time worn by Meg Ryan. She paired her pastel yellow one with a short-sleeve knit for a surprisingly low-key Golden Globes ’fit.  To show her support for her husband Will Smith’s Wild Wild West film, Jada showed up to the premiere decked out in fringed leather pants and a cowboy hat. Literally a *wild* outfit, amirite?! Tyra showed up to the VH1 Fashion Awards (which I don’t think even exists anymore?) in metallic sandals, a neutral bandeau, and a brown figure-hugging jersey skirt. Fifty Shades of Grey? More like Two Shades of Beige.  At the Guilty by Suspicion movie premiere, Drew kept it extremely casual in a cardigan, ripped jeans, and brown boots. Is it just me, or did everyone in the ’90s underdress for these things?!  Angela straight-up glowed at the People’s Choice Awards in a bright gold jacket. She really committed to the three-piece suit with a polka-dot vest, ruffled dress shirt, and pants.  At the premiere of Contact, Tyra wore a plain T-shirt, light-wash jeans, a backward hat, a tote bag, and, perhaps most important, Adidas slides.  Ever seen a plush Mickey backpack on a red carpet? Yeah, neither have I until I was blessed with this photo of Drew. She was all smiles with her Disney pal by her side and wore a jacket with white contrast stitching, round tinted sunglasses, and a choker.  At the Eyes Wide Shut premiere, Salma went with a button-down tied into a crop top, a crochet beanie, and a high-waisted leather skirt with lace-up details.   Yes, Carrie Bradshaw wears some truly OTT looks in Sex and the City, but none rival this one that SJP wore in ’95. The metallic bra? The beaded jacket? The satin pumps? There is so much happening here that I am truly overwhelmed.  Okay, I know Cameron has a scarf buttoned into her coat and a fedora, but can we talk about her blue eyeshadow for a sec? If that isn’t the most ’90s thing you’ve ever seen, IDK what is.  At the MTV Movie Awards, Courteney wore a cropped floral top, high-waisted jeans, and extra-strappy white sandals.  Penelope wore a poncho (but a fancy silk one at that) to the premiere of Cookie’s Fortune with dark-wash jeans, heels, and a red lip. Is it weird that I kind of want to wear one now?  At the MTV Movie Awards, Halle opted to wear a bra top with extra-long fringe, bootcut jeans, and a giant flower choker.  Rachel and Monica, um, I mean, Jennifer and Courteney matched in black ensembles at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. But can you even handle Jen’s chic bandanna top and full-length skirt combo?  Uma really made the case for a pink-and-red color combo with this dress, but the jacket tied around her waist is what makes this ensemble so ’90s.  At the premiere of Alien: Resurrection, Sigourney donned this completely sheer white gown and wore black undergarments for ~sexy~ contrast. Also, her bag is made of white feathers, so there’s that. For reasons completely unbeknownst to me, brown was a popular color in this time period, so here’s Jennifer at the Emmy Awards wearing the hue and a coordinating sequined top.  The singer wore a super-slinky two-piece set with a sky-high slit on the skirt to the ’97 MTV VMAs.  At the Light It Up film premiere, Rosario wore a metallic suit with a burgundy top, which happened to match her lipstick color perfectly. Celine is arguably the ultimate fashion risk-taker (remember when she wore a blazer backward?!), and this completely see-through halter dress is just further evidence. It looks even better with her Grammy Award!  The iconic girl group TLC turned up at the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards in coordinating neon ’fits that spelled out their band name. My question is: Did they have to walk around in that same order all night?   There are pretty unconventional outfits at the MTV VMAs, but none have ever come close to this Lil’ Kim one. The only thing preventing a wardrobe malfunction? A lone sequin nipple sticker.  Have you ever thought to pair tiger-stripe tights with a one-shoulder metallic dress? Well, that’s what Chloë did at a New York City movie premiere, here.

			 I refuse to leave the house without these.  For me, sunglasses are more essential than underwear. I don’t even wear corrective lenses—my eyes are just accustomed to having some sort of filter between them and the sun’s rays. Even when it’s overcast, my instinct is to lower a pair of shades from the top of my head or to unclip them from the neckline of my shirt and slide them over my face. Over the years, I’ve learned the importance of finding specs with features like lightweight frames, durable lenses, a comfortable fit, and the ability to filter *just* the right amount of light without altering the appearance of the outside world (aka tinting everything a nauseating shade of green). And after making my fair share of (pricey) mistakes, I’ve finally found the right pair.  Made in New Orleans, Krewe is beloved by celebs including Meghan Markle, who appears to be a fan of the brand’s “Gravier” style. I, on the other hand, am notorious for plopping my St. Louis Classics (sans protection) into my purse before heading out the door—but after nearly two years, I’ve yet to discover even a microscopic scratch on them. They swim in the depths of my bag alongside keys, pens, an umbrella, zippers from a makeup bag and wallet, and the occasional plastic utensil or household item. Every time, they manage to emerge completely unscathed. Aside from their compliment-catching matte tortoise frames, which are finished with 24k gold accents, Krewe’s sunnies feel virtually weightless on the ears and nose. They’re so light that sometimes I think to myself, “Where are my damn sunglasses?” as I frantically search my purse or the nearest countertop in my house. And then I’ll go scratch my face or rub my eye, and what do you know—I’m already wearing ’em. My sunglasses need to go beyond being the right shape for my face. They have to work for a variety of everyday occasions like driving, dining al fresco, traveling, sitting at the park, and walking the dog.    Another plus: You know how some glasses annoyingly manage to pluck a single strand of your hair into their hinges when they’re perched atop your head—leaving you with the choice of plucking said hair from the root or spending a minute navigating it backward through a minuscule screw situation? That’s never once happened with these. The minimalist design also means I don’t feel like a walking billboard when I wear them. None of the brand’s glasses boast large logos or any real branding—save for a tiny gold plate that reads Krewe and rests (lightly) behind your ear.

			 Juicy Couture lipgloss and eyeshadow and eyeliner? We didn't see this coming. Hop in your nearest DeLorean and set that dial back to 2005—because we have major news about Juicy Couture. Everyone's favorite nostalgic fashion brand has finally decided to enter the color cosmetics game—twelve years after launching their first fragrance. The brand announced today that a limited edition line of cosmetics will be dropping soon, including an eyeshadow palette, lipsticks, and eyeliner.  Juicy Couture Cosmetics will be limited edition, and each product was inspired by the latest fragrance called Oui. The brand described the products as "a line of playfully provocative, limited edition cosmetics featuring bold colors and finishes that are as fun and fearlessly expressive as the women who wear them.  Inspired by the optimistic, independent spirit of the Oui Juicy Couture fragrance brand, this collection contains everything you need to convey your inner bad-girl hero: lipsticks, lip glosses, a liquid liner, a face + eye palette, and a multipurpose lip + eye topper," according to a release.  The line is majorly glittery, colorful, and bold—the makeup equivalent of having the word "juicy" splashed across your butt. Most products retail for $18, while the eyeshadow palette costs $38.  juicy A post shared by  Kylie ♥️ (@kyliejenner) on Jan 16, 2017 at 10:57pm PST The Juicy Couture fragrance brand is still going strong, but it's been a tricky decade for the fashion brand. The brand closed all of its stores in the US in 2014, though it's still available at Kohl's. During Paris couture week in 2016, buzzy fashion house Vetements showed a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit on the runway. What followed was a collaboration with Topshop, Bloomingdale's, and Urban Outfitters, as well as a few Juicy Instagram moments from influencers like Kylie Jenner.  Juicy Couture Beauty will be available in October at Macy's, Macy's.com, and on JuicyCoutureBeauty.com.

			 Sorry though, they're already sold out.  If you've been keeping tabs on Disney's line of rose gold accessories and sweet treats as you SHOULD have, you'll know that everything in it is absolutely wonderfully and magically amazing.  Seriously! From the rose gold churros and cupcakes to those sparkly Minnie Mouse ears and bracelets, it's all so freakin' cute. Literally everything that they've released has rendered me speechless. Which is why we were so shook when they released this one-of-a-kind rose gold backpack: From the soft and shiny color of the sequins to the details of the bow and the Minnie Mouse ears, whoever gets to wear one of these is clearly the daintiest and most magical in all the land.  The $85 backpack officially made its debut at Disneyland on June 7 and, well, it's already sold out. Like, really really sold out. As in it sold out that very day. Sorry! (As of Monday morning, Disney has not confirmed if/when the backpacks will be back(pack) in stock.)  Or, ya know, you can pick up one on eBay for $299.99 but that's your call.  And while you're already probably super bummed out, I'm going to continue to rub some salt in your rose gold wounds. Take a look at some of the lucky Disneyland-goers who were able to snag the backpacks before they all bibbi-bobbidi-booped the fuck outta there.  Ugh, just look how pretty:    Related: @ Disney, if you have ANY extra in the back can you send one to the Cosmopolitan.com offices??? Thanks, love you forever.

			 Get your go-go on. Mod styles, tweed suits, and plenty of pastels defined the fashion of the 1960s. Now these iconic looks are making a major comeback. Here, 25 trends from the era that you're about to see everywhere. Printed dresses like these were such a fixture of the decade, you could find them in almost any woman's closet. At the byTiMo fashion show in Oslo, a model wore a multi-colored, polka dot dress over a black lace long-sleeve shirt.  SHOP SIMILAR When you see a pillbox hat, former FLOUTS Jackie Onassis probably comes to mind. Back in the day, this style made any ensemble look that much more polished and proper. The trend resurfaced on the Moschino runway show in February 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Peplum details on bikini bottoms cute-sified the popular bikini swim silhouette in the '60s. In July 2018, Carolina Constas showed a similar style during Miami Swim Week.  SHOP SIMILAR Peter Pan collars were all the rage in the '60s thanks to their demure look. Here, a model walking in Burberry's spring/summer '19 show in September wears a sheer polka dot dress with a contrasting rounded collar.   SHOP SIMILAR The trend of breezy shift dresses of the '60s were a nice contrast to the tight-bodiced A-line styles of the previous decade. This floral one from byTiMo, shown in August 2018, would fit right in.  SHOP SIMILAR Another definitive '60s trend was anything and everything worn with pearls—especially when those pearls were oversized. Women of the era would be thrilled to know that these layered pearls had a major moment at the Ulyana Sergeenko runway show in July 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Matching patterned suits were totally trending at the time and Jackie O. played a major part in that. The style reemerged at the Anna Sui show in February 2018 in the form of this matching teal dress and jacket.  SHOP SIMILAR Gloves—whether they were wrist- or elbow-length—put the finishing touch on all those matching suits women wore back in the day. The trend popped back up at Moschino's spring/summer '19 runway show in September.  SHOP SIMILAR In the 1960s, the bigger your shades, the better. After a brief tiny-frame fad this summer, large sunnies are coming back into the fashion fold thanks to brands like Kate Spade, who showed this big pair on the runway in September 2019.  SHOP SIMILAR Hollywood starlets from the time loved to pair headscarves with oversized sunglasses (see previous slide). Here, a model wears a striped blue scarf at the Lela Rose presentation in September 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR If you binge-watched Mad Men (guilty), you'll remember that SO many characters wore scarves around their necks in the show, which, you guessed it, was set in the '60s. Now, they're back with a vengeance, using updated prints, like the one seen here at Rejina Pyo's runway show in September 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Sure, sequins never really were out, but no one wore them quite like The Supremes, who totally dominated the 1960s with their stellar voices—and fashion, naturally. Here, Kaia Gerber models a sparkly Isabel Marant mini dress paired with knee-high boots on the runway in September 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Miniskirts had quite the moment during this time period thanks to models like Twiggy. They were often worn with knee-high boots, as seen here at Adam Lippes' fall/winter '18 presentation in February.  SHOP SIMILAR Calf socks also paired perfectly with fun  miniskirts during the time. Here's a pair that Miu Miu showed in September 2018 with matching block-heeled shoes.  SHOP SIMILAR Dior's Fall-Winter '18 runway show was inspired by the protest culture of the '60s (hence the peace-sign sweater), but perhaps the most popular accessory at the show was the baker-boy hats that the models wore, which were also widely popular during that era.  SHOP SIMILAR Bright white boots, better known as go-go boots, had such a moment in the '60s. Now, the patent-leather footwear have a modern twist. Take Attico's textured over-the-knee design from their fall/winter '18 collection, for example. SHOP SIMILAR  Why have a regular collar when you could have a FLUFFY collar? This seemed to be the mindset of women in the '60s because you'd be hard-pressed to find a coat that didn't have texture of some sort near the neckline. Here, a model wears a tan leather capelet with a furry trim at Alberta Ferretti's fall/winter '18 show in February.  SHOP SIMILAR Tweed suits and matching sets really took off in the '60s due to their timeless and sophisticated silhouette. Chanel in particular continues to own this trend, finding new ways to update the traditional material, such as this balloon-sleeved ensemble modeled at the brand's show in September 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR The peace sign emerged as prominent symbol during the 1960s. At the Moschino x H&M runway show in October 2018, Gigi Hadid's earrings and hoodie were emblazoned with it.  SHOP SIMILAR Excessive outerwear was the name of the style game at the time, and that meant very shaggy, luxe-looking coats. Loewe's fall/winter '18 runway show got on board with this trend with this neutral style that had shearling trim around the hem, wrist, and pockets.  SHOP SIMILAR Mary Jane-style shoes dominated the '60s. The strap over the foot kept it from slipping out, while the height was (usually) comfortable to walk in all day. The traditional silhouette received a trendy update with a super-high block heel and polka dots at the Miu Miu runway show in February 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Softer hues like lavender and sage were everywhere during this decade, and women loved to wear them in monochromatic outfits, much like this suit that from the 3.1 Phillip Lim runway show in February 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Lots of '60s dresses featured a belt around the waist in the exact same fabric. It pulled the whole look together. Here, the belted trend lives on with this pink coat dress from the Vivetta runway show in September 2018.  SHOP SIMILAR Baby heels were everywhere during the era, and the fact that they're popular again is amazing news for your feet. These comfortable shoes, featuring a bright plaid pattern, appeared in the Shrimps' fall 2018 collection.    SHOP SIMILAR While matching sets had a major moment in the '60s, mixed patterns also had their day in the sun. Designers like Diane Von Furstenberg are bringing this maximalist trend back. Take a look at this outfit from her fall 2018 look book.  SHOP SIMILAR

			 It was an interesting show. It's men's fashion week over in London right now, so there are lots of runway images hitting the wire, but the ones from designer Xander Zhou's show on Monday really have people talking. That's because he had many of his male models walk the catwalk with fake pregnant bellies. This is what they looked like: Some wore tight T-shirts lifted up so the prosthetic stomach was in full view, and others clutched their covered gut region with nurturing arms, which, as Fashionista pointed out, helped distinguish their fake preggo stomachs from, like, beer bellies. At least one model wore a shirt that said, "New World Baby." As far as the meaning behind the prosthetics, the brand had this to say post-show on Instagram: "At Supernatural, Extraterrestrial & Co., we're prepared to welcome a future of male pregnancy."  Beyond the baby bumps, there was more eye-catching stuff going on, like, WTF is this? Also, this interesting hair choice and sunglasses-slash-headgear hybrid happened. But then, these styles also walked down the runway, so I'm really not sure how to feel about the whole thing. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 I mean, spring is great and all, but beach weather wya?! Can't wait for summer? Yeah, me neither. If you're ready for the beach no matter what time of year, then you'll want to know about these fashion-forward handbags and shop them right now. From neon to wicker to actual fishnet purses, here are the 11 trends to sport during the season.  The lightweight material and its natural tan hue make the perfect addition to your summer accessory collection. The fun circle shape also sets it apart from the boxier bags you own.  The light brown shade of this makes it a neutral that'll complement all your summer frocks.  The gold accents and tassels dress this one up a bit so you can take it from the beach to the bar.  The black ribbons give this style a pretty contrast against the natural straw.  Perfect for summer stadium concerts—and also just when you want to see all your sh*t—these transparent ones are cool but super practical.  Sling this versatile design across you body body or wear it at your waist; plus, the polka dots add a playful touch.  This small cutie fits only the essentials, and the pink hue mixed with the sporty vibe keeps it fresh.  This one MULTITASKS. Use it with the strap for all your hands-free summer concert needs, and, if you're going through TSA, remove the strap and to hold all your toiletries.  Wooden beads are not only for jewelry anymore. These natural beauties are begging to be paired with jean shorts or a dramatic fringe dress, as seen here.  This multicolored beaded crossbody will go with all your cute summer outfits.  Go for a nautical vibe with a striped beaded hobo.  Sometimes the simpler the accessory is, the better. This plain tan-colored tote is the perfect way to get in on the trend.   Neon colors were all over the Spring/Summer 2019 runways and are definitely here to stay this summer. Not feeling a head-to-toe look?That's where accessories come in. Add a pop of the hue to your outfit with a bright handbag.  This neon orange is as bold as it is useful because you can wear it as a belt, ring clutch, or crossbody.  Two trends in one: a mini bag AND neon. Double the reasons you need this RN.  Perfect for all your gym gear, and it even resembles a tennis ball.  Watch out for your AirPods because these mesh net designs are here to stay. They're great to use as a reusable grocery bag, but they also look cute as a purse. It's basically a win-win.  The "catch of the day" is this cute blue netted style, perfect to bring to the farmers market.  The bad news? You might lose a lipstick. The great news? You'll never get sand stuck in here.  This open weave one is totally beach-ready, and the bamboo handles polishes off the look.  Like Dorothy's iconic basket but with extra sophistication, you can bring these woven wicker styles to more than just a picnic. The material is also harder than straw if you're looking for added protection.  White is basically the official color of summer, so combine two trends in one with this bag.  Opt for a cylindrical style with navy lining and leather trim for an extra dose of chic.  Keep all your valuables secure with a style that has fabric you can tie in a knot.  Jazz up a solid-colored purse with tons of colorful embroidery, as seen here with this personalized Dior tote.  This bold yellow bag looks even more cheery with a stitched floral pattern.  Hit the beach with this style that depicts a dreamy seaside setting with palm trees and ocean waves.   Combine geometric and floral patterns with this gorge style.   Another way to add fun to your accessories is by toting a purse with multicolored pom poms. This playful trend pops up every summer, and it's reminiscent of all those arts and crafts classes you took at summer camp (but in a good way). A bag that features pom poms and tassels is like wearing double the accessories.

			 You’ll look like straight-up FIRE.  If you want your summer dress game to be as hot as the weather outside, scroll down for plunging necklines, bodycons, and leg slits guaranteed to stop everyone in their tracks.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! A slinky slip dress is easy to throw on and feels breezy on those unbearably hot summer days. Summer’s around the corner, so it’s prime time to break out all your white dresses. This one, with its buttons and low V-neck, will definitely spice up your warm-weather wardrobe. This pastel dress keeps your look flirty, thanks to its fitted silhouette, bold color—oh, and its allover ruching. A bodycon with a psychedelic black-and-white optical illusion on it is super fashionable. Add see-through mesh fabric and it’s undeniably sexy. Shoulder ties that pull into a bow are not only convenient for adjusting, but they also look pretty dang flirty. Everyone on the sidewalk will do a double take when you breeze past them wearing a bright red halter dress with an open back. A leopard-print mini with flared sleeves is the perfect combination of retro and sexy. Stay cool with this floral number featuring a dramatic cutout and a short ruffled hemline for a hot look. Give your ’fit a moto-chic vibe with a black denim mini complete with silver buttons and a square neckline. A red dress with a corseted top gives a traditionally sweet polka-dot print a bit more oomph. Put a daytime spin on your LBD with a ruffled mini that has see-through lace trim. A figure-hugging strapless style with neon stripes is extremely on-trend. Experiment with various lengths and proportions by mixing long sleeves with a short hemline and bare shoulders. An asymmetrical design never fails to grab attention, especially if it also features ruching on one side. A classic fit-and-flare skater dress is a great go-to for summer, but added keyhole cutouts on the front give the silhouette a fresh spin. Channel your wild side with a subtle leopard-print dress made chic thanks to its waist tie and flutter sleeves. Stripes may not be inherently sexy, but details like puffy sleeves, an itty-bitty keyhole cutout, and a short hemline really transform the print. A summery knit midi that clings to every curve will quickly become your fave dress—especially because you can easily match it with accessories.

And now, the backpacks are back and smaller than ever!   Northcote Road Zip-Top Small Backpack, RADLEY LONDON (Available at Macy's), $245  SHOP SIMILAR For years, it's been all about the skinny jean. But prepare to embrace extremely wide-legged pants, much like model Karlie Kloss's pictured here.

Oversized Patched and Distressed Denim Jacket, SOHO GLAM (Available at Amazon), $20 SHOP SIMILAR Platform sneakers were definitely for those who loved the comfort of sneakers but still wanted to look six inches taller — Baby Spice was a huge fan.

Chuck Taylor All Star Canvas High Top Sneaker, CONVERSE (Available at Amazon), $49 SHOP SIMILAR These were a must for any '90s "Tommy Girl" — the classic red, white, and blue logos appeared on everything from shirts to sweaters to skirts.

Women's Big Logo T-Shirt, TOMMY HILFIGER (Available at Amazon), $40 SHOP NOW Spaghetti-strap tops and dresses were worn to elegant soirees (à la Gwyneth Paltrow's 1999 Oscars ensemble) and were the "going out" style of the '90s.

			 Here's where you can get it. Most girls have an entire Pinterest board worth of style inspo saved for when they finally get to take engagement photos with their future spouse.  But Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber's spur of the moment engagement is anything but traditional, so when the two finally announced it on Instagram, Hailey went for a look almost as shocking as the proposal: a $40 tank top. Yep, instead of opting for a $500k designer gown to match her $500k ring, the model wore this simple $40 crop from LA brand Cherry. I repeat: A FORTY DOLLAR TANK TOP TO TELL THE WORLD SHE'S GETTING MARRIED TO JUSTIN BIEBER. That must be some freaking shirt.  Right now, there are only two sizes left on the website, so if you want to dupe Hailey's engagement style, you better start typing your debit card number now.

			 Which look is your fave?  In Los Angeles on Sunday, Selena Gomez went to her first red carpet movie premiere in two years for Hotel Transylvania 3 — and, can I just say, she looked amazing in this two-piece Oscar de la Renta ensemble. Sel's outfit consisted of a bustier crop top and high-waisted midi skirt with raw hems and she accessorized it with silver Tiffany & Co. jewelry (worth a whopping of $21.5K!!!), a matching clutch, and embellished heels. In case you're experiencing a little bit of déjà vu looking at the blue-and-white print of her outfit, that's because you saw it on none other than Meghan Markle in June.  The Duchess of Sussex wore the same exact pattern when she attended the wedding of Celia McCorquodale (i.e. Prince Harry's cousin and Princess Diana's niece).   Meghan's dress, also by Oscar de la Renta, was more on the conservative side with its long sleeves, maxi skirt, and drop waist silhouette. She paired it with a white fascinator for the formal occasion.  PRE-ORDER NOW Oscar de la Renta Long Sleeve Cocktail Dress, $5,490 on modaoperandi.com It's the twinning moment I never knew I wanted, but I'm so glad it happened. What's better than your two faves wearing matching outfits by the same designer?  Maybe, like the rest of us, Selena saw Meghan's ensemble and wanted to channel royalty. Either way, you can shop similar dresses below if you're digging this blue-and-white theme, like I am.

			 The one-piece works for date night, parties, and...Halloween. Kylie Jenner recently gave a tour of her purse closet that contained more designer bags than I could count. From this three-minute video alone, her lifestyle certainly seemed unattainable. But, as lavish as Jenner portrays her life to be, she can also do a 180 to show off her more affordable style. In an Instagram post on Thursday, the 21-year-old snapped herself in an off-the-shoulder black jumpsuit, which complemented her fresh blonde bob haircut.  The one piece came from Fashion Nova, a brand Jenner's worn multiple times on the 'gram, and costs only $25. Though I know Jenner likely gets paid to post about certain brands (an Instagram post from her is reportedly worth $1 million), this jumpsuit would be something she'd wear IRL. She follows in sister Kim's footsteps in terms of wearing super tight body-con clothing. To top off her look, Jenner wore a pair of gold initial earrings–a "K" for Kylie—and a pair of the now-sold-out Adidas "Falcon" sneakers. I have to admit, whether Jenner really loved the bodysuit or wore it as an #ad for the brand, the piece looked really good on her. So much so, I thought about buying it. The one piece would make a sexy, cat woman suit for Halloween, don't you think?   chillin in my @fashionnova A post shared by  Kylie ♥️ (@kyliejenner) on Aug 16, 2018 at 9:55am PDT

			 Getting nothing done for the rest of the day, LOL.  Just when you thought you were done online shopping with Amazon Prime Day, now Nordstrom’s epic Anniversary Sale is here. (Apologies to your wallet.) But there are crazy deals happening in every category, including clothing, accessories, beauty products, home goods, and more, that you definitely don’t want to miss out on. The sale is now open to everyone starting today and runs through August 4, but be warned: Things sell out fast! Here, 18 items you’ll want to grab ASAP.  A mini with a zipper front and raw hem will look so good with a band tee and snakeskin boots. Meghan Markle loves her MOTHER jeans, so you can rep the same brand now at a *huge* discount. This black pair looks super sleek and edgy—especially when paired with a leopard-print top. The perforated material on these tan sandals gives your feet some much-needed air in sweaty temps, and so many reviewers say they’re super comfy.  Nordstrom shoppers are obsessed with this Zella Body sports bra for both high- and low-impact workouts, thanks to its support and smooth, nonirritating fabric. Square necklines have been popping up everywhere this season, so get in on the trend with this beige tank. Pair it with high-waisted jeans for a retro vibe. These statement gold hoops face forward, so everyone can see the tiny lil stars and moons on them. Awww! The leather material makes them dressy, but the cutouts make ’em casual. Basically, these black flats are super versatile.  A breezy boho shirt will be your new go-to this season—the fabric doesn’t cling to your skin in hot weather. If you’ve been looking for an excuse to FINALLY get a pair of wide-leg pants, opt for these stretch ones that come in four other colors. If you’ve always wanted a pair of Ray-Bans, you’re in luck! Since these guys are clear, they’ll go with all your ’fits, and the lenses give you 100 percent UV protection. If you’re into layering necklaces, make this Gorjana locket a new addition to your jewelry collection. The sparkly opal stone will look gorgeous in the light, and you can fill the space inside with something special. A dotted jumpsuit like this looks cute with sneakers, but you can make it look more elevated with heels and statement jewelry. And again, there are pockets! Slouchier than your typical tote bag and convertible, this style comes in three other shades and also expands for even more storage space. Summer’s in full swing, so treat yourself to a breezy yellow-and-green floral dress. (When worn with heels, it also makes a great wedding-guest look, just sayin’.) Clogs are happening, folks! The wood-sole shoes are surprisingly comfortable with their platform heels, and this pair is perfect for summer. Not feeling the blue? It also comes in more muted colors. Girl, get yourself a cute new brunch outfit in the form of this multicolored floral jumpsuit. It also has a tie at the neckline and POCKETS, so what more do you need, really? A pair of sensible heels will get way more use than stilettos, and these suede ones are great to wear both in and out of the office. Over your skinny jeans? Go for retro-looking flares instead. This popular Good American pair looks good with heels, sandals, and everything in between.

			 There's a perfect white shoe out there for everyone, folks.  You'll look extra cool in a pair of hi-top shoes, and although this pair has a skateboarding vibe, you'll be surprised to find that it actually goes with a LOT in your closet—yes, even all your flowy, floral dresses. Kate Middleton is a fan of Superga shoes and with good reason. The silhouette is simple while the canvas is pretty durable, so they'll totally become the staple in your closet that you didn't even know you needed.  Not a fan of an all-white shoe? Instead, opt for a pair of Veja sneakers that feature a vivid emerald green shade in the logo and on the back heel. As a bonus, they also happen to have a cool retro aesthetic.  For some added height, snag a pair of these thick-soled Keds. They're in the same classic silhouette you already love but the platform makes them feel fresh and trendy.  If you like sneakers that are equally sporty as they are fashionable, get yourself a pair of Adidas Gazelles. The iconic style makes your feet feel light, while the diagonal stripes keeps them stylish.

			 Just because the weather is sad doesn’t mean your outfits have to be.  Summer and fall have come and gone...and that’s when the weather really takes a turn for the worse. But just because you’re constantly freezing and miserable and the icy wind practically slices through you doesn’t mean you can’t look absolutely stylish. Add some bright colors and new silhouettes to your winter wardrobe with these 12 fun shoe and boot trends. Some are practical and others not so much, but you’re guaranteed to get all the compliments when you bravely venture outside. Keep clicking through for major inspo.  Try a tough-girl look with this season’s It Shoe—aka combat boots. It’s the perfect staple to add to any winter wardrobe.  If you want to test the trend but want extra height, get these burgundy babies. Docs will never go out of style, so opt for these classic boots that will last a LONG time. FYI, the more you wear them, the more comfortable they’ll be. Choose a white combat boot for a lighter look. The wrap-around laces and buckle detail add some more edge. The ultimate girlish style is back (you def had a pair of these in middle school, right?) but with a chic twist. At the Miu Miu, Paco Rabanne, Tory Burch, and Area shows, there were luxe-looking Mary Janes everywhere.  Two in one, yes please! These Charles and Keith shoes have a strap that is easily removable, so you can wear them as simple block-heel pumps too. Get them while they’re hot! This amazing collaboration between Coach and Tabitha Simmons couldn’t be more perfect—just look at this cute floral style. You can never have enough leopard-print shoes. This square-toe style can easily be paired with a dress or jeans. Ditch those pointy-toe boots because this season, it’s all about boxy square-toe silhouettes. I don’t make the rules!  This square-toe boot from Topshop is about to become your go-to thanks to the neutral hue and subtle stitched details. All your other boots will be jealous because wow, this option with a metal heel is absolutely gorgeous. This caramel shade is perfect for all your neutral looks. Pair ’em with a blazer and cropped trousers for an elevated outfit. No other boot will make you look more polished than this silhouette. This photo is all the proof you need.  Found: the perfect tan knee-high boot to pair with everything. These boots are made for walking, indeed. This stacked heel is the perfect height to be running around in, and the vivid color ensures you’ll be noticed. There is nothing like finding *the* perfect black boot. Wear this elegant style from day to night. The lace-up boot is back and chicer than ever! Each designer that featured this style on the runway kept the essence of the Victorian era.  A sleek patent-leather bootie will catch that winter light in the best way. This kitten-heel Victorian boot is great for just a lil height. Snakeskin print was everywhere this season, from shoes to belts to handbags. The pattern in this design combined with the structural heel looks v refined. OTK boots are heeere. Bonus points that they double as tights and keep your legs warm.  The gunmetal shade of these suede boots looks super polished. The black over-the-knee design is a classic on a cold wintery day. Try pairing these boots with a duster coat in earthy tones. Don’t worry about switching out your shoes  when you arrive to work with these water-resistant gems. The lug sole gives you traction and the rubber material keeps water O-U-T, but they still look sophisticated enough for the office.  Croc-embossed shoes were popular last season and are about to blow up even more this time around. These forest-green boots are perfect to walk around in during a snowstorm while still looking ~fashun~. This lug-sole boot is the definition of feminine meets edgy thanks to the thick sole and millennial pink hue. This heeled boot with its grippy soles will be perfect for trudging through slush-covered streets. The T-strap is another timeless shoe that made a strong comeback on the runways, like this olive-green one at Altuzarra. A cute lil wedge adds an inch, and this pair also comes in nine other colorways and patterns.

			 The previously sold-out dress is back. Fans of Kate Middleton's polished style will be overjoyed to hear that they will now be able to buy her iconic engagement dress again.  ICYMI: Prince William and Kate Middleton announced their plans to marry back in November 2010, and Middleton's sapphire wrap dress caught everyone's attention. In fact, it sold out almost immediately and the label responsible for the look, Issa London, couldn't keep up with the immense demand and had to close the company. Cut to 2018: Issa has relaunched at British store House of Fraser, and is now selling the Kate Tie Wrap dress in green, though more colors are expected to follow eventually. It is significantly cheaper than the original — the first retailed for around $600, while the new version will cost $140. Additionally, Issa has designed another similar style, which features a fitted skirt rather than a flowing one. That dress is now available in black, royal blue, and red.  And, yes, House of Fraser will deliver internationally for anyone desperate to get their own version of the Duchess of Cambridge's classic piece before it sells out again.

			 That's what sisters are for!  There's no denying that both Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton have impeccable style, but when it comes to marrying into the royal family, your fashion choices inevitably change to follow specific rules. According to Entertainment Tonight, Markle is receiving sartorial advice from her future sister-in-law and which protocols she should follow. "She has provided Meghan with names of some of the favorite U.K. go-to designers on everything from dresses, coats and the all-important British hat,” a source told ET. So you could see Markle wear designs from L.K. Bennett, Temperley London, Erdem, and Jenny Packham, who are just a few of the Duchess' favorite picks. Both already have shown a liking to Alexander McQueen – Middleton's iconic 2011 wedding dress was a McQueen creation, and she's worn many more dresses from the designer since. Markle, meanwhile, stepped out in February wearing an Alexander McQueen pantsuit.  And they both share a love for affordable brands, including Zara and J. Crew. Markle has proven to be a rebel when it comes to royal protocol (she's not the biggest fan of pantyhose or clutches), but who wouldn't want fashion guidance from Kate Middleton?  
 On the off chance you haven't marked your calendar yet, Markle's wedding is set for May 19, and perhaps she's taken her future sister-in-law's tips to heart when choosing her wedding dress — which I, for one, cannot WAIT to see.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Top hats? Got ’em. A cane? Mm-hmm. Shoulder pads? You betcha. The People’s Choice Awards is my choice for gawking at, screenshotting, and obsessing over red-carpet fashion. (Gotta have hobbies, you know?) Really, I just want a walk-in closet with all these dresses (is that too much to ask?! don’t answer that). Anyway, before we all tune in on November 10 to watch the 2019 awards show on E!, let’s take a look at more than 40 years of the flyest fashions that have hit that star-studded red carpet. Mary Tyler Moore *sparkled* in this long-sleeve sequined dress. Sparkled! Name a more iconic duo. I’ll wait. (I’m talking about Jodi and her crocheted beanie, obvs.) TBH, I wish I were wearing this outfit rn.  Brooke Shields’ cuuute blue printed dress has as many palm trees as your “dream vacay” Pinterest board. How do you spell “glamour”? M-O-R-G-A-N mothereffin’ F-A-I-R-C-H-I-L-D. Just look at that top hat! What is happening? I love it?! Screaming. (In a good way.)  Brooke Shields definitely raided my childhood closet for this dress and I’m fine with it. Lil bb Drew Barrymore posed on the red carpet in a metallic dress with a posh white fur and pearls, winning the Most Adorable award in my heart. Oh, and then the next year, she rolled up in style dressed in a pink ball gown like she was straight out of a fairy tale. Cinderella who?  Life lesson: Don’t just win awards. Dress like them. Basically, serving white-hot lewks was sort of Heather Locklear’s thing. Beads, beads, and more beads. Because too much is just enough. Phylicia Richard looked radiant in her blue sequined dress. Same can’t be said for whoever was standing next to her, I’m guessing. Life was, um, simpler and covered in velvet back then. Carrie Bradshaw could never. Okay, fine. She could. The bigger the shoulder pad, the closer to whoever is sitting next to you. Think The Craft, but make it fashion. Gorgeous! The dress too. The ’90s-est look to ever ’90s and I love it. I vow to love and cherish this dress for as long as we both shall live. The pop of lavender beneath her shawl = sooo pretty. Christina Applegate’s off-the-shoulder black dress and choker is a Hot Topic dream. Y2K, check.  For the chicest garden party you’ll never throw because you live in a studio apartment. (It me.) 13 going on 30 more dresses I want to add to my closet!  All Fanistons know: Jen can make anything fabulous. See: this plunging black top and pants with a diamond choker. And a wooden cane due to a broken toe. “My presence is a present.” —This dress Right angles are right for a reason, you feel me?  The red heels for a pop of color? *chef’s kiss*

			 “Lemme pinch those lil cheeks of yours. You’ve grown so tall!” —Fashion influencers, everywhere Take a look at any of the pictures from this past fashion month and you’ll see a very interesting trend emerge. Glasses chains—yes, the kind your grandma always has on so she doesn’t lose her frames—are the new-new. Something equally surprising? They’re actually really pretty and fun! Now’s the part where I show you a bunch of great pics of street-style stars rocking this stuff in all the possible ways to wear it to get you to agree with me! :) Some people wore the delicate ones. Others chose thick lucite versions, which, IMO, are super baller. Still more went with more whimsical chains, like these stars: You can wear them behind your neck, classic-style, or just dangling in front, like a hat strap.  Here’s a behind-the-neck shot. And here’s a dangler. The girl in the stars, above, wrapped her chain around her neck a few times, which is also a fresh way to style this vibe. You know that after looking at all these pics, this trend is starting to wear you down. So many flirty colors! So many ways to wear it! So many opportunities for your parents to be like, “Wait, why is this happening on your face right now?” Luckily, you are not alone in your adoration for this old-timer accessory. Shop with me! I promised my coworker Ashley that I’d leave you with this: “No granny chains, no granny gains.”

			 I also threw in some early '00s styles because I couldn't help myself.  If you grew up in the '90s, then you probably definitely wore a handful (IF! NOT! ALL!) of these shoes. Meanwhile, your parents were like, "Why does my daughter insist on wearing clear sandals that always look dingy and offer no arch support?" Times were good. Footwear was rubbery. Oh, and I also threw in some early '00s styles because I couldn't help myself.  SO. SQUISHY.  Jellies were cool but why does everyone ignore the fact that after, like, an hour, they were completely full of foot sweat?   These were lined with the same material as a woven straw beach mat. You still have no idea why.   Your junior high hallway was a sea of rainbow mesh slippers.   Doc Martens were everything. You loved yours (or your knockoff pair) until they smelled so bad, your mom made you throw them away.   These shoes look harmless, but they were the loudest slides to walk in. The straps were made of some kind of stretchy elastic, so every time you took a step, the heel would slap the bottom of your foot. They paired nicely with capri pants and a hair bandanna though.   You told yourself that these were really comfy because of the rubbery spongey stuff, but in reality, they were actually just annoying.   Every girl who was ever Sporty Spice in her talent show owned these. And the cute guys in middle school did too.   Rainbow platforms. When was the last time you heard that description?   Holographic stuff were the coolest. These are straight out of Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.   You saw these at all the cool girl stores at the mall, but your mom definitely didn't let you buy them. You settled for some that were only 1 or 2 inches tall instead.  Both guys and girls wore these. You wore them everywhere and pretended like they went with everything. They only kinda did.  These things were as dangerous to walk in as they were popular. You definitely slipped and fell in these bad boys more than a few times.   Hilary Duff wore platform sneakers like this on the cover of The Lizzie McGuire Movie (which you owned on tape or DVD if you were fancy), so naturally you needed them too.   Skechers. It's the S.   You might not have had these in pink, but you definitely owned them in black. And wore them to the seventh grade dance.   Rachel on Friends wore shoes like this and you told yourself, "When I'm 20, I'm going to own these in every color."  Why did they ever make shoe soles like this? You would leave black scuff marks all over the P.E. floor and get gravel stuck in the bottom after recess.   You could pretty much wear these guys with everything: oversized bombers, cute jeans, halter tops...basically everything they sell at Urban Outfitters today. Stepping onto the basketball court at recess rocking Jordans was the ultimate power move.  In fact, the hierarchy at middle school was basically determined by who owned a pair and who didn't. The official uniform of all Julia Stiles-in-10-Things-I-Hate-About-You wannabes. Chunky skate shoes = the epitome of the '90s. You were secretly jealous they didn't have more of these in the girls' department. We all remember that one girl who'd walk around school in these. Was it you? It *was* you? That's fine, no judgment. Steve Madden was the undisputed shoe king of the '90s, and nothing was more on-brand for the decade than clogs. To All the Girls Who've Tried to Channel Melanie C Before. Being a preteen in the '90s meant you went from playing with dolls to trying to look like a doll real quick. You paired these with a plaid miniskirt and hoped you didn't get stopped in the hall for a dress- code infraction. These running shoes look like they came from outer space, but that was part of their charm? You def had a pair. Pairs nicely with the dime bag of weed you bought off your best friend's older brother (DW, we won't tell your mom). If you were a tomboy, these were a must. You agonized over which color to get...before inevitably settling on white, because '90s. Two '90s essentials: Barbie roller skates and a matching wrist cast for when you broke your arm riding your Barbie roller skates.

			 Good thing I have my debit card number memorized.  Urban Outfitters is having a huge sale filled with hundreds of items, and the best part is they're all under $20. I KNOW. Shop these 21 ridiculously low-priced items below—they'll make great additions to your closet, apartment, and medicine cabinet.  Get in on the tiny sunglasses trend with a pair of small, reflective frames that feature rounded edges and give your whole look a vintage aesthetic.  A chambray racerback bra top pairs perfectly with any high-waisted bottoms, whether it's a pair of breezy linen pants or a denim skirt.  These slip-on flats are perfect for summertime because of their lace-up details, which gives the classic shoe a unique twist.  A plant-based perfume formula with notes of jasmine and vanilla will make your hair smell oh-so fresh—no one will even notice if you skipped a wash.  A classic gingham top with smocking details pairs easily with jeans or fancy black culottes. It also has a halter you either can hide or choose to tie around your neck.  You might have always wanted to try a body chain, and a sale is the perfect excuse to do so. Whether you're lounging on the beach in your bikini or wearing a T-shirt while running errands, a minimal silver one adds shine to any outfit.  A gold necklace with a rose pendant is perfect to layer with your other chains, but it's also just as pretty on its own.  A striped tank top with a ruffle V-neck is a staple piece you'll want to add to your summer wardrobe—it looks just as good with sandals as it does with sneakers.  If you like packing a product to wash your face with, but are scared of it leaking in your bag, look no further than a solid cleansing stick that starts to lather with water. The size is travel-friendly, and the cap makes it mess-free.  Opt for a pair of drop earrings that dangle just far enough to see through both long or short hair. The pale blue hue matches the ocean or pool, and the size is perfect to fit your towel, sunscreen, and all your other necessities.  Pull-on jeans never looked so cool thanks to the cropped silhouette and seams down the back.  Add some romantic details to a simple braid by weaving a ribbon through it. Accessorize with a straw bag and chic slides, and you'll look like you're strolling along the Champs-Élysées.  An ombré vase that reads "Nice Stems" is one you'll want to snag—and throw a gorgeous bouquet in—ASAP. A pair of slides you can wear to the pool and while running errands are ones you won't want to take off. Plus, the black-and-white color scheme means they'll go with most of your summer clothes.  A one-piece with lace-up details and cut-outs also works as a regular shirt—just put on a pair of denim cutoffs over it, and you've got yourself a look you can wear to the beachside bar.  If you have tons of crop tops but are unsure of what to wear them with, try a white denim skirt with a zipper-front closure for added edge.  A hanging planter is great for small apartments: It adds much-needed greenery to your home without taking up precious floor or counter space.  If you're religious about applying SPF (as we all should be!), a small tin with mineral sunscreen containing coconut oil and cocoa butter is easy take with you in your bag for touch-ups.  Nothing inspires vacation vibes like a tropical blue-and-white palm-printed wrap skirt.  A multi-colored tiny tote fits all of your necessities and is still super stylish.

			 No more annoying pinching, pulling, or adjusting!  The breathable mesh inserts differentiate this style from the rest of your black bras, while the padding gives some extra lift without going overboard.  In addition to the no-slip silhouette of this bra, it can also transition into a racerback, strapless, and halter style so it'll be one of your most versatile pieces.  If you have any low-cut T-shirts, tops, or dresses, but still don't want to go the braless route, this plunging sheer bra is the perfect option. The underwire cups ensure everything is secure, while the see-through fabric makes it sexy.  If visible bra lines leave you frustrated, opt for a style that is totally seamless. This one has a romantic sweetheart neckline and offers inclusive sizes spanning from small to 3x.  Whether you're lounging around the house or want to channel that off-duty model look, the Calvin Klein logo bralette is a must. The cotton fabric is lightweight, while the white contrast band makes it trendy.

			 It's 4 p.m. Do you know your boob shape? For whatever reason, buying a bra and figuring out your size is one of the most complicated processes ever. So I asked Ra'el Cohen, the chief creative officer of indie lingerie brand ThirdLove, everything you possibly need to know about these pretty little underthings. Scroll on for some knowledge. "Your bra is trying to talk to you — that's how I think of it," Cohen says. "At the end of the day, take special note before you walk in the door and rip off your bra — which is typically what women do — of what's bugging you. Are you feeling the hook-and-eye closure in the back? Is it scratchy? Are you feeling the wire digging in? Where is that wire digging in — in the middle or on the sides? Has your strap been slipping all day? You know you're not comfortable, but sometimes we're so busy we don't take the time to figure out how or why." Cohen suggests taking what she calls the "T-shirt test." "Put on a tight white T-shirt, and if you can see the bra very clearly, whether it's the cup edge bulging or gaping, or the strap or the sides where it might be digging in, you're wearing the wrong size," she says. Basically, a store attendant measures your rib cage and bust area with a measuring tape. That tells them your band and cup size. But that's not all. "She's doing more than just measuring you. She's also looking at your body shape, your breast shape, and how far apart your breasts are," Cohen says. "She's also seeing what brand you're currently wearing and the size you think you are." Yes! There are seven major boob "types." Here they are: "People are always focused on the size of a bra — the band and cup — and that matters," Cohen says. "But breast shape and bra style is also incredibly important. For example, if you have east-west or side set breasts that point outwards or have ample space between them, it's very difficult for you to wear a full underwire around your whole breast." Cohen says women with those breast shapes should find a bra with a shorter wire, that stops underneath the breast, instead of encircling it. Nope. There's a concept called sister sizing that nobody really understands. But here's the gist of it, using 34B as an example: A 34B is the same thing as a 32C — the 32C just has a shorter band. If you're going up a size, a 36A is also a B cup — it just has a longer band. "If you are a 36A, and you want a smaller cup," Cohen says, "you'd be a 36AA." "If you're an A and you go down, it goes double, triple, quadruple — all of those are smaller," Cohen says. "At the opposite side of the spectrum, there's a double D — that's bigger. It really is confusing. They don't do it that way in Europe, it's just a U.S. thing. At ThirdLove, we do D, then E, F, G, H, because it just makes more sense." "One reason could be that you have narrow shoulders or sloped shoulders," Cohen says. "If that's the case, we'd recommend a bra like a plunge bra or a racerback bra, where the straps are further in to combat that. You can also just try adjusting the straps to see if that helps." According to Cohen, many women buy bras online and never adjust the straps to their own measurements when they put them on. That leads to a lot of slippage too.    "You probably have, like, 20 bras in your drawer, including some from around 10 years ago. You don't need that many," Cohen says. "I recommend two to three neutral-toned T-shirt bras — whatever is closest to your skin tone. Those are  your workhorses — you're going to wear those every day. Then, I recommend a black or colored T-shirt bra if you like that and want to have that variety. Then, a nude and black strapless set, and a nice lounge bra or bralette for comfy moments. That's seven bras total." Please don't do this! According to Cohen, elastic stretches out as you wear it and needs 24 to 48 hours to shrink back to its original form. If you're wearing the same bra every day, after a few months, it's just going start to look shapeless or wonky. You don't want that. Well, that depends on how often you wear it. If you're wearing it multiple times a week, definitely wash it once a week. If you don't wear it as often, you can have more time in between washes. Cohen also says the number of times you wash your lingerie depends on how much you sweat, which is different for everyone.   Technically, yeah, but everyone knows you won't. The best thing to do if you're going to machine-wash your bras, according to Cohen, is to put them in a lingerie laundry bag. That way, they'll keep their wire shape, and not snag on anything else. Whatever you do, Cohen says, do not put them in the dryer. "Heat is the enemy of spandex, and every bra has a little bit of spandex in it," Cohen says. "Heat makes it break down and lose its shape."

			 #TBT to all those big waist belts.  It’s been over a DECADE that the Kardashian fam has been kaptivating America, so you better believe Kim’s style has changed a lot since she first became a reality star. Now, she’s a designer, an influencer, and a full-blown business mogul, and she has the clothes to match. Take a trip down memory lane to see some nostalgia-inducing fashion pics from the early aughts, and keep clicking to see just how much her style has transformed over the years.

She attended the event with Paris and Nicky Hilton and wore a white sundress with a matching white purse and espadrille wedges.

			 They won’t want to return any of these.  The big day is finally happening, but what do you even bring as a gift to congratulate the couple? Sure—pots, pans, knives, and other housewares are useful, but if you’re looking to give the happy pair something more unique, here are 22 ideas to differentiate yours from the rest.  Gather all their most adorable, heartwarming photos, then get them printed on this heart-shaped collage. The frames are also customizable, so there’s a color and style that’ll match their place. The best remedy for a stark white room is a gold planter with a bright green succulent in it. If the newlyweds are moving into a brand-new space, this will liven it up. A thick woven throw in this neutral color will complement any sofa, no matter the color. With this personalized map, they can mark all their important life events, like where they said “I do” or where they had their first kiss. Cuuute. Wedding planning can be stressful, so now that it’s over, indulge them in a soothing massage and relaxing dip in the pool. Is it just me, or are fresh bars of soap so satisfying to use? Either way, this set is a great gift for their home—they can put one bar in their own bathroom and another in the guest bath. A glass frame that comes in various sizes is super versatile, whether the couple wants to use it for hanging wedding pics, artwork, or pressed flowers. Now they can pop open a bottle of wine or champagne in an elegant silver bucket adorned with both of their initials. Once they find out how soft these sheets are, they’ll want to end their honeymoon early just to sleep in them. (Only half kidding.) Everyone will instantly feel welcome at their place with a simple doormat that greets them before they even walk in. This isn’t any ole cutting board: It swivels to reveal cheese knives and comes with three white dishes for easy snacking. Are they an eco-friendly couple? They’ll love this recycled yet stylish glassware in their kitchen so much, they’ll want to keep it on display.  Why pick one class membership when this one gives so many options? Whether they are already a fit couple or just want to be more active, ClassPass lets them choose which workouts they want to do. With a subscription that gives them access to gorgeous bouquets on the reg, their house will never be without greenery. If their ideal weekend scenario involves curling up on the sofa and reading, they’ll think of you every time they reach for a book with this thoughtful gift. Even if they’re not super-experienced bartenders, they’ll have fun trying out new drink recipes with this 10-piece tool set. Plain white pillowcases instantly get more stylish thanks to the baby-blue embroidery. As a bonus, this gift set comes with a soothing night cream both of them can use. They’ll probably be protective of their new furniture (and with good reason) once they’re all moved in. Meaning: They’ll be super thankful to have modern coasters to prevent those dreaded water rings. Romantic date nights at home will be more frequent when they have an excuse to use this gorgeous, hand-painted porcelain dishware. Give them a reason to break in their new wine glasses when bottles featuring their fave varietals show up on their doorstep every month. Le Labo’s Santal scent is one of the brand’s biggest fan favorites with amazing reviews. Odds are, they’ll be obsessed with this candle and want every room in their place to smell just like it. Surprise them with a vacay—whether it’s a week or a weekend—to a place where they can unwind. (Bonus points if it has an infinity pool.)

			 After analyzing customer returns, size 15 was born.  Good American, the denim brand launched in 2016 by Khloe Kardashian and Emma Grede, was built on size inclusivity. And although it's carried a size 00 to 24 jeans since its inception, the brand has discovered a customer it was overlooking in between.  After analyzing customer data, Good American found it received 50 percent more returns of size 14 and 16 jeans than any other size in its range. "My design team and I believe that the reason for this is that between size 14 and 16 we switch from using a 'straight' pattern to a 'plus' pattern. In the plus pattern, allowances are made for a totally different body type, which you might not necessarily need if you’re at the higher end of the straight sizes or the lower end of plus," Emma Grede, co-founder of Good American, said over email.  So to combat the issue, they invented a new jean size: 15. Launching Thursday, the size will be available as part of Good American's new 'Good Curve' collection in a variety of styles including straight and flare cuts. The price points range from $159 - $169.    During a time when many brands are trying to profit off the body positive movement without putting in the work (or even offering plus sizes), Good American's hands-on approach to customer feedback shows it's serious about putting its money where its mouth is.  "A large part of our success comes from listening to our customers and directly applying their feedback. Our new fit and size have been in the works for nearly a year after reviewing our customer data and size patterns. From there, we used social media to find a focus group of women who fell between sizes 14 and 16 and brought them into our office. We measured their bodies, listened to their concerns and needs, and understood what they were looking for when it comes to denim in order to perfect the new size," Grede said.  The fashion industry still has a lot of work to do when it comes to size inclusivity and it could stand to learn a thing or two from Good American's strategy.

			  "We honor the beauty she brought into this world."  Kate Spade, the founder and namesake of the iconic handbag brand, died this morning by suicide. The fashion world and celebrities have been grieving the loss of the icon all over social media, and the brand itself just shared its own statement via Instagram.  "Kate Spade, the visionary founder of our brand, has passed. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly heartbreaking time. We honor all the beauty she brought into the world."   Kate was found this morning in her Park Avenue home, and she is survive dby her husband and 13-year-old daughter. She was 55 years old.  She founded the brand in 1993 with her husband Andy. At the time, it was strictly handbags, and was called Kate Spade Handbags. It eventually expanded to everything it is today: jewelry, shoes, clothing, stationery, eyewear, fragrances, home decor, dinnerware, and more. She sold her remaining shares of the company in 2006 to Neiman Marcus, who already owned the majority stake, to raise her daughter Frances, who is now 13. Then, in 2017, the same company that owns Coach (Tapestry) bought Kate Spade from Neiman Marcus. At the time it was valued at $2.4 billion, but she didn't see any of that money herself, as she had sold her shares in the company.  In 2016, she had started a new fashion line called Frances Valentine, which also focused on handbags and shoes.  If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 SO WARM.  There comes a point in life where it kind of feels like if you’ve seen one pair of slippers, you’ve seen them all. Well, hold that thought, because Urban Outfitters recently unveiled a pair of slippers that will completely blow your mind.  They’re called the Smoko Heated Slippers, and they look like adorable little bao buns that you wear on your freaking feet!!! The $35 slippers are plush and fluffy, but the coziness doesn’t stop there. The slippers can actually plug into a USB port and heat up your feet. Welcome to the future, people. BTW, these slippers also come in a corgi version, which is downright brilliant. Catch me spending my next paycheck on BOTH pairs.  Anyway, if you want a pair, they’re only available on pre-order right now. But given how much attention they’re receiving (and how freaking awesome it would be to have heated dumpling slippers!!!), you might want to act fast.  While the dumpling slippers aren’t out just yet, people are already raving about the corgi version. “They heat up a lot more than expected and although they are very large, the footbed is as snug as a glove,” one reviewer wrote. “These slippers are so adorable and WARM and comfortable,” another said: “Bought them as a Christmas gift but already ordering another pair for myself.” That seems to be a trend, because another reviewer said they also “bought these as a gift and have already bought another pair.” Welp, I’m sold. Also worth noting: Urban Outfitters is also selling a matching dumpling light and heated dumpling plushie. So! You can eat dumplings while basking in the glow of a dumpling-shaped light, cuddled up with your dumpling plush, while staying cozy in your dumpling slippers. If that isn’t the stuff of dreams, IDK what is!!!

			 Bouquets and cards appeared at the brand's shops across the country. After the news of Kate Spade's death broke on Tuesday, fans of her work took to her eponymous label's storefronts to pay tribute with touching notes and flowers.  Fans of handbag designer Kate Spade leave flowers outside Madison Ave store.  A sister says Spade resisted getting help because of what it would do to her image.  @wcbs880 pic.twitter.com/7GqKYqTUXf  On that day and the following day, the flagship store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan was roped off with an area for mourners to pay their respects. Messages left there read, "RIP to an iconic and outstanding woman," "I'm so sad + so sorry. Thank you for bringing so much color and beauty to our lives," and, "Our lives are as fragile as dragonfly wings. Look after each other."   Shoppers also gravitated toward the store, buying pieces that reminded them of the label's founder, who, at the time of her death, was no longer involved with the brand.  Leaving the store with a new crossbody bag, one customer, Rachel Beck, told reporter Sara Germano, "I thought it'd be a nice thing to do today." Some women came out to the Kate Spade store on Madison Avenue to pay respects to the late designer, though she is no longer affiliated with the brand. Rachel Beck, below, bought another cross-body purse. "I thought it'd be a nice thing to do today." pic.twitter.com/haonlsOlxT By Thursday, the ropes and flowers had been taken away and replaced with a tribute the label released in response to Spade's passing: "Kate Spade, the visionary founder of our brand, has passed. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly heartbreaking time. We honor all the beauty she brought into this world."

			 It was a JOURNEY.  There was a time when I thought I would NEVER wear high-waisted jeans. In high school, wearing low-rise jeans with a  1-inch crotch was my naïve way of attempting to look cool and sexy; the thought of buttoning pants at your belly button seemed decidedly opposite. Well, folks, the times and trends have obviously changed—and so have my ideas of what I thought was sexy, thank God. In 2018, high-waisted pants are Where It's At. 
  I came around to wearing them when I went out on a limb and bought a wide-leg pair because of a deal that was WAY too good to pass up. As soon as I put them on, I realized how insanely comfortable a higher waistline could be. Anyway, now, my newfound passion has led to this: Trying on what seems like thousands of pairs to find THE perfect ones. Wow, it has been a journey, but now I know all the best ones and can share all of them with you! The Best High-Waisted Jeans in Every Style to Stock Up On Stat 
 Best Skinny  I had never tried Good American jeans before, but, man, was I missing out. These skinnies fit like a glove and, after trying on so many pairs that didn't hug my waist just the right way, this one was a godsend. It felt like I could lounge on a sofa all day long wearing these, yet they still looked like a rigid pair of jeans.  READ THE FULL REVIEW Best Wide-Leg  These babies are one of Madewell's top-rated styles for a reason: the fit was flawless, the rise hit right at my belly button, and the minimally distressed hem adds a little extra something. The inseam also comes in both regular and tall so you can choose what length you prefer depending on where you want it to hit on your leg.  READ THE FULL REVIEW Best Crop Flare  Crop flare, kick flare, demi boot jeans—whatever you want to call them—are perhaps my favorite style because they're tapered to the leg and open wider towards the ankle. You get all the benefits of a skinny jean, but your ankles don't feel constrained. I didn't want to take this pair off, and they're basically a no-brainer considering the price tag.  READ THE FULL REVIEW Best Straight-Leg   Yes, they're pricey, but these jeans have a rise that's almost 12-inches long, so they're about as high as they get. The straight leg has a slight crop that hits just above the ankle, while the medium wash makes them a great "everyday" jean. They also have subtle stretch so they slide right on—no jumping up and down needed, thank God.  READ THE FULL REVIEW Best Stretch  These have an amazing amount of stretch while still having a denim feel to them (i.e. they aren't like a typical "jegging," like the ones so soft they don't even feel or look like jeans). They come in four different washes, from light to dark, and the "authentic stretch" style is also available in a cigarette jean in addition to the skinny silhouette.  READ THE FULL REIVEW  Best Skinny Jeans After doing some internet sleuthing, I came across this Good American pair, which has great reviews and is also $60 less than the brand's other best-selling "Good Legs" style. Why? It's in a different fabric and undergoes a simpler wash process but has the same exact fit and feel as the $159 option.  The brand also has a diverse range of sizes, from a 00-24. While my size did fit, I could've worn a size smaller if I wanted them to feel more snug—but overall, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I also didn't have to point my toes or tug them vigorously to get the openings over my feet, unlike most super skinny jeans I've worn.  
      Best Wide-Leg Jeans   They also come in two different lengths—regular and tall—so the hem hits where you want it to depending on your height. And, just so you know, you can get these monogrammed for an extra $10 if you're into personalization.        Best Crop Flare Jeans American Eagle is a great place to look for wallet-friendly jeans that don't skimp on style. Case in point: these cropped flares. They had just the right amount of stretch, and the size felt spot on. Also important: They made my butt look kind of amazing. This pair comes in three different lengths—short, regular, and long—so you can opt for more of a cropped style or one that covers your ankles.  Some reviewers note that the dye can have a strong smell (although I didn't notice that with the pair I tried on), and, FYI, the brand recommends you wash them in cold water before wearing them so the color doesn't transfer. But on the whole, these hit all the marks—they're affordable, they fit well, and they're SO cute.        Best Straight-Leg Jeans   J Brand is a favorite of Kate Middleton's (she often wears the skinny 811 style), and while it offers a wide range of fits and rises, I decided to try this straight-leg pair because it's SUPER high-rise (it's 11.75 inches, and because I'm only 5'4" it went well above my belly button) and they didn't disappoint. The material was incredibly soft, and they were just the right length—not too cropped, not too long. (I high-key hate when my jeans are too long and I'm left with bunched ankles.)   I would suggest sizing down for a tighter fit at the waistband and throughout the legs. Although these jeans are pricier, J Brand has other high-waisted styles that retail for around $100 as well.       Best Stretch OK, so a lot of jeans out there have stretch  to them—what makes this Everlane pair stand out? Well, they seemed stiff when I initially took them out of their package, but they completely molded to my body in the best possible way. Basically, they're still rigid and denim-like but they also move with you and feel almost like a second skin. They also happen to have more than 2,000 reviews and a 4.71 rating out of 5 stars.  The inclusive sizes range from 23-33, and the cut has a trendy, figure-hugging fit. The only thing I had to note was that when I sat down for a period of time and stood back up, I had to reach down and un-bunch the fabric from behind my knees—it was slightly annoying, but all positives considered, it was a a pretty minor issue.

			 You'll want all of these in your closet STAT.  ASOS is having an amazing sale, where already-discounted items are up to an additional 60 percent off, and there's no better reason to buy that perfect summery dress for your wardrobe. Below, 15 of the best maxis, minis, and everything in between that you'll want to wear all season long.  A printed dress that looks like a top and skirt will make everyone do a double-take, and you'll receive all the compliments.  Everyone's heard of the LBD, but a little white dress, especially one with a ruffle hem and sexy, strappy back details, is ideal for summer.  A leg slit gives a maxi more sex appeal, while a soft pink hue makes it sweet.  You'll definitely look like a ray of sunshine in a one-shoulder floral maxi dress.  Lingerie-inspired clothing is trending, and a silky dress with lace details will make you feel ultra-sexy when worn with heels.  A light blue and white plunge dress will totally give off summery vibes – especially when paired with lace-up espadrilles and an on-trend straw bag.  Bright yellow is the new millennial pink, and a sleeveless dress with a high-low hemline will catch the breeze and make you look effortless while on-the-go.  A sweet mesh skater dress won't feel swelteringly hot in the rising summer temperatures, and it's also dressy enough to wear to a wedding or bridal shower with a pair of heels.  The off-the-shoulder trend isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and that's great news because a striped shoulder-baring dress with ruffle sleeves is about to become your new go-to summer outfit.  Another off-the-shoulder dress is made more eye-catching with bright, dramatic stripes in the skirt.  You can't go wrong wearing a lacy white dress in the summer, especially one that's perfect for a romantic dinner date.  A dusty rose-colored midi is anything but simple with a statement-making fishtail hem and square neckline.  A floral wrap dress that can be dressed down with Converse sneakers or up with a pair of wedges is a priceless addition to your summer wardrobe.  You're going to look so cute on – and off – the beach in a flowy maxi dress with cute bow detailing on the sides.  An eggshell blue-hued dress with pleats and lace inserts is great for a summer wedding, engagement party, or any formal event. The silky material is light enough that you won't break a sweat, yet the sleeves and below-the-knee hem will keep you covered.

			 Straight from the runways at New York Fashion Week! Find out what everyone's going to be wearing come fall. Many designers this season chose to show crop tops with visible underwire following the typical curve of a bra. At Alexander Wang, the style was shown in a long-sleeve, fur-trimmed gray shirt, which was paired with matching leggings. Visible underwire was also a major trend at Jeremy Scott, where this hot pink track suit was modeled. At Dion Lee, the trend was a tad more formal, appearing in turtleneck form beneath a layer of sheer fabric and paired with white jeans. Plaid has always been in style, but now it makes a major statement in saturated hues like hot pink and cobalt. This oversize suit jacket with matching pants from Dolan is a perfect expression of the trend. Son Jung Wan paired an eye-catching blue plaid blouse with shiny flares. At Tanya Taylor, red and blue plaid appeared in a skirt and top combo, accessorized with blue booties. Puffer coats are a fall and winter staple, so it's no surprise they popped up in many fall/winter 2018 shows. This season's designs, however, were even more dramatic and eye-catching than usual. Among the looks at Christian Cowen was this metallic green jacket, which featured over-emphasized puffs. Kim Shui showed a puffer coat with a statement collar in a delicate floral pattern.  At Prabal Gurung, bright colored puffers walked the runway in oversize bomber form. Come fall, get ready to see plenty of vibrant red for sale.  Ashley Graham walked the Prabal Gurung runway in this head-turning number, complete with cold shoulders, an asymmetrical neckline, and a mermaid silhouette. At Philipp Plein, this model trudged through (fake) snow wearing crimson thigh-high boots and a matching shearling moto coat. Taoray Wang showed this attention-grabbing trench coat, pairing it with black shoes and a matching belt. Lingerie continues to be a major inspiration in the fashion world, with many designers highlighting the bustier-like construction of their dresses. At the Brock Collection show, a model displayed the trend in this steamy black design. At Lanyu, the attention was on the intricate boning details of certain dresses.  Tadashi Shoji emphasized the bodice of this design by adding black seams on top. Hot pink was present at almost every major show during NYFW this season.

Neons were big at Jeremy Scott, but the hot pink tones were especially eye-catching. Here, model Romee Strijd sports a velour skirt suit with matching thigh-high Moonboots.

Gigi Hadid walked the Prabal Gurung runway in a white knit top with furry sleeves, accessorizing with a patterned scarf. Tanya Taylor showed this gray trench coat with fuzzy cuffs from the elbows down. Fashion houses were enamored with this color combination during FW '18. Christian Siriano showed multiple looks that were pink and red, including this sleek midi dress. Prabal Gurung featured the two-tone look in blouse form. At Self Portrait, a baby pink dress was styled with a bright red sweater. Many designers featured head-turning bows as a detail in their pieces. At Christian Cowan, a model walked in a silver minidress complete with a huge bow on one shoulder. Brandon Maxwell showed this pretty red design with a large belt tied at the center. Ulla Johnson's rust-hued strapless dress featured a giant bow in the middle of the bodice. Capes added drama on tons of runways this season. Noon by Noor's version of the trend came attached to this billowy floor-length black gown. Bella Hadid walked in this velvet design at Prabal Gurung, which featured two capes flowing behind her. This crew-neck Christian Siriano gown had a surprise cape with a train in the back. Bright yellow showed up on plenty of FW '18 catwalks. This sunshiny suit made a statement at the Bottega Veneta show. At Eckhaus Latta, this pretty cold-shouldered maxi was shown in a sweet yellow hue. Brandon Maxwell's runway included this fitted jumpsuit in the color. Whispy feathers added texture at many runway shows. At Christian Cowan, the detail softened the line of this two-tone, black and white dress. Pamella Roland showed this feathery party dress at her NYFW show. Son Jung Wan featured this blue vest with feather details on the collar. Animal print had a major moment this season, and colorful versions were a Thing in particular. Joan Smalls walked Tom Ford wearing this red leopard-print getup. At Concept Korea, a model walked in a green leopard-print hat and skirt, pairing it with a matching fur coat. Adam Selman showed a red, zebra print minidress, which was paired with matching booties. Romance was a solid theme at many of the shows, which meant plenty of ruffles. Ulla Johnson emphasized the trend with this tiered-sleeve, fluttery-collar, floor-length dress. The collar and cuffs of this blush blouse at Bottega Veneta featured exaggerated ruffles. At Brock Collection, a model walked in a gray sweater with a peplum ruffle detail and a coordinating skirt with a frilled hem. Mixing and matching similar floral patterns in drastically different color schemes was a major theme at many shows. Alice McCall showed this skirt and blouse combination in pink, black, and white, pairing it with metallic pink footwear. At Tanya Taylor, a model wore a pink floral blouse with a black floral skirt, accessorizing with a blue stole. Nicole Miller showed a large floral print on white juxtaposed against a smaller floral pattern on black. Pretty much every runway had something in this color. At Dion Lee, a model walked in a silk maxi dress paired with a matching shearling. This silky rust maxi and lacy blouse were a hit at Jonathan Simkhai. Jason Wu showed this pleated rust dress with a stomach cutout and black straps. It seemed like there was a sequin suit in every show this season. Tadashi Shoji showed this rose gold power suit. This green getup turned heads at Greta Constantine. Malan Breton showed this blue sequin striped number. Gold and rose gold have had their moments, but this time, it's silver's time to shine. This pretty, V-neck design wowed at Cushnie et Ochs. This liquid-metal effect silver outfit was shown at Bottega Veneta. Philipp Plein showed these silver snow pants with a matching bandeau and snowboard. Brands put particular emphasis on pockets. At Alexander Wang, a model walked wearing a leather minidress with circular, zipper-trimmed pockets. Jeremy Scott showed this lavender and turquoise sweatsuit with contrasting pockets all over. At Son Jung Wan, a model walked in this eye-catching coat, complete with standout yellow pocket detail. Tiered skirts are about to be everywhere, especially in black. Alice McCall paired this one with a cold-shoulder crop top. BCBGeneration's presentation included this multi-tiered skirt paired with a cropped leather jacket. The design was shown in a high-low silhouette  at Cinq a Sept. During the shows this year, sleeves grabbed attention by switching up textures, adding different colors or patterns, or playing with proportion. This blazer with eye-catching fuzzy sleeves had a major moment at Noon by Noor. Son Jung Wan showed this yellow jumpsuit with color-block bell sleeves. Eckhaus Latta showed this camel jacket with exaggerated sleeves. Not only were capes a big deal at this season's NYFW, cape sleeves were a category in and of themselves. Pamella Roland's show included this gorgeous burgundy design, with sleeves a-flowing. At Prabal Gurung, a model walked in this shiny, cape-sleeve gown. Christian Siriano showcased this dramatic cape sleeve moment for his 10th anniversary show. Silk played a large role at the fall/winter shows, especially in midi-and maxi-length dresses. At Adeam, this two-tone yellow dress made a major statement. This robe-like design was a showstopper at Hellessy. This billowy, floor-length design was paired with matching yellow footwear at Pyer Moss.

			 Also, everything is, like, $50 and under?! Shopping on Amazon can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to fashion. I mean, there are seemingly millions of brands and items to sift through. I get it! (When you finally land on something that catches your eye, the amazingly fast shipping and thorough product reviews make up for it though.) If the time has come to browse for some new fall wardrobe styles on the site but you’re a little unsure of where to start, stop what you’re doing now and check out the brand Floerns. It’s available only on Amazon and it has some SUPER-cute clothes at prices that are almost too good to be true—but they’re surprisingly the real deal.  It has v on-trend snakeskin- and leopard-print pieces in a variety of silhouettes.          There are endless amounts of denim jackets (which are waaay inexpensive, FYI) in light to dark washes, with distressed fabric, or even in camo patterns.

The tweed shifts, chic pussy-bow blouses, pencil skirts, and printed dresses from Floerns are perfect for the office (and also stylish enough to wear to a happy hour after).

This is definitely a great resource for adding to cart on the extremely large site if you’re completely frazzled by the sheer volume of the clothing inventory. (*raises hand*) One more plus? All the products are available on Prime, which means free two-day shipping, baby. So if you’re looking to add some standout pieces to your closet this fall, I’d get shopping ASAP.

			 They’re the worst to put on, but, wow, are they cute.  If you’re the type of person who doesn’t like giving up wearing skirts and dresses even in the dead of winter, there’s a solution for you: TIGHTS. Yes, they can be annoying to get in and out of, but they definitely add a little extra something to your outfit while also somewhat protecting your legs from freezing temps. Another plus? There’s no need to ditch your open-toe sandals because with the addition of tights, all of your favorite shoes can now be worn year round. Praise be! Here, we’ve rounded up 20 winter outfit ideas with tights so you can get all the cold-weather fashion inspo. From printed ones to sparkly pairs, there’s no shortage of fun tights to wear this season that will complete your winter lewk.  These tiny polka-dot tights are a great way to add subtle details to a solid-colored velvet wrap dress.  Add this festive pattern to your outfit in the form of tights. It looks so cute with a corduroy skirt, loafers, a white tee, and a fuzzy cardigan.  Style down these loud tights with a black miniskirt, chunky sweater, and lug sole boots, so that they’re the main focal point.  These Lurex tights are glittery without going overboard. Wear these to a fancier occasion with strappy heels, a see-through top, and bow-adorned skirt to keep the dressy vibes goin’.  If you need extra warmth with your cocktail dress, try a pair of sheer tights that are close to your skin tone. Ones that have subtle sheen to them coordinate with metallic pumps and a sequin dress.  A printed tight (these ones are a straight-up optical illusion!) can be a bit busy, so an all-black ensemble consisting of leather shorts, a black top, and lace-up booties balance it out. A simple sheer denier is subtle and chic. (FYI, the lower the denier, the sheerer the tight.) For extra warmth on your commute to work, try a leather jacket and plaid flannel layered over a silky slip dress.  These floral net tights in black are fun and flirty. Complete the look with a neutral knit turtleneck and a black miniskirt to show ’em off.  These opaque gray tights differentiate themselves from all your black pairs, but go with just as many outfits. Worn with a buttoned skirt, white sweater, and loafers, this is definitely something you can wear to the office on a cold day.  For a fancier occasion, these are the tights to whip out. You will (literally) shine at any holiday party. Combine it with an exaggerated puff-sleeve cocktail dress and pumps for extra drama.  Fishnets really do go with everything, including this very cute celestial dress with contrast trim. You can also wear them under ripped jeans for an edgier ensemble.  Tights that blend in with your skin tone are subtle yet elegant. Pair them with a pleated snakeskin midi-skirt and coordinating top.  One hundred denier are the MOST opaque tights you can get. These ones are sure to keep you warm and give off Parisian chic vibes. Pair them with a printed miniskirt, a black sweater, and loafers to make it effortless.   Pro tip: Vertical stripes can give the illusion of longer legs if that’s what you’re going for. Pair your striped tights with a suede skirt, knit sweater, and black pumps to elevate your ensemble.  These are v opaque, but have some shine to them when they catch the light, so obviously they go perfectly with a colorful sequin party dress.   For a fashion-forward ensemble, try matching your printed tights exactly to your dress for an Insta-ready ’fit.  If you have a favorite skirt in your closet, try matching your tights to a color of choice from the pattern. Dress it up with pumps or down with ankle boots.  It’s easy to make a cold dreary day seem more cheerful just by wearing brighter colors like these baby blue pastel tights with a yellow double-breasted coat.  These sheer polka-dot tights are playful, especially when you mix prints. A plaid skirt, abstract sweater, and shiny Chelsea boots pull the whole ensemble together.  If you’re not afraid of a bold outfit, then you’ll totally go for a pair of bright red printed tights. A belted skirt, thick-soled boots, and a cozy sweater make this a more everyday look.

			 So basically, every recent picture of her. On October 15, Kensington Palace announced that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were expecting a baby, and people were THRILLED. At the time, Meghan was reportedly 12 weeks pregnant and had just landed in Australia. With just weeks left until they welcome an adorable royal baby, it just has to be said: Meghan has totally nailed this whole pregnancy style thing. Let's review all her looks, shall we?

			 But it's for a very unexpected reason! There's a lot of speculation about what Meghan Markle will wear for the royal wedding on May 19, but now we know for sure one piece she won't have on: the same tiara Kate Middleton accessorized with for her big day. 
  Kate's 2011 headpiece, also known as the Cartier Halo, was originally made for the Queen Mother (a.k.a. Elizabeth of York) in 1936; Queen Elizabeth II later received it as a present on her 18th birthday. It's set to appear in an exhibit at the National Gallery of Australia just days after Meghan and Prince Harry's nuptials, making it an improbable choice for Meghan's wedding outfit. The Halo is part of a collection of 300 tiaras, necklaces, brooches, and earrings on loan from the Royal Collection Trust for the display, taking place from May 30 to July 22 and titled "Cartier: The Exhibition."  But just because Meghan can't top her head with the Cartier Halo doesn't mean she won't wear a tiara at all — she's got plenty of others to choose from. Let's dive into the options, shall we? Given the fact that Meghan's engagement ring has two stones from one of Princess Diana's brooches, experts have theorized that Meghan may end up wearing the Spencer Tiara, which Diana wore to her wedding to Prince Charles. Unlike the other head piece options, which would come from the royal vault, this design belongs to Diana's family, the Spencers; Diana's brother Charles, the current Earl of Spencer, now has it. Us Weekly reports that if Meghan will have the opportunity to borrow it, if she wants.  The Queen Mother received this floral crown on her wedding day as a present from her parents. According to Marie Claire, experts assume this is the frontrunner due to its more modern and romantic appearance, and to the fact that the rest of the modern royal crew (i.e. Princess Eugenie or Kate Middleton) hasn't yet worn it. If Meghan were to choose it, it would be considered to be on long-term loan, and Meghan could wear it to any formal function afterwards.  This tiara is made from a necklace gifted to the Queen Mother by her husband — and Queen Elizabeth II's father — George VI. It's part of the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe and has less sentimental meaning than the other options. As Harper's Bazaar notes, the choice to wear this piece over another would be more about fashion than anything else.  This piece is closer to a headband than a tiara, as it lays flat on the head instead of being tilted up. Experts think the less frilly, more modern appearance could make it a contender for the royal wedding, given Meghan's sleek style. The Art Deco design originally belonged to the Queen Mother as well. It could be that Meghan won't want to wear something from the family vault for her big day, in which case a custom-made tiara might be a good option. Pippa Middleton wore a new design for her wedding in 2017, and it could be that Meghan chooses to follow suit. After all, reports Harper's Bazaar, it could be the perfect opportunity to create a new piece with Harry, something that she could pass down to her own children. Hey, there's also the possibility that Meghan's simply not a tiara girl — and that's totally fine! Although the choice would be unexpected, it certainly could happen. "Almost every royal bride who has married in Britain since the 1930s has worn a tiara on her wedding day, so it's a good bet that Meghan will too," royal jewelry writer Ella Kay told Town & Country. "But she could choose to go without a tiara or she could wear another kind of jeweled ornament in her hair." Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 This jacket has nothing to hide. Emily Ratajkowski is no stranger to posting sizzling pics that liven up your Insta feed, but the photo she uploaded on Wednesday night was just... Wow. I mean, see for yourself: In the image, which she called a "Sneak peek 💦," she stares at the camera, wearing nothing but a neutral-colored trench coat. But this jacket is literally not covering anything going on underneath. Like anything. Need a reminder? Anyway, the sneak peek she's alluding to must be a photo shoot of some kind, because she tagged her go-to makeup artist Hung Vanngo and NYC hairstylist Teddi Cranford. Her plastic coat is honestly very on-trend this season, so if you're interested in copying her aesthetic, shop the below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 From G-strings to boy shorts and everything in between.  Okay, so maybe cheeky underwear is your absolute favorite, but you want to branch out just a bit. Or maybe you're in need of a specific style for a slinky, form-fitting outfit. Whatever the case, there are actually a lot of underwear styles out there and it's worth knowing what they are—and what outfits they're best for. There are, like, 5,345,675 options out there (especially considering many types are combined—i.e., seamless hipsters or high-waisted briefs) so shopping for new pairs can be truly overwhelming. Hopefully, this makes the process just a *little* bit easier the next time you're in  a department store—or you down an online shopping hole. This style is really the skimpiest type of underwear. I mean, there's barely any fabric, but that's the point! They're most useful when you want to wear that form-fitting bodycon dress without having to go commando, since they create a smooth silhouette with little-to-no visible lines.   Not feeling the floss-like straps of a G-string? A thong is the next best option with a little bit more coverage while still not showing any VPL. BUT contrary to what Kylie Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and Kim K have done, just be careful not to hike the side band higher than the rise of your bottoms or you'll get that dreaded "whale tail."  Like most bikini bottoms, this underwear style is low-rise, offering just enough coverage for your butt. It's also a go-to silhouette to wear to the gym since most styles are made of cotton, which is one of the most breathable (and comfy!) fabrics when you're breaking a sweat.  Similar to a bikini, but as the name blatantly says, more...cheeky. These make a great everyday pair that are a little more playful. Most pairs have a wider hip band, but there are also versions with thinner ones as well if that's what you prefer. Wear 'em with jeans, dresses, skirts, you name it!   "Granny panties" get a bad rap, and while this silhouette is more modest, there all sorts of styles out there that are still super cute. Plus, extra coverage is never a bad thing if you like it! These are a great silhouette to keep in your drawer for constant wear (they also come in a variety of rises)—just know that they're not guaranteed to hide panty lines if that's a concern of yours.   
  A cut that channels men’s briefs, hence the name "boy shorts." They offer ample coverage and the length of the legs stops at the top of the thigh or can even extend past it. Wear them under flowy shorts and skirts to protect against those out-of-the-blue winds. Also, they make for great loungewear.   If the boy short and bikini had a baby, it would be the hipster. It sits low on, well, the hips with wide waistbands. They also show off some cheek and come in all types of materials including mesh, cotton, nylon, lace, and microfiber.  High-waisted jeans and swimwear have become increasingly popular over the years, and the same is true for underwear. This silhouette doubles as shapewear if it has a control top, but there are also plenty of styles without this feature as well. The rise can range depending on your torso length, but most hit the bottom of your navel or extend past it. They are great under delicate fabrics like a slip dress because they create a smooth shape, but you can also opt for a textured or lacy pair if you want to feel more fancy.  
  Like G-strings and thongs, seamless underwear is also a good choice for something very form-fitting. The pairs are not only insanely soft against your skin, but the fabric lays super flat (i.e., it won't dig into your hips) so that no lines are visible. The bottom line? It contours to the exact shape of your body and feels like a second skin.

			 Bring on ALL the sweaters. Even when the temps dip below freezing, you still want to look cute—i.e., not like a walking marshmallow—this winter, right? There’s tons of outfit inspiration out there, from chunky knits to faux-fur coats to long-sleeve jumpsuits, that’ll not only keep you toasty warm, but also make you the most stylish person on those slush-covered streets. Here, 20 cute winter outfit ideas that won’t give you the chills…and might actually make you like the cold weather.  A patchwork sweater that has multiple colors goes with so many things in your closet. Wear it over a printed midi skirt with some white mules, and you’ve got a comfy office look.  Not THAT cold yet? Opt for an open sweater with a white T-shirt, distressed jeans, and black booties for an effortless ’fit.  Throw on a big coat over a denim one-piece and you’re ready to step outside, but you’ll be just as warm indoors thanks to the long sleeves.  Less is more, as they say. A simple turtleneck A-line dress is a classic that you can dress up with heels or down with casual sneakers or boots.  A brown coat against white denim, shoes, and a mockneck is the key to one simple, elevated winter outfit.  Go the athleisure route when it’s cold with a short puffer coat over a gray hoodie, medium-wash jeans, and black kicks. A shoulder bag keeps any winter necessities (i.e., your phone charger, mittens, chapstick, duh) close.  Winter clothes are often oversized, which is great if you’re into that! But if you want something more figure-hugging, a belted, ribbed sweater dress is subtly sexy yet warm, and it happens to look amazing with animal-print boots, just sayin’.   If you’re in need of something more formal to wear, look no further than a checkered V-neck dress. Make it winter appropriate with a faux-fur coat and black heeled booties.  A brown waist-tie coat with leather pants and beige sweater is undoubtedly chic. (Neutrals are v in, in case ya haven’t heard.) You’ll be all bundled up and prepared for any freezing wind that comes your way.  This ain’t your average Canadian tux, especially in this shade of forest green. So wintery! Keep the rest simple with a white long-sleeve tee and low-tops, and throw on a scarf if your neck gets chilly.  Elevate a black graphic tee, raw-hemmed jeans, and black booties, with a sophisticated burgundy faux-fur coat. Add a chain strap bag, and you’re ready for a night out on the town.  This silhouette is roomy enough for extra layers, so pile ’em on or just stick to a sweater and skirt if the temps aren’t quite freezing yet. Black ankle boots will go with anything, and you can always add tights if your legs get chilly.   Channel the ’70s in a corduroy number with rich brown boots and a croc-embossed bag. If your collarbones are shivering, zip this baby all the way up, or if you’re overheating, zip it down.  A leather jacket is a cold-weather staple. Jeans are an expected combination, but a pair of loose striped pants look just as good with the outerwear.  Minimalists will be obsessed with this combo. A light sweater with dark skinnies + black boots = a guaranteed cozy yet fashionable look.  Pick your fave color and then lean all the way into it with a gorgeous wine-red top, coordinating jeans, a brown belt, and croc-embossed boots.  FYI, you can also wear this guy as a dress or open as a regular ol’ cardigan! You might not want to take it off at the end of the day with the super-soft fabric and comfy balloon sleeves. Black boots—ankle-height or taller—completes the ensemble.  Okay, maybe denim under a maxi is a little outta your comfort zone, but doesn’t it look kinda good?! It’ll also help keep your legs from freezing when you’re outside. Or you can always opt to wear a floral maxi on its own with white boots, and throw on a shearling coat for peak winter vibes.  A non-black moto stands out from the rest, and when paired with a leopard-print top, jeans, and heeled boots, it makes a killer winter ’fit.  A plaid blazer is a classic, and you can button it all the way up to keep in the heat. With white jeans and a top, and animal-print kicks, it’s a super simple outfit to wear both in and out of the office.

			 Ssssssssssssssso chic. If you've recently shopped on the internet, or looked at any celebrity, you've probably noticed that snakeskin and snake print are kind of a big deal rn. You might be thinking, wow that looks cool on the models/celebs, but it's a pretty eye-catching pattern and I'm not sure if I can pull off that kind of statement. Well, you can, my friend.  Please, scroll on for some snake print F A C T S. That means you can wear it with literally any color, which is awesome, right? Even if you have more of a demure sense of style, you can start to slowly incorporate it in your day-to-day with accessories.  
 There is literally no reason not to wear snake print from head to toe, so if you're down, you should just go all in. It will look seriously awesome, I promise. 
 Neons, bright reds, and even multi colors—there's no hue the striking design doesn't look good in, so, yeah.

			 Finish the year off in a blaze of online shopping glory.   Well, folks, the holiday season has come and gone, but that doesn't mean the shopping is over. Nordstrom's huge half-yearly sale, in which items are up to 50 percent off, is happening now through January  2, so put all that Christmas money to good use and treat yourself to these insane deals!!!  A plaid blazer is so much more chic when it's made from a thick tweed material; it'll keep you warmer, while the pattern keeps you stylish.  Sparkly chandelier earrings might be just the thing that will take your outfit from "just OK" to "OMG, wow!"  If just one floral print doesn't do it for you, opt for a pretty flutter-sleeve dress with TWO flowery patterns.  Can't get enough of faux-shearling? Opt for a coat in the material that features cute multicolored stripes.  Make all your black and brown bags jealous by getting a mini crossbody in a standout yellow shade.   Who doesn't want a pair of best-selling jeans? These Good American ones are known for their amazingly soft feel and super skinny fit, and now you can snag them on sale for yourself.  A polka-dot button down midi dress is perfect for the office, while the breezy skirt and leg slits also make it great for after-work drinks.  You'll look so sophisticated with a delicate pendant chain around your neck; plus, with this one, you won't ever have to choose between silver and gold.  A knit sweater in a chic shade of winter white is one you'll want to wear all season long. As a bonus, the mock neck on this one protects against icy wind.   If turtlenecks are an integral part of your winter aesthetic get yourself a cute striped dress with the high neckline stat.  Animal print never truly goes away, but this year it's trending more than usual, so get in on it with a pair of stylish calf hair booties. While the pattern might seem bold, it's actually a versatile neutral  because of its black and brown hues.  If you're serious about finding a puffer jacket that traps in heat, but also doesn't make you look like a marshmallow, this insulated yellow one is perfect.  A wool cardigan that hits below the knee will make you feel cozy in cold weather, but it also looks cute over pajamas if you don't plan on leaving your apartment.  Jogger pants with an elastic waistband will make you want to ditch all your stiff jeans, but the print and colors of this pair still look elevated.  Combat boots are a wardrobe stable in any season, and a pair in white with black contrast will work well with jeans, a floral dress, or a corduroy skirt.  A metallic top will stand out from underneath any outerwear, while the ruffle sleeves give it a flirty touch.  A mini tote that can be worn as a top handle bag or a cross body will become your new favorite accessory.  If you can't get enough of knit dresses, opt for a long-sleeve one with cute button details at the shoulder.  Pair a black jumpsuit with sandals and a straw bag during summer—but once colder temps roll around, throw on black boots and a long-sleeve sweater underneath and it looks just as good.  Whether you love stacking jewelry on all your fingers or just like wearing one piece at a time, a rope ring is just the classic style you need. Considering how much it's popped up in literally every clothing store, corduroy is *the* material to wear this winter. If you're all about it, this sleek wine-colored coat is definitely for you.  An overall dress is a great piece to wear with all your winter sweaters underneath—dress it up with tights and boots or down with ankle socks and sneakers.  Black loafers are a classic footwear choice and go with any outfit, but if you want yours to feel special, opt for a pair that features embossed texture and a studded sole.

			 And you better believe I'll wear them after I give birth, too. Because I'd categorize myself as pretty fit before I got pregnant, I thought I'd be one of those people who'd be able to do a CrossFit or HIIT class with no problem. ALOL. Instead, as soon as I was six weeks along, I basically couldn't (and still can't, let's be honest) even breathe after walking up 10 steps from the subway platform to the street, and all I wanted do to was drink ginger ale and go to bed at 6pm. Ah, the things no one tells you before you get pregnant. Once the second trimester hit, though, I instantly started to feel better, and I could begin to mentally wrap my head around hitting the gym. I went to slip on a pair of my stretchiest yoga pants before my Ballet Beautiful session only to find that they did. Not. Fit. WTF do I do now? I thought. At that point I was showing a bit but definitely thought my spandex pants would have coddled my belly; instead, I felt like they were cutting off my air supply. Luckily, I had a leotard, some tights, and a pair of shorts that worked in a pinch. Post workout, I immediately asked our fitness editor for help. I explained my dilemma, and she told me I had to try Lululemon's Align Pant II leggings. She'd heard from other pregnant women that they're known for subtly stretching with their growing bellies. Really? I was skeptical but also desperate and down to try anything.  I ripped open the package to examine the leggings when they arrived a few days later. They looked like regular yoga pants, TBH, so I couldn't figure out why they were so magical—until I put them on that night. Turns out, my colleague WAS RIGHT. Here's why:  If you've yet to become pregnant, spoiler alert: Your skin might itch like crazy, so the last thing you want lying on your belly is a scratchy pair of yoga pants. But this material is beyond anything I've ever slipped on before. It's made from Lululemon's sweat-wicking, trademarked Nulu fabric that is "buttery-soft," as the website touts, and they're not fucking around. I swear, the leggings are legit so comfortable that I now understand why women just wear them around town while running errands. This means they feel like air (AKA barely there), and the waistband is like a built-in belly band that offers your bump the support it needs. Oh, and said band doesn't dig into your skin, leaving behind a lateral indentation like an equator that you think may never go away. Instead, the fabric gently hugs you—a reminder that it's got you without forcefully holding your torso hostage to the point where you feel like you can't breathe. I'm about to be nine months pregnant, and the pants STILL fit like a perfectly tailored, not-too-tight glove. After countless workout classes (my go-tos are prenatal yoga, Sweat With Bec, personal-training sessions with David Kirsch, and Ballet Beautiful), I've washed these pants a ton, and they've retained their vibrant black hue and soft-to-the-touch feel. (Just remember to follow the directions to machine wash them with like fabrics in a cold, gentle cycle, and lay them flat to dry.) Pregnant or not, I can't recommend these workout pants enough, and neither can other women: Since documenting my workouts on IG, other previously or currently expecting moms have DM'd me to rave about how they won't wear any other legging. And if there's one thing I've learned from being pregnant, it's to consider (and take) the advice of moms when they tell you the same thing en masse—because they know WTF they're talking about.

			 And wow, am I obsessed.   Remember last summer when Justin Bieber was running around New York City with then-girlfriend Hailey Baldwin wearing outfits like this?  Well, there’s your reminder. And if you’re not quite into his printed floral shirt, distressed jorts (lol, jorts), and pool slides, I’m here to tell you that you should probably reconsider. Why? Because right now, looking like a ’90s tourist—just short of accessorizing with a paper map—is the only way to dress. It’s also giving me major Rocket Power nostalgia, which is why I am SO on board with this whole trend. (That, and perhaps because I’m from Orlando, basically the tourism capital of the world thanks to Disney.)  But don’t believe that this is A Thing? Just take a look at the the spring/summer 2019 collections from some of these fashion designers:  
  So, yeah, the whole “dad on vacation” aesthetic is about to become more popular than ever. (And the Biebs is still very much its biggest fan.) It’s already popping up in all your fave stores, like Zara, Topshop, Revolve, Forever 21, ASOS, and more. What do you need to absolutely nail the tourist trend? Here’s the checklist:  
 Out of office, but make it fashion, amirite?! Now go out there this summer and wear your best bucket hat and Bermudas because...you know you want to.

			 Team USA wore uniforms by Ralph Lauren to the closing ceremony, and they're NOT cheap! The closing ceremony for the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea took place on Sunday night, and Team USA's athletes were there to celebrate in chic Ralph Lauren-designed uniforms — which, as Bustle notes, cost more than a gold medal.  Some of the Team USA collection is available on Ralph Lauren's website, so you don't have to be a ridiculously skilled Olympian to show your patriotism — although you might need a couple thousand dollars to get the complete look. Each Olympian wore a white bomber jacket, a color-block sweater ($495), navy track pants with red striping down the side ($398), brown boots ($995), beanies ($195), mittens ($135), and trendy bandanas ($125) — all with a red, white, and blue color scheme, naturally.   Featuring a vintage-inspired ski sweater and our innovative heated bomber jacket, take a closer look at the official Closing Ceremony uniforms for the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 worn by #TeamUSA. While sold out, watch this space for future iterations of our cutting edge heated technology. A post shared by  Polo Ralph Lauren (@poloralphlauren) on Feb 25, 2018 at 5:32pm PST Time reports that a gold medal from PyeongChang is valued at $577 when melted down as scrap metal, although if left intact it could be auctioned off for far more — for between $20,000 to $50,000 dollars. So each outfit (totaling $2,343, excluding the unknown cost of the jacket) is worth more than the equivalent of four gold medals at its scrap value.  According to Ralph Lauren, the nightly temperature in PyeongChang during this time of year can reach as low as 17 degrees Fahrenheit, so the brand's first priority is keeping the athletes warm with each piece. The opening-ceremony outfits differed slightly from those worn during the closing festivities, with the former taking on a more navy color scheme. The uniforms included jeans, knit beanies, Fair Isle sweaters, and suede fringe gloves embroidered with the Olympic rings and the American flag.   The official Opening Ceremony uniforms for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018 were unveiled moments ago on the @TODAYshow. Polo Ralph Lauren is proud to be an official outfitter of #TeamUSA and wish @AlexShibutani, @AjaLEvans, @MaiaShibutani, @GusKenworthy, @JamieAnderson, and @RicoSled23 the best of luck in the coming weeks.

			 And you need to jump on it now. Slowly but surely, and without you knowing it, chunky chain necklaces have come back in fashion and taken over your Instagram feed. It used to be about delicate, stackable thin chains, but the maximalist version is back and it looks pretty cool. You may remember this style from the ’80s and ’90s, when thick, juicy gold pieces reigned. The updated versions are a bit more sleek with more thoughtful designs. Take a look:   the parker collection features chunkier chain links that are perfect for catching the sun's rays ☀️ your new 24/7 accessories? we think yes 😉 A post shared by  gorjana (@gorjana) on May 28, 2019 at 7:55am PDT  Now, because I have you captive, let’s just scroll through a bunch of pretty chain necklace ideas from the ’gram.  ✨ A post shared by  lili_claspe (@lili_claspe) on Apr 25, 2019 at 7:42am PDT Oooh.  on wednesdays we wear the parker necklace✨ A post shared by  gorjana (@gorjana) on Aug 14, 2019 at 8:50am PDT Aaah.

			 After skipping a season, the singer/designer is returning to the NYFW calendar.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. If last season's New York Fashion Week calendar seemed less exciting, it's probably because it was missing Rihanna riding a dirt-bike down the runway. But good news for this September: the singer/designer is making a return to NYFW after sitting last season out.  As WWD reports, not only is Bad Gal Riri slated to show during this season's schedule, she's actually serving as the grand finale of the week. Unlike her previous runways in New York and Paris, she's showing without Puma this time.  Instead, Rihanna will host a Savage x Fenty event, bringing her collection of lingerie to the New York Fashion Week scene for the first time. The presentation, which is set to be an "immersive experience," is slated to take place in Brooklyn at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, September 12, following the Marc Jacobs show at 6:00 PM. Rihanna closing out NYFW in lingerie? Yes, please.  The Savage x Fenty presentation will be shown in a see-now, buy-now format and available to shop immediately at SavageX.com and a series of pop-up shops this fall.  Bad & BOUjee ✖️| @shabakaaa serving #BLACKWIDOW in the Sheer Marabou Romper A post shared by  SAVAGE X FENTY BY RIHANNA (@savagexfenty) on Aug 20, 2018 at 9:01pm PDT Upon its brand launch in May, the Savage x Fenty website instantly crashed several times due to such high-demand. Featuring bras, underwear, furry robes, and more, Rihanna's line of lingerie and intimate accessories was heralded not only for being affordable, but for being inclusive in terms of sizing. Along with featuring a diverse lineup of models, the collection also boasted a wide range of nude shade options for all skin tones in both bras and underwear. SHOP MORE SAVAGE x FENTY LINGERIE NOW

			  Some. Of. These. Jeans. Are. Only. $36!! Never underestimate the power of great jeans, especially from a brand like Levi’s, known for its cult-favorite styles. The clothing company checks off all the boxes for a fab pair of denim—soft, stylish, and a hint of stretch all at an affordable price.  As if you needed another reason to love Levi’s, Amazon is currently having a low-key sale on some of the brand’s most popular styles. Simply search for Levi’s on the site and you’ll find everything from a straight-leg pair to classic skinny jeans and a boot-cut option that will look amazing with your new booties for fall.

			 You have to see this clip. BFFs Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid have a new campaign together with DSquared2, and in the photos and videos released on Wednesday, they make it clear that they hate buttoning up their shirts. You'll see what I mean. The ads envision Kendall and Bella as cowgirl outlaw-types with hair chock-full of secrets. They check into a '60s-era Midwest motel, and a bunch of dudes come over for a steamy night of motel-room fun — in which, again, hardly anyone wears a buttoned-up shirt.  DSquared2 posted a partial clip of the video to Instagram, but you can check out the full short film on the brand's website, if you want. The vibes of the campaign mimic the fall/winter 2018 designs DSquared2 showed at Fashion Week, including western tops with embroidered yoke details, super tight jeans, and these cowboy boot sandals, which are really something: Anyway, back to the campaign: It also includes pictures! There are a few of Bella, and one of Kendall in a red jacket with some major sleeve action.   Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 These are some hot pics. Just dropping by to quickly say that Kate Upton looks like a total knockout-smokeshow-bombshell of a human in her latest lingerie campaign. The pics are from an Italian brand called Yamamay, which also carries swimwear. In this first one, she sports a flower-patterned set that's perfect for spring! And in another, she wears a classic, white lace look. Head over here to see even more of these pics if you want! Aaaaaand, I just realized my lingerie game is seriously lackluster.

			 The Fug Girls look at who rocked the red carpet. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.   Twitter loudly wondered whether Timothée Chalamet had arrived at the Globes by pulling someone's carriage, or parachuting, or any number of things a person might do in a harness. So the folks at Louis Vuitton officially clarified that he is, in fact, wearing an “embroidered bib.” We're not sure that brings much clarity to the question of why he’d wear such a thing, but it means we can put away our jokes about whether he broke into Christian Grey’s Red Room. (Don't worry, those will keep.) Now THAT is how you make an entrance, especially when you’re on a show called Pose. This ensemble took six months to make, and it was worth every single one of them.  Seriously, what can we even say anymore? There is no flaw in this person. She can wear anything. Thandie, listen, if you’d like to test that theory and hit up the rest of the season’s ceremonies in something batshit, please do—we live for that stuff. But we’re pretty sure you’d pull it off as coolly as you do this. This is the apex of perfection. It's also excellent news is that she won wearing this—which means, thanks to the victory pics, it's going to live on for a very long time (beyond just inside our hearts). We applaud Sofia Carson, an up-and-comer who’s fronting the Pretty Little Liars spinoff The Perfectionists, for reaching big on such a huge night. But this dress might’ve eluded her confident grasp just a bit. There’s a gorgeous idea here, although it has about five flourishes too many. We do love her hair, though.   To be clear, there is nothing dismal about Kiki Layne. She is a dream. But the number of people who theoretically had to sign off on this dishwater Dior is probably pretty long, and that is mind-boggling. Luckily, she's got a lot of red carpets ahead of her, and there's nowhere to go but up. Much as this can’t decide if it wants to be a dress or pants, we can’t totally settle on whether we like it. On one hand, the cut is unerring, and it’s the most successful unusual outfit Julia Roberts has worn in a while. But we’re worried the barrage of beige ends up washing Julia out, which—when you’re a Major Movie Star like she is—should be really hard to do.   We did actually assume she would have some competition in this category, but then Amy Sherman-Palladino went and left her signature topper at home. Still, we love the chutzpah of showing up in a gold lamé lid, and the fact that everything below it is exactly what we have come to rely on from Janelle Monáe: wholly original, hard to parse in simple sentences, and beyond regally deployed. Yes, this is a bit of a cheat, because Sandra Oh didn't wear this on the red carpet. But of the array of looks she wore as Golden Globes host—did you see her killer gold sleeves when she won her award?!—this is the arguably the best. It’s beautiful, tailored to perfection, and meant we had something fantastic to marinate in whenever the opening patter with Andy Samberg veered south. Emma Stone’s gentle pink Louis Vuitton was good, but all hail the Queen: Olivia Colman’s sparkles and cape and rich red lip captivated us—and when she stood between her co-stars onstage, she was the focus of it all. Nicole Kidman looks FANTASTIC in this wine-hued, sequined number—sexy, sophisticated, self-assured. It's a shame that someone on her team decided to undercut the overall effect by plonking a twee black velvet bow on the back of her head. No one looks at a slinky formal gown and thinks, "You know who this reminds me of? PRINCESS CHARLOTTE." This is big, bold, and brave—an unusual choice for a woman who might have been tempted to show up at this event dressed more like a stereotypical CW ingénue. She pulls it off with élan.  It's emblematic of Gaga's extremely crazy, meat-dress-checked sartorial past that we almost considered this understated. The woman has blue hair, and the train of her dress would fill a compact car to the brim; her sleeves are larger than two Christmas hams. It's only understated in a vacuum. But strip away the extraneous volume, and it's basically not much more than a bridesmaid's dress, and we hoped for more.  Formal leather is a tall order, and Michelle Yeoh carries it admirably. But the real star of the show is, once again, the exceptional emerald ring from her personal collection that she loaned to Crazy Rich Asians and wore again tonight. It's only fair—the piece is as much a part of the cast as any human being was and has earned its own seat at the table.   Anne Hathaway started working with stylist Law Roach last year—you may know him from his tenure with Zendaya and Céline Dion—and he has worked magic on her wardrobe. This is sassy and sexy, a world of personality. This spangled blue number makes Lupita Nyong'o look like she's dancing even when she's standing still. And when she does move? Magic. Random bejeweled bras have their place in the world, but atop a Disney princess dress is not one of them.  Listen, this should not be good. It's secret shorts. This is a high degree of difficulty, because it seems unnecessary with that great, complex train. So it's a testament to Gemma Chan's inherent chicness that she's working it. Or are we just blinded by the great red lip? Either way: Carry on.   This dress' shape is similar to everything that Penélope Cruz has ever worn on a major awards show red carpet; she loves a big skirt/bare shoulders pairing. But given that she went into business with Chanel as a brand ambassador back in July, color us surprised that this isn't the work of Karl Lagerfeld. This dress is good, sure, but we're not sure it's worth a tongue-lashing from the Kaiser. We love that Judy Greer went in a tuxedo direction, and judging by Twitter, we’re not the only ones applauding Cody Fern’s androgynous ensemble. Women have been turning to formal suits more often, and menswear has blessedly branched out from the standard-issue tux; here’s to making 2019 the year everyone keeps pushing the boundaries of what’s been taught as conventional.  Visit the Fug Girls on their website, or follow them on Twitter. Their book, The Royal We, is available here.

			 Are you even surprised? Let's get straight to it: A sexy wedding dress costume inspired by Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown exists and you just have to see it for yourself:   E-retailer Yandy—known for its steamy pop-culture Halloween ideas that can definitely miss the mark on political and social issues—is the brand behind the product, which is officially called "Yandy American Princess Costume." I'll just let this description from the website speak for itself: In the photos, the model is also pictured with a bouquet, a man's blazer, and a Deal or No Deal-inspired metal case, so, like, if you couldn't tell who they were going for by the title, you get the hint with the props. Unforch, those extras are not included in the costume package. The whole thing retails for $49.95 and you can do with that information what you will! As a much-needed reminder, here's what Meghan actually looked like on her wedding day: Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 For an inexpensively ~steamy~ holiday. You don't have to spend a ton of money to have a sexy Valentine's Day. Shop these fun, fresh styles for $20 or less. This longline bra and $16 high-waisted thong set is full of sultry surprises like velvet insets, cutouts, and sheer lace paneling. Sometimes you wanna be sultry, but you also want to keep it simple. This stretch-lace two-piece set lets you do both. Are there any lingerie colors more flirty than black and red?  If this two-tone babydoll has anything to say about it, nope! This strappy bralette and sheer miniskirt set is practically a steal. Whoever thinks miniskirts aren't for the bedroom is clearly wrong. If athleisure is your brand of sexy, you'll want to grab this cute set, with its sports bra-esque top and high-waisted knickers. OK—this super cute, boned chemise is more than $20, so I'm sorry, but at $35, FashionNova is still practically giving it away. Who wouldn't want to snag this amazing find at that price?   If you love underboob, you'll love this velvet-and-lace bra and panty set. Name something more fun than this sheer burgundy babydoll with a suggestive slit. I'll wait. How gorgeous is the burgundy embroidery on this bralette-and-thong duo?  You're a gift, so your partner should probably unwrap you from this bow-themed situation this Valentine's Day. Nothing's more classic than a red lace babydoll—grab this one for $20.  If you like a fitted design and a plunging neckline, this black design is definitely the piece for you. Can't go wrong with a red silk slip with see-through details. Get you a bodysuit that can do both—slay in the sheets and work as a cute top for a fun night on the town. Really not sure how this ultra skin-showing black lace piece is only $4, but it has five-star reviews, so get on it if it's your thing!

			 If you love statement pieces, then you need these. I love jewelry, especially the dangly kind (must be the Gemini in me), which is why it's so soul-crushing that I normally have to stick to small studs. As much as I love heavy statement earrings, they're a pain in the ear and, frankly, aren't worth it. But recently, someone put me onto Levears Earring Lifts, and now I have to share them with y'all because they're great. Here's why: Overall, these lifts will save your ears from the weight of heavy earrings. Made with a "patented stabilizer technology," each back features a little hook or "curl" on top for optimal support. To wear them, fasten one to the post as you normally would, then rotate until it feels most comfortable for your ear. Take note, though: These work best on earrings with posts, not those with screws or hooks. I'm estimating here, but the Levears look at least three times the size of a normal earring back. This makes so much sense—why would you use the same thing for a giant dangler as you would a small stud? Genius. 
  Have you ever taken off your earrings as soon as you got to your destination because that was all your lobes could handle? Then you've probably also tried waiting until you've arrived to put them on. I'm guilty of both—but not anymore. These make it tolerable to wear heavy accessories for hours. I may still change my shoes when I get to work but I don't have to switch my earrings, and for that I'm grateful. Earrings, IMO, are the headbands of jewelry in terms of the amount of time you have before you get a headache and need to take them off. I performed my own little experiment and compared what it felt like to wear my favorite lucite hoops with and without the Levears from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on two separate work days. I took off my earrings four times throughout the day when I wore the normal back but didn't remove them once with the Levears. Did they still feel heavy? Yes, because they are. But the backs helped distribute the weight so that not just my piercing was feeling the pressure of the weight.  The stainless steel backs are a bargain at $25, coming out to $6.25 a pair. If you have sensitive skin, you can also shop sterling silver, gold plated, 14k white gold, or 14k yellow gold options. All that to say, if you too need a little extra support, try these babies. You won't believe your ears.

			 You should probably pay attention to this. All these years, I thought when I was outside wearing a T-shirt, I was "covered"—as in protected from the sun—but turns out, that's a big ole lie I was telling myself and you need to know about it too. According to dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor of dermatology at Yale University, you can get hella burned and sun-damaged, even while wearing a standard tee. "T-shirts have an SPF of about 5 or 6—very little. And the thinner and lighter color-wise the shirt is, the less SPF it has," she says.  If you're over here thinking, "Whatever, that's not a big deal," I'm not here to scare you, but I am here to set you straight: You could still get skin cancer if you're only covered by cotton or any other light fabric. "I've had patients who have said they didn't go to tanning booths, they were good about their sunscreen, and they've got freckles down their back—this is the only thing [their cancer condition] could be attributed to," Dr. Gohara says. "T-shirts are not going to cut it." Basically, it'll say so. Regular sunscreen is rated on an SPF, or Sun Protection Factor, scale. That means it protects your skin from burning and can also block harmful UV rays. Protective clothing is rated on a UPF, or Ultraviolet Protection Factor, scale, which is basically another way of saying it's shielding you from the most harmful, cancer-causing UV rays. Clothing with a UPF of 50 or higher is great, but manufacturers also make clothing at lower UPFs. Often, you'll find these indices on athletic styles, like leggings, or moisture-wicking zip-ups, and swimwear and rash guards often have it (although they don't always). Day-to-day garments, like blouses and dresses, don't typically come with a UPF rating. It isn't chemically treated or anything—it's just fabric that's been woven tight enough that light can't shine through, according to Dr. Gohara. The easiest way to tell if your clothing is actually protective is just to buy clothing with a rating attached—it should be easily seen on a label. Some fabrics, like denim, are generally woven tight enough and are thick enough to actually block UV rays. Go jeans! Good news! Some laundry aids can add extra protection to your clothing!! "You can add them to your favorite T-shirts," Gohara says. These detergents add microscopic crystals to your clothing so that the rays can't penetrate them.  Those have UPF indices too, and the wider the brim, the better, because you gotta protect those ears. "It's not easy to apply sunscreen to the part in your hair, and that's a place I've found many skin cancers," Dr. Gohara says. So now you're armed with all the knowledge. Get out there and enjoy the sun, but be safe while you're doing it, okay?

			 Turns out there's a reason Meghan wears her shoes a size larger! Women in the royal family live their lives in the spotlight, so it makes sense that they have go-to fashion tricks that they use for formal events—no one wants a wardrobe malfunction on their hands! Here, 11 genius hacks that have helped  Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, and Princess Diana pull off their most stylish ensembles.  Obsessed with the royal fam? Subscribe here! Princess Di used her clutches to cover her cleavage as she got out of cars. Why? It prevented any prying photographers from snapping a revealing pic of her.  Even her go-to handbag designer Anya Hindmarch famously called them "cleavage clutches." Opt for a classic structured clutch with this navy style.  This sparkly one also has a strap so you can wear it as a crossbody.  It's no secret that part of royal protocol for women is to wear pantyhose, but the smooth material can make it easy for their feet to slide out.  Kate Middleton's have silicone pads so that they stick to the inside of her high heels. Apparently, she's a fan of the brand John Lewis.  Kate's favorite pantyhose can now be yours! Here's another non-slip option that looks like a second skin.  More formal public occasions sometimes call for hats, and I'm sure you've wondered at some point how they even stay on—especially the larger, wide-brimmed ones.  Reportedly, Princess Diana's had combs inside them that secured to her hair so they stayed put. Hidden but useful!  If you're a fascinator-loving lady, these combs'll keep your headwear in place. These guys are also helpful if you want to keep your hair out of your face.  In this image, Kate makes a fashionable case for the chic hairnet. She often wears them when her hair is styled in more intricate updos—that way she doesn't have any rogue fly-aways.  Here, she wore one again over her low bun at the 2019 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey.  Hate loose hairs in your updos? Give Kate's trick a try! Another tip? Match it to your hair color so it's barely noticeable.  Another go-to fashion hack royals use to stop wardrobe malfunctions is adding weights to their skirts and dresses. Although it seems that this method isn't always used, as evidenced here by Kate's flying-skirt moment at Princess Eugenie's wedding in October 2018.  Stewart Parvin, one of Queen Elizabeth's couturiers, told the Daily Mail that he sews small lead weights (used for curtains!) into the hems of her clothes, which prevents her skirt from blowing up in the wind.  Never have a Marilyn moment ever again with these small weighted stickies. Or you can DIY it like HRH, get these drapery weights, and attach them to your skirts.  Another way royals prevent their outfits from billowing in the wind is by choosing thicker fabrics and more fitted silhouettes, like Kate's tweed blazer-and-skirt set pictured here. A-line silhouettes have a greater chance of flying up in the wind, but a sheath dress like this will prevent any breezy malfunction.  Make like Kate in a tweed dress with that looks like two separate pieces.  Or opt for a fun polka-dot print with this structured frock.  According to fashion expert Harriet Davey, going up a shoe size is a style hack employed by many celebrities. It looks like Meghan used this trick in this photo, as there's lots of room at her heel in these strappy Aquazzura pumps. "Celebs often go a size up, or even two, in the shoe department when they're at an event or on the red carpet, and it's for one reason we can all relate to—to avoid blisters," she said in an interview with The Sun.  Copy Meghan's kicks with these neutral heels that tie up the ankle. Or opt for some similar black pumps in a half-size or full-size up.  Meghan looked super fashion-forward (like she always does, TBH) when she stepped out in this Alexander McQueen suit in February 2018. But perhaps more notable than her chic pantsuit was the fact that her white blouse was actually a BODYSUIT (!!!) by the brand Tuxe.  It seems like Meg has actually worn the style on more than one occasion. She slipped into a sleeveless cashmere one by the same label to celebrate the publication of Together: Our Community Cookbook in September 2018. Leave tops that ride up in the dust and get this blousy bodysuit instead! Going for a more casual look? Snag this black one with cute buttons down the front and pair it with jeans.  Speaking of bodysuits, etiquette expert Myka Meier said in an interview with The Sun that Kate and Meghan often "wear bodysuits and clothes that actually increase static so it’s much hard[er] for something to fly up."  It achieves a similar result like weighted hems, but in a more wearable form. Although it's just a guess, it seems likely Meghan might have worn one underneath this breezy pleated Self-Portrait dress in April 2018.  Hate it when your dress unexpectedly flies up? Then nab this navy style.   This gray one has a super low back: Helpful if you're wearing something backless over it or it's sexy all by itself.  Another speculation is that Meghan's signature low, messy bun makes it easier to wear her hair down for other events later in the day. Her loose updo doesn't cause those annoying hair "dents" like a tighter hairstyle would.  According to Byrdie UK, "a low bun is like a form of damage control. Markle can wear one all day and then quickly unwind it—letting her loose waves fall beyond her shoulders, ready for the evening's function." These bun bobby pins will help you achieve your own royal updo! Similar to the hairnet, get yourself some pins that match your hair so they'll easily blend in.  Royal functions mean wearing fancy attire, and that usually means wearing heels for women. Kate Middleton spends a LOT of time in sky-high footwear.  This is why she's reportedly a fan of Alice Bow leather insoles, which add extra cushiony padding to any shoe. They come with double-sided sticky areas to really hold them in place.  Make your feet happy with a pair of leather inserts that will ease the pain of heels. These come in multiple colors too!  While these are super thin, it delivers on major cushion so your feet aren't aching by the end of the day.

			 *Grabs popcorn.*  Just one year ago, Monica Rose was the Kardashian-Jenner clan's go-to stylist, but they parted ways under very dramatic and mysterious circumstances. Now, it seems like the stylist, who was known for shaping the Kar-Jenner style into what it is today, has moved on and is working with none other than Sofia Richie.  You know, the 19-year-old who is dating Kourtney Kardashian's ex Scott Disick.  It's amazing how things come full circle. Turns out Sofia is in Míkonos vacationing with Disick, and worked with Rose to come up with the above fuchsia ensemble featuring an Alexandre Vauthier mini dress, black sandals, and a matching shoulder bag. Rose had worked for the Kardashian-Jenner fam, mainly Khloé, Kim, Kylie, and Kendall, since 2007, when she first met Kim on a fashion shoot, but was dropped after a decade of working together. People reported that the whole *klan* even unfollowed her on Instagram after the split.  Rose's new working relationship with Richie comes after the Kardashians parted ways with another longtime partner, makeup artist Joyce Bonelli, in June. At the time, she was promptly unfollowed by the Kardashian sisters on Instagram, and there was rampant speculation she was fired. She hit back with a post in which she wore a robe that read, "F**k with me I DARE YOU."  Now, she's refuted the rumors, telling People she's never been fired:  Bonelli also added the caveat: “Who hasn’t gotten in a fight with their girlfriends?”  Kim split with former assistant Stephanie Shepherd in 2017 too, after working with her for four years. It does seem, though, that Shephard is back on good terms with the famous family now. Drama, drama, drama.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 In interviews with Cosmopolitan.com, friends explain just how much Markle leans on her best friend and stylist Jessica Mulroney. In August 2016, Meghan Markle jetted off to the Amalfi Coast for a whirlwind girls’ trip with her BFF, stylist Jessica Mulroney. The women, both in their 30s, sipped negronis and white wine and lounged poolside at Le Sirenuse, a cliffside resort to the stars. They snapped carefree selfies from behind Holly Eyewear sunglasses, a boutique Canadian brand, tagging their photos #MJxItaly for maximum Instagram follow-ability. The images of Mulroney and Markle smiling in the bright Italian sun betrayed no signs of the royally juicy secret they carried: Just one month earlier, Markle went on first-date drinks with her future husband-to-be, Prince Harry, and the couple was quickly falling in love. Mulroney knew about the budding romance “before anyone else,” royals reporter Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love, tells Cosmopolitan.com. But she’s “both loyal and discreet, and Meghan really valued that.” Mulroney's quiet influence on Markle's style has a net value of about $212 million. Nearly two years and one royal engagement later, Mulroney has proven to be more than just a trusted confidant: As Markle’s unofficial style advisor, the Canadian public relations-maven has helped mold the former actress into one of the most influential fashion icons in the world. Since Markle gained global fame as Harry’s girlfriend, Mulroney hasn’t publicly spoken about her bestie’s royal relationship. But now, multiple sources close to both women reveal new insight into the pair’s friendship and just how much Markle turns to Mulroney as a right-hand woman. Not only has Markle adopted a very similar fashion aesthetic to her BFF, but she also has asked her for all sorts of lifestyle advice, from yoga teachers to favorite manicurists. (Representatives for Mulroney did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.) That influence will be front and center at Markle’s May 19 nuptials, where Mulroney's twin sons Brian and John, 7, and daughter Ivy, 4, will serve in the bridal party, Kensington Palace confirmed. The future royal has leaned on Mulroney, who touched down in London on Wednesday, for months as an “unofficial wedding planner,” consulting over the phone and attending dress fittings, says Nicholl. “She helped Meghan choose the dress designer and is helping with all the details of the wedding planning behind the scenes.” Mulroney's quiet influence on Markle’s style, dubbed “The Markle Effect” or “The Markle Sparkle” by the press, has a net value of about $212.1 million, according to Women’s Wear Daily. Mulroney’s friends aren't surprised by the impact.  “Jess has come up with style concepts for me ranging from the Grammys red carpet [looks] to casual shoots at home with my family,” Canadian television journalist Tracy Moore, a close friend of Mulroney’s, tells Cosmopolitan.com. “She’s the one you want in your corner for any and all fashion opportunities.” Mulroney, born in 1980, fell in love with style around age 6, she told the Globe and Mail in a 2016 profile. Fashion is also in her genes: Mulroney is the great-granddaughter of Benjamin Brownstein, the founder of luxury Canadian retailer Browns Shoes.  After graduating from McGill University, Mulroney worked for her father, Stephen, a clothing manufacturer, before teaming up with her sister, Elizabeth, to start a sleepwear and lingerie distribution company. The siblings even garnered the Canadian rights to luxury lingerie brands like La Perla and Cosabella, according to a 2017 Toronto Life profile.  The successful move eventually led to a conversation with Bonnie Brooks, the former CEO of Canadian retail business group Hudson’s Bay Company in Toronto. The pair discussed a role for Mulroney overseeing a lingerie section for brides at the Canadian location of Kleinfeld, the boutique made famous by TLC’s reality show Say Yes to the Dress, but Mulroney “wanted a bigger role,” so Brooks placed her in the Kleinfeld's marketing department, according to Toronto Life. The store opened in spring 2014.  Shop Meghan’s White-Hot Ensemble “I got so excited about the idea of this bridal salon,” Mulroney told the Globe and Mail. “There was nothing like that in Canada. So quickly, I jumped into the bridal business.” Through her own 2008 marriage to Ben Mulroney, a TV host and the eldest son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Mulroney landed connections to big-time Canadian personalities, like Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Tracy Moore, who proved vital in furthering her career as a bridal, fashion, and lifestyle consultant. “Ben is a star in Canada, and for a long time Jess was always Ben’s wife, but she’s worked really hard to create a name for herself,” TV host Jessi Cruickshank, who met Mulroney through Ben in 2014, tells Cosmopolitan.com. “Even before this whole Meghan Markle thing ... she’s a hustler and has always been working and been an influencer.”  Today, Mulroney has 114,000 followers on her perfectly curated Instagram account to Ben's 27,800. Although Mulroney has carefully crafted her image, she bequeaths the spotlight when lending her bridal and fashion expertise to high-profile friends, like Markle. Much like the royal wedding, Mulroney unofficially helped style Cruickshank for her 2014 wedding and introduced her to big names in the bridal industry, like the maker of her dress, designer Mark Zunino. “She knows everybody in fashion, especially in bridal, and is this connecting factor for people,” says Cruickshank. “When she found out I was getting married, it was almost like she was getting married all over again — she was so excited to help me with every single aspect of my wedding.” Former Bachelorette star Kaitlyn Bristowe met Mulroney at a sunny April photo shoot in Jamaica for Wedding Vacations magazine, where the style expert is a contributing editor. Bristowe, who appears in the forthcoming July issue, says Mulroney didn't “miss a beat” when it came to on-set styling: “She has a laid-back, easygoing personality that makes you feel comfortable.”    Markle isn’t the only big name to give Mulroney’s work a global platform. The stylist helped put Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, on the radar of international designers. According to Toronto Life, on a 2015 double date at Toronto hotspot Buca, Grégoire Trudeau and Mulroney first discussed the sartorial demands of being a political spouse and the attention that would be paid to Trudeau’s upcoming swearing-in-ceremony. Mulroney helped her choose a white trench-style coat by Canadian brand Sentaler and a navy dress from Quebecois designer Erdem. Grégoire Trudeau’s decision to promote Canadian style made her immensely popular among the fashion set and won immediate favor in the media for putting her country's designers in the global spotlight, with CBC calling her “Canada's latest fashion icon.” At the time, Grégoire Trudeau told the Globe and Mail: “I never expected the level of reaction.”   Mulroney’s own wardrobe, awash in bold colors, textured fabrics, and draped jackets, is often Canadian-designed. And she’s always searching for new local designers for herself and her clients — even unofficial ones like Grégoire Trudeau — says Aleks Susak, a Canadian designer who dresses Grégoire Trudeau and works with Mulroney. “Her work as a stylist with Sophie Trudeau and other personalities has resulted in the international promotion of Canadian brands,” Susak tells Cosmopolitan.com. “At no other time in the history of Canadian fashion have Canadian brands received as much attention as they do today, largely due to the efforts of style influencers like Jessica.” Colleagues say it's clear from her impact on Grégoire Trudeau that Mulroney doesn't simply blindly select pretty patterns: She’s very conscious of the sartorial message an item of clothing sends. “She’s obviously so much more than a stylist, she’s a strategist,” Rachel Goldrick, editor of Wedding Vacations, tells Cosmopolitan.com. “She’s a PR guru, extremely plugged in, and is connected to amazing collaborator and designers.” Now, the world is seeing that strategy play out on the global stage. Markle and Mulroney met and bonded over a shared love for yoga when the actress moved to Toronto in 2011 to film Suits, according to Nicholl. “In Canada, the entertainment and fashion world is pretty small,” says Cruickshank. “I know Meghan was often out and about at parties and at Soho House, and everybody in that world bumps into each other and knows each other.” “They went to the same yoga and Pilates and became firm friends,” says Nicholl. “Meghan really looks up to Jessica. She thinks she’s a talented person, a wonderful mother, and a great best friend.” The two worked out in the same gym, shared a hairdresser and manicurist, and “hung out all the time,” adds Nicholl. “For years, she styled herself on Jessica.” In 2013, Markle’s marriage to film producer and talent manager Trevor Engelson ended, and she began to blog more on her now-defunct lifestyle site, The Tig. Amanda Dishaw, editor of royal fashion blog Meghan’s Mirror, tells Cosmopolitan.com that Mulroney’s fashion influence on Markle was clear on the site. Get Meghan’s Moto-Chic Outfit “Meghan began producing a lot of content on her lifestyle blog The Tig about feeling good about herself and promoting self-love,” says Dishaw, who shares mutual friends with Mulroney. “That’s when we started to see Meghan sharing her fashion online and incorporating Jessica’s themes into her style.” Many of Markle’s looks on The Tig were heavily “French-inspired,” adds Dishaw, with influences from Emmanuelle Alt, the editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris known for her skinny-fit pants, collared button-down shirts, and blazers. For years, she styled herself on Jessica. “Meghan used to say she loved that look, because it’s not too try-hard — polished but not perfect,” she says. “It was heavily influenced by Jessica, who rubbed off on Meghan like that in a lot of ways. Like, for instance, draping a leather jacket over the shoulder with the arms not put through and promoting Canadian fashion.” When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle confirmed their engagement in England on November 27, 2017, Harry sported a classic navy suit, and Markle was elegantly draped in a winter-white wrap from Line the Label and sparkling Les Plaisirs de Birks yellow and opal earrings. The coat, now appropriately named “The Meghan” by Line the Label, sold out immediately after Markle debuted it, and Birks confirmed a 500 percent spike in online traffic to their site, according to the New York Times. Both pieces come from Canadian labels that “Jessica has longstanding relationships with,” says Dishaw. “Over the last few years, everything that Meghan has worn … it’s all bought by Jessica as a stylist, and then Meghan wears it afterwards.” Copy Meghan’s Engagement Look According to Dishaw, the personalized gold “love” necklace by Maya Brenner, which Markle wore while out in Toronto in December 2016 and bore the initials M and H, was purchased by Mulroney at a retail location. It was then provided to Markle to wear.  “Before Meghan moved to London and set up her new life as a royal, Jessica likely also worked directly with brands to get pieces for Meghan to wear,” explains Dishaw, “Things are largely vetted through Jessica for public events.”  Though there are similarities between the styles of Markle and Mulroney, there are a few notable differences.  “[Mulroney has] a really great style of her own that’s a little bit more risqué than Meghan, with deeper Vs to show off more cleavage,” Dishaw says. “But she still likes the big-buttoned shirts and skinny jeans and great ankle boots.”    Markle and Mulroney were inseparable during the actress' time in Toronto. They attended yoga classes together, charity events, fancy dinners, Toronto Blue Jays games and booked all-girls vacations, like the Amalfi trip.   Mulroney was a guest when Markle accompanied Harry to an official royal appearance for the first time at the Invictus Games in Toronto in 2017, one year after the Italy jaunt. To avoid paparazzi, the Mulroneys reportedly had the couple over for dinner so they could keep out of the public eye, an unnamed source told E! “A decade of friendship and being instrumental in giving the couple the space and privacy to date and get to know each other position Jessica to be a trusted and seasoned advisor on the many decisions surrounding the planning of the wedding,” close friend and wedding dress designer Veronica Di Santo tells Cosmopolitan.com. Shop Meghan’s Striped Outfit Harry has gotten to know the Mulroneys, too, including their three young children. “Ivy especially is a big fan,” the source told E! “She, of course, has no idea that he’s a prince though.” The 4-year-old, who has modeled with her mom for a Birks campaign, will appear as a bridesmaid and her 7-year-old twin brothers, Brian and John, will be  page boys on Saturday.  When Markle left Canada for good to move in with Harry, Nicholl says “the hardest thing about leaving Toronto for Meghan was leaving Jessica.” But it’s clear the pair will remain close and will prioritize trips across the pond. This week's is perhaps the biggest — Mulroney and her family arrived in London on Wednesday to make wedding preparations. Just two days to go.

			 Turns out there's a reason Meghan wears her shoes a size larger! Women in the royal family live their lives in the spotlight, so it makes sense that they have go-to fashion tricks that they use for formal events—no one wants a wardrobe malfunction on their hands! Here, 11 genius hacks that have helped  Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, and Princess Diana pull off their most stylish ensembles.  Obsessed with the royal fam? Subscribe here! Princess Di used her clutches to cover her cleavage as she got out of cars. Why? It prevented any prying photographers from snapping a revealing pic of her.  Even her go-to handbag designer Anya Hindmarch famously called them "cleavage clutches."

			 My obsession with stripes lead me down a rabbit hole I never expected.  You know that feeling when your crush makes eye contact with you, and your heart skips a beat? Yeah, that's how I feel when I see a really fucking cute striped shirt. Whenever I'm combing through online sales, I immediately stop scrolling at the sight of those sweet, sweet horizontal and vertical lines.  I can't pinpoint when my obsession began, but I was in middle school when I noticed my closet was filled with the pattern. I fully leaned into it in high school, hitting up the mall and sending photos of my purchases to my friend Michaela, texting her along the lines of, "STRIPES AGAIN" or, "Surprise! Bought more stripes LOL." 
 I wanted to get to the root of my fixation and find out why so many of us lean on the same style all the time, so I turned to fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen, a teacher at the Fashion Institute of Technology and founder of the Fashion Psychology Institute, to learn what it all means. And wow, was it eye-opening. Here's what's actually going on when you wear the same thing alllllll the time:  First up, Karen asked if I was allowed to pick out what I wanted to wear when I went shopping with my parents as a kid. While that usually was the case, my mom *did* override my more unreasonable choices (i.e., buying a dress in the middle of winter).  "The one thing that I find significant is that you were allowed to select your clothing in middle school, so you were able to foster a sense of independence, but you just happened to fall back to the same pattern," she said. "I have a theory for this—it’s called Repetitious Wardrobe Complex."  Repetitious Wardrobe Complex: when someone wears the same outfit to minimize anxiety.  In other words, Karen says someone who is constantly drawn to the same style is minimizing their anxiety or that feeling that of, "I have nothing to wear."  So when did this start, and...am I in a style rut? Karen says fashion dependencies like this begin in childhood, which adds up, because I started wearing stripes when I was a kid: "Whether it’s your favorite color or whatever, it's [always] something significant that’s etched in your memory that gives you a visceral reaction." Next up, Karen assigned me some emotional homework to really explore my reason for picking out the same pattern every time. It might have been because of this Repetitious Wardrobe Complex, but I wanted to see if there was anything else at play that determined why I would pick out stripes. Ever find yourself repeating the same wardrobe choices? Give this exercise a try, too.    Karen has coined two phrases for the emotional reasons behind our wardrobe choices: Mood Illustration Dress and Mood Enhancement Dress. Basically, the first means you're indicating your feelings with your clothing, and the second signals that you're dressing in a particular way to lift your spirits. When I did my homework, I realized wearing stripes had a tangible positive impact on my emotional state. I felt happier and more confident when I was wearing them as opposed to not. "You’re actually using the stripes subconsciously to empower yourself," Karen says. "I’m not going to say, 'Do away with something that gives you the most confidence.' That’s like telling a guy not to wear a suit to an interview."  Turns out, people who like stripes actually have similar personality traits. According to Karen, people who love stripes are often good at multitasking, have a lot going on in their lives, and wear many hats. "They can get overwhelmed," she says, "but it’s also indicative of someone who works well under pressure." I felt like this assessment was spot-on.   In conclusion... I first spoke to Karen because I was curious if my love for stripes had a deeper meaning and wondered whether I should expand my horizons, style-wise—but I've realized wearing them is just another part of who I am. These alternating lines—no matter how big or small or what color they are—clearly make me happy, so why shouldn't I reserve real estate in my closet for them? And, although not everyone loves stripes as much as I do, if you're wondering whether you wear a certain trend or color too much, don't freak out. You just happen to have a signature style that makes your fashion even more noticeable.  Now, if you'll excuse me, all this stripe talk is making me want to look for more, and if you're with me, shop the items below.

Consider this one, which zips closed (important to note for anyone who has ever gone through security with a tote that doesn't have a closure and had everything spill out on the conveyor belt—just me?) and comes with a matching pouch that you can use as a makeup bag while traveling. If you love the look of those plastic see-through totes but are a bit more ~secretive~, consider this foggier blush style, which will just show the silhouettes of things inside without revealing exactly what's specifically in there. The perfect poolside bag, I didn't realize until right now, is one that's made out of a brightly colored, striped towel fabric. If you're not sure how adventurous you want to be with your everyday bag, consider at least branching out from the typical darker neutrals and trying a summery white bag. If you can't quit your leather shopper and just want a newer style in a more summery hue, this one's for you. Love animal print? Don't blame you. Check out this straw bag with a cleaver leopard-spot woven design! It may be the most fun beach bag ever. If you like neutral work bags but want to branch out just a little, consider this beige slouchy tote with a subtle snake-print design. A classic canvas tote is always appropriate, and this sporty pink style is the perfect size for your next day trip.

			 The swimsuit competition remains one of the most debated parts of the Miss USA pageant — at least until someone flubs an answer in the Q&A round. The swimsuit competition remains one of the most controversial parts of the pageant business — at least, that is, until someone flubs an answer in the Q&A round. To many, it's an archaic, ogle-centric spectacle reducing the contestants to their measurements, and sometimes a dodgy spray tan. But to many others (including the contestants themselves), it's an opportunity to showcase health and wellness, discipline, and a literal body of hard work.  Ahead of the 2018 Miss USA pageant, then, all 51 contestants bared their bikini bodies for the preliminary competition — click through to see them all onstage.

			 Maybe get two of everything?  PSA: As soon as you become an adult, people expect you not to come to parties empty-handed. Thankfully, you’ve landed on this article, which means you kinda know this, but you’re not sure what a good hostess gift would be. Typically, flowers, wine, or some kind of coffee/tea gift is a good start, but if you like to be a little more unique, trust—this list of ideas, below, has you covered! Scroll on.... One can never have enough cheese boards, and the proof is that you’re currently looking at this one, fully knowing you already own one but considering buying it for yourself. But this is not about you! Your hostess friend will love it too. :) While we’re here just talking about cheese, a set of modern-looking knives in this pretty, rich gold tone would be nice too, yes? Their next dinner party will look super cool with a centerpiece that includes these fun geometric candle holders. Anything poured out of this pitcher is going to look so much more elegant, and these are just the facts. Everyone could use pretty storage baskets to store things like pillows and throws in plain sight in an attractive way. Speaking of throws, if they need a new one, this cute tasseled blue-and-white striped one could be nice, eh? Their shelves will look so much cooler with this triangle-shaped marble and wood bookend. That’s just the truth. If they’re more of a green thumb, they’ll appreciate these hand-painted vases, perfect for the fresh flowers they love to keep around the house. If their binge-watch list includes any and all seasons of The Great British Baking Show, this set of pans for cakes, loaves, cookies, and muffins will be a huge hit. Oh, and if they love making pastries and such, they’ll definitely appreciate some kind of apron, which looks very pretty on its own but also will protect their other clothes from flour dust and frosting spillage. Clear glass goes with literally all decor ever, and they’ll use these babies for any organizing needs, from holding cookies to cotton balls. This insulated soft-sided cooler is chic enough for their next picnic or car ride and also spacious enough for crackers, wine, cheese, and anything else they wanna put in there! The standard hostess gift is a bottle of wine, but you can make things a little more festive with a rosé champagne. Every host wants their home to smell good—and since this gift is super low-maintenance (just set it in a room and forget about it until the liquid runs out), they’ll thank you even more. This vacuum-insulated wine chiller will keep their bubbles, whites, and rosés chilled to perfection during any events they host in the future. Help them keep track of their schedules with this floral appointment calendar for 2020. If they love cheese and cured meats, these little chalkboard signs that they can write on to distinguish one from another will be so appreciated. How pretty are these circular frames that can hold any keepsake or photo that’s worth displaying? A set of really nice hand soap and lotion is just the thing your host’s guest bathroom needs. If whiskey is your host’s vice, they’ll appreciate these stones, which look cool but also keep spirits cold without watering them down. Bathtime just got way more fun for them with this tray that includes an area for their book, iPad, or iPhone to stand up as well as specific spots for a wine glass and eating utensils. This box of tasty green teas will go over well with any pal on a health kick. And if they love tea, consider gifting them a brand-new insulated teapot! While we’re on the tea train, I’d like to make a case for these half-white, half-blue dipped teacups that look like the perfect drinking vessels. This glass decanter will make anyone’s bar cart look elegant. This set of three silicone trays creates cocktail-ready ice cubes. Got a tailgating pal? Give them a set of new stainless steel tools to work with. This one also comes with a variety of seasonings and a nice matching case. If their home bar isn’t very robust, go ahead and gift them this fun boxed set that looks great on any bar cart or cabinet and opens to reveal every single tool they’d need to make a mean drink. This cute thank-you box comes with a notebook, a fresh candle, and two coordinating ballpoint pens. Any wine drinker knows this is the best opener in the biz. It’s never a bad idea to show up to a party with a fresh bouquet of flowers, and this bunch of roses will make anyone smile.

			 50 percent off straw bags! Jumpsuits! Swimwear! Slides!  Anthropologie's "summer tag sale" is here, in which styles are up to 50 percent off, and you'll want to shop. ALL. OF. IT. Here, the 18 best picks from the sale, which has something for everyone, including home decor, jumpsuits, swimwear, and beachy bags to live your best summer life.  A breezy jumpsuit makes it so easy to choose your outfit for the day – just throw this one on, pair it with sandals and shades, and you're out the door.  Can't stop drinking coffee every day? Same. So why not use a colorful cup with your initial to brighten up each morning?  In case you haven't heard, straw bags are *the* it-bag this season, and this tote is not only fashionable, but roomy too.  Sure, high-waisted denim cut-offs are a summer staple, but if you're looking to switch it up, try a pair of patterned fabric ones instead to make a colorful statement.  Never lose a pair of earrings – or any other jewelry pieces – again with a citrusy trinket tray that will fit right in on your nightstand or dresser.  You'll definitely be summer ready in a yellow maxi dress that will feel blissful when it catches the breeze.  Snag a geometric pot to give your plants a cute new home.  A pair of tortoiseshell shades will shield your eyes from that bright summer sun, while the brown-tinted lenses and gold accents add a touch of cool.  You'll adore slipping a comfy, lacy white romper on before bed; just because you're sleeping doesn't mean you can't look cute doing it!  Tan leather shoes will go with basically any outfit in your closet whether you opt for a floral sundress, distressed jeans, or a ruffled romper.  Add more pillows to your bed or sofa with a set of pillow shams that look oh-so fancy without breaking the bank.  Update your current denim situation with a pair of wide-leg pants that have a belted tie-waist and embroidered details.  Love a fun statement shoe? Look no further than a pair of slip-ons with blue fringe and an espadrille block heel.  A sale gives you the perfect excuse to finally buy that French graphic tee you've been wanting for ages.  Knock 'em dead the next time you hit up the pool or beach with a checkered one-piece that has underwire cups.   If you have a serious obsession with candles, you can't beat one that's only $10. A striped, diamond-shaped one also doubles as a cute decoration for your room.  An ombré journal will keep your to-do lists and itineraries safe and secure, while the small size makes it easy to take on-the-go.  No other color is as popular in summer than white – it keeps you cool, after all – and a top with intricate cutouts works as both a stylish shirt and an anything-but-casual beach coverup.

			 Don't give up on layering just because it's hot outside! Summer's here, but if you love layering it can be hard to find outerwear that won't make you overheat. These 18 styles will keep you covered this season without breaking a sweat.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! A medium-wash denim jacket is the perfect piece of clothing to layer in the summer—the material isn't suffocating, and you won't get the chills when the A/C is blasting indoors.  Summer doesn't always mean it's sunny outside, so if the clouds are looking gray, opt for a multicolored design that still looks cute with cutoffs. Then when it inevitably gets hot later, you easily can fold it up and stuff it inside your bag.  This guy comes with a belt that you can tie around your waist or opt to leave open and loose; plus, the linen fabric of this still feels lightweight and breezy.  A marigold style channels the bright summer sun, and this one also has an adjustable drawstring at the waist so you can cinch it however tight—or loose—you want.  These jackets are useful thanks to all the pockets, but the pastel hue tones down the utilitarian look. Also, the cotton and linen fabric is a lifesaver in the heat.  A shorter style will look killer with all those high-waisted shorts you have and also won't feel like you're drowning in too much fabric. This army green one looks great with a crisp white tank and light-wash denim.  This is one of those pieces that works for any and all seasons depending on how you style it. Wear this open with a band tee, black shorts, and matching ankle boots for an edgier summer vibe.  This style's ideal if you're planning on hitting up the mall or movie theater—i.e,  any indoor place that is usually chilly in the summer months. The insulation of this will keep you warm in cool temps and cool in warm temps. Just simply roll up the sleeves when you're outside. A classic staple, this pattered blazer looks amazing with matching bottoms, or if you want to dress it down, pair it with distressed denim and sneakers. The oversize silhouette prevents the fabric from clinging to your skin too.   An unlined suede jacket makes a great summer layering piece, and a bright-yellow shade reflects the season.  This silhouette is so pretty you can even wear it on its own as a shirt. Cuff the sleeves a couple times and undo the top buttons to catch more of the breeze.  If you're tired of your typical blue jean jacket, opt for a bright white one. It looks just as cute with striped pants as it does with your fave floral dress, and because it's a neutral, you can wear it with practically any other hue.  A neutral-colored jacket goes with your whole summer wardrobe, and the adjustable drawcord hem and elastic cuffs give it a utilitarian feel.  A thinner crepe fabric, like what this longer design is made of, is ideal for layering in sweltering temps; plus, it'll add some color to any ensemble.  The silky fabric is more breathable than other stiffer materials and will feel like you're wearing nothing at all. This one has convenient front pockets and is perfect to dress up your outfit on a summer night.  White fabrics don't absorb as much sunlight as darker hues; plus, the broderie stitching in this one leaves tiny cutouts for a cooling effect.  Want to really show off your shirt underneath? Choose a see-through jacket that has a sporty vibe and pair it with white high-top sneakers.  A neutral jacket will go with anything in your summer wardrobe, while the dark stitching gives it a little somethin' extra. Wear it completely open with a bralette or crop top and you'll really stand out.

			 Yikes. On Sunday during London Fashion Week, designer Riccardo Tisci debuted a nautical-themed fall/winter 2019 runway show for Burberry in which a model wore a brown hoodie with ties at the neck that resembled a noose. It was an upsetting situation and one of the models who walked, Liz Kennedy, called it out as such. "Suicide is not fashion. It is not glamorous nor edgy...Riccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway... Let's not forget about the horrifying history of lynching either," she said in a post on Instagram. "How could anyone overlook this and think it would be okay to do this especially in a line dedicated to young girls and youth." She went on to explain why the garment was so disturbing to her personally. By Wednesday, Burberry's CEO, Marco Gobbetti, issued a response to the backlash: "We are deeply sorry for the distress caused by one of the products that featured in our A/W 2019 runway collection. Though the design was inspired by the marine theme that ran throughout the collection, it was insensitive and we made a mistake." Tisci has also apologized. "I am so deeply sorry for the distress that has been caused as a result of one of the pieces in my show on Sunday," he told Highsnobiety. "While the design was inspired by a nautical theme, I realize that it was insensitive. It was never my intention to upset anyone. It does not reflect my values nor Burberry's and we have removed it from the collection. I will make sure that this does not happen again." If you or someone you know needs help, please text Crisis Text Line at 741741, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 It looks just like the real deal.  The moment Jughead put on that black leather jacket on the Riverdale Season 1 finale, he basically sold his soul to the devil (well, to a pack of Serpents, technically).  His decision to temporarily take his dad's spot as a Southside Serpent ended up being a horrible idea, but you can't deny that jacket is badass. I've been searching the internet ever since to find one just like it and thanks to my emo fave Hot Topic, the hunt is finally over. They just restocked this fan favorite, a unisex faux leather jacket with a Southside Serpents patch that looks just like the real thing.  The best part? It's only $70.  Already have a leather jacket you want to Riverdale-up? Hot Topic also sells a Serpents patch you can stick on.  Or if you're more of a Cheryl type of chick, HT also has her smokin' hot Blossom-red Serpent jacket.  Want more Riverdale merch? Shop our favorites below.

			 Go braless for maximum impact. Look, I’m not one to invest in obviously trendy pieces. I have been a jeans and T-shirt kinda gal for as long as I can remember. As a very stylish friend once kindly observed, I “approach trends with the fear of a suburban grandmother.” And it’s true—I love wearing classic year-round staples and neutral palettes and putting in basically zero effort. (It’s called minimalism, ladies, look it up!)  In addition to being low effort, I’m also very thrifty. So imagine my joy when I found the perfect white tank top for an amazing bargain on Amazon. Before I order it in 10 other colors, here’s why you, too, need to add this $14 bb to your closet stat.   Why I Love It  I hugged a friend while wearing this shirt, which prompted her to scream, “OMG, what is this? It’s so soft.” And with v good reason—this thing is freakishly soft but also very structured. I’ve always loved the classic cut and versatility of those basic cotton tanks you can buy in multipacks, but I’ve never liked how sheer the fabric is—if I’m trying to get a lot of wear out of something, I don’t want to worry that I could easily poke a hole in it. This thick-ribbed tank, from Sugar Lips, is a nylon/spandex blend à la Spanx, meaning it is SUPER stretchy and feels thicker and softer than its counterparts.  It holds you in in all the right places but isn’t suffocating. On weekends, I’ve been tucking this gal into some high-waisted jeans or pairing it with a flowy summer skirt. But when it’s time to get down to business, it’s also sleek enough to wear underneath a structured blazer or an oversize cardigan or with your go-to work pants and heels.    When the color of your abs make your outfit match your bag 🤦🏻‍♀️ in @lioness_official blazer and jeans A post shared by  Danielle Bernstein (@weworewhat) on Jul 29, 2019 at 3:03pm PDT  Like any human with a cartoon character wardrobe, I love buying the same good thing in multiple colors! This one is so comfy that I’m considering really LEANING IN and getting it in neon green. It also comes in black, pink, blue, red, fuchsia, cream, and army green.  If you’ve been hesitant to Go There and really free-boob it, this supportive and otherwise modest tank top is an ideal training shirt, if you will. The straps are wide and flat enough to conceal your bra straps when you want to wear one, but the fabric is thick and supportive enough that if you DO choose to go braless, your boobs feel adequately swaddled and supported. If you’re on the bustier side and concerned with side-boob peeking out or showing off too much cleavage, trust that the neckline is juuust high enough and will smooth out any spillage on the sides.  What Could Be Better Sugar Lips says this is a “one size fits all” product, which initially made me groan. As anyone with a human woman body knows, “one size fits all” almost always translates to “one size fits actually very few of us.” But I will say that I cannot understate how stretchy this top is. It easily accommodates both my barely-B-cup boobs and my BFF’s DD bust. Still, a tight squeeze for the sake of catchall sizing is silly—would it really kill them to offer fully inclusive sizing that fits all bodies? Also, while the fabric smooths you out on top, it tends to roll up at the bottom. I hate this about most fitted shirts. But if you’re wearing this bad boy tucked into a pair of high-waisted shorts, a skirt, or pants, that should keep the roll-up from getting in your way. The Verdict If you’ve been on the lookout for a classic-fit tank with a lil more support, this crazy-soft and durable tank top is your new BFF. It smooths you out, holds everything in, easily conceals bra straps, and comes in a ton of cute colors. Cons: While it is truly VERY stretchy, the “one size fits all” sizing is limiting, and the bottom tends to roll up. Still, at $14 a pop on Amazon, the price of approximately one (1) fancy cocktail, the pros outweigh the cons.   BUY NOW Seamless Ribbed Tank Top, SUGAR LIPS, $14

			 Turns out, there IS a difference between a demi and a balconette.  Okay, there are a LOT of bra types out there. But what’s the difference between a demi and a balconette, you ask? Or a padded bra versus a push-up? Well, you’ve come to the right place.  Now you’ll never have to guess which style is right for you—and you can shop for pretty bras along the way. Here, 23 comfy, sexy, and supportive ones that address specific issues you’re looking to solve.  These bras are typically seamless with round, molded cups, so—true to their name—they (usually) don’t show under a tight-fitting T-shirt. This top-rated Natori style offers great support with slimmer lace straps and less coverage at the top for a more revealing style. The underwire cup has a naturally rounded, smooth shape that vanishes under your clothing. No underwire? No problem. Bralettes are typically free of wires and molded cups and are often decorative and made of lace or other delicate fabrics. This unlined stretch bralette is so pretty it should be seen! The sweetness of the scalloped trim will look so cute peeking out of a floral dress. Strapless bras are a must for any shoulder-baring outfit if you don’t want visible straps. Many have silicone lining that sticks to skin and prevents slipping. This popular Calvin Klein one has a sweetheart neckline and boning so it keeps its shape. Balconettes and demi bras are VERY similar, but they’re not the same. This style is a little more revealing than a full-coverage style because the cups are cut smaller and show more of the top half of the breast. This gorge lacy one from ThirdLove is a fan fave and available in cup sizes A to I. Now, this silhouette is cut even lower than a balconette and works better under low-cut scoop-neck tops. This particular style has a scalloped trim and is lightly lined for gentle shaping. You can also wear it as a racerback for extra versatility. Don’t like your boobs going all over the place? Wire cups provide support and keep them in place. But just because they’re functional doesn’t mean they don’t look cute. Case in point: this delicate floral mesh bra. If you can’t stand bumps from your bra showing from under your outfit, then you definitely want to get this one. The material is usually thin and has ample stretch so it lies flat on skin and smoothes any lines. This popular True & Co. one is available in sizes XS to 2XL. Hide straps when you wear a racerback top with this bra, thanks to the straps that cross in the back. Tons of these are also convertible racerbacks, meaning you can wear the straps both ways since they hook and unhook. This style has a sexy lace back and an easy-to-use front closure. These are popular for those with larger breasts since they usually reduce the size of your bustline up to an inch. You can wear ’em to make your tops fit better and not feel as tight against your chest if you’re uncomfortable. The full cups cover the entire breast, so if you’re into cleavage, this probably isn’t the style for you. This one does the job if you like extra coverage and support, and the lace and bow details are super cute. Wear a lotta V-necks and low-cut shirts? Get yourself this silhouette. Depending on the bra, some plunges go deeper than others—even extending past the band for a lil extra dip. They come in a range of styles, but for the most part, these guys are all about providing support whether your workout is low- or high-impact. They will wick away any sweat and are made with breathable material so you don’t overheat. This style offers tons of stretch, a compression fit for minimal bounce, and a strappy back design. It has clips on the straps to unfasten each cup and make the whole nursing process so much more seamless. This pink one also has removable, molded foam cups and comes in five other shades, and it’s machine washable. The padding on these can range from light to heavy depending on how much of a lift you’re looking for. This style in particular adds a whole cup size; however, there are other bras out there that are more subtle or have removable padding. You can probs guess it from the name, but essentially, this style is like a super-cropped tank top with a scoop neckline and wider straps. It’s a go-to for lounging and it also looks great with high-waisted bottoms if you want a more low-key, sporty look. This one is made with Supima cotton for a supersoft feel and also comes in five other shades. Longline silhouettes have fabric that extends beyond the underwire toward the ribcage. This soft yellow style has padded foam cups that provide definition and has a large size range, from 28D to 38G. These bras can do it ALL. You can typically wear them strapless or as a racerback, a halter-neck, a one-shoulder, and more. This four-in-one multiway bra goes up to a 42F with silicone along the top and band to keep the girls in place. Arguably one of the most popular shapes when it comes to bras is the triangle, and it means exactly what the name says: It has triangular-shaped cups that attach to the band, like this baby-blue style. Bandeaus have a neckline that goes straight across, so you can wear them for cleavage coverage or as a bra top. Many feature lace, but you can also find simpler ones if that’s what you’re into. This particular one has light padding and is great for smaller cup sizes. There’s less fabric on the cups with this silhouette, so it’s usually more sheer and lightweight. A delicate lace underwire bra with a sweet ribbon bow is perfect for your more casual days, and it looks so cute peeking out from a white tee. No matter your age or size, many of us experience underarm bulge, but if you want to prevent it, get a smoothing bra like this one. It has extra side-coverage panels that create a seamless (i.e., bulge-free) silhouette that won’t show under your sleeveless tops and dresses. For extra lift and to make your cup size appear larger, a push-up is the way to go. They’re most often underwire bras that have foam or gel padding for extra emphasis. One that’s lilac with lace overlay on the straps definitely makes a statement. If you have a closet filled with backless dresses and no bra to wear with them, this self-adhesive strapless bra is your answer. The style sticks to your skin for a barely-there feel and works for most tricky dresses and tops. Some are washable and reusable (up to a certain amount of wears), like this beige one here.

This is also a Reese Witherspoon book club pick, FYI, so you know it's great.  She loves sweets (and she prob loves rosé), so these cute bear-shaped gummies are the best of both worlds.  A chic metallic clutch with pretty tassel details will add pizzazz to any Mother's Day look. She won't know which flavor to pick first with an herbal tea sampler that offers 14 various infusions.   A pair of delicate sparkly studs will complement any of her outfits. These babies are also available in rose gold and silver if you want more options.   Her ideal getting-ready routine starts with a cup of coffee and the newspaper, so get her a gold-accented mug with adorable tiny hearts.  She can hydrate on the go—and be green while doing it—thanks to a modern-looking reusable glass bottle.  She loves preserving memories and photos in a scrapbook, so this kit, with its cute font and fun colors and bold stickers, will get a lot of use.

			 The Fug Girls recap who rocked the red carpet.   Newly-minted Emmy winner Tiffany—she nabbed one last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys, for hosting Saturday Night Live—didn’t have the will-she-or-won’t-she pressure on her tonight, so she could let loose and celebrate. This dress is the most delightful way we can imagine for her to do it. She’s a human rainbow, and hopefully her pot of gold is waiting for her somewhere. In half the red carpet photos, Tracee was trying to wrangle that enormous ruffle. Rolling around in Barbie’s guest bedding for the night doesn’t seem ENTIRELY worth it if you can’t get the crudite to your mouth quickly. Her heels are a normal, non-foot-snapping height! The dress pattern reminds us of the Frances books we read when we were little—and that’s a compliment! Can it be that someone finally looked at Millie Bobby Brown’s IMDb page and realized she’s still only 14? It’s a miracle, and not a moment too soon. Bless her for showing up to present—and saying the word “Empire” several times to Giuliana—in something this dramatically bright and bold. Leslie looks totally dynamic in this suit. Gone are the days when she had to go hunting for a designer who’ll dress her; why on earth would you not? When she was shooting The Kissing Booth, there's no way Joey King could not have imagined being the toast of social media and at the Emmys in a gown that could give Taraji’s a run for the most dramatic of the night. We haven’t wanted to wear raspberry so badly since Prince sang about the beret. Allison is at her National Treasure finest in this. If we had a peerage system, we would demand a title for Allison Janney. She is so funny and dishy and smart, looks completely perfect in this goddess-like sheath, and no doubt can tell a raunchy story or three over a liquid lunch. That’s our kind of dame, or Dame, for sure. Let's just be honest: This is glorious. It is a Gown with a capital G, a proper noun of a dress. Angela was one of the first people to hit the red carpet, and with good reason: This look deserved all the screen time it could get.       In fairness, maybe this isn't technically a Dress Over Pants, as much as it is a Jumpsuit With a Train. Whatever it is, it's delicate and pretty and dreamy on her—as long as you don't start thinking about how the pants might be a little too long.  Jessica Biel is beautiful and has popped up at many awards shows over the years, and she's looked very pretty at many of them. But "immaculately crisp and architecturally interesting" are not words we've ever used on her before, making this one of her very best efforts. And that's not even getting into her moral victory of being able to speak at length to Giuliana on the pre-show without Justin Timberlake interrupting. She lost her category but she's still a winner for that alone.  We haven't had as many red carpet moments from Packham in recent years, and her London Fashion Week presentation was painfully small for those of us who love her aesthetic. Enter Samira Wiley, who gave us our fix in this bit of silver perfection. She took home Best Guest Actress in a Drama for her role in The Handmaid's Tale at the Creative Arts Emmys last week, and we applaud her for picking something as gleaming as the hardware she has for her mantel. This is divine.  Keri Russell is divinely talented and tremendously chic, and we are sad she came to the Emmys in support of The Americans in a dress that seems to have molted in the limo on the way over. Is there any better way to celebrate being in a groundbreaking smash-hit summer movie than being one of the best dressed at the Emmys? Well, possibly; we'd take ourselves on an exceptional vacation, and go on a shopping spree at Harry Winston. But this certainly isn't the worst way to go. We only want excellence for Chrissy, and unfortunately, this does not qualify—although it does have an '80s nighttime soap realness to it that we need to salute in theory, if not in practice. This number went down the runway mere days ago at New York Fashion Week, and Zasie and her stylist were deeply correct to call dibs. She looks luxurious, lush, and all around amazing. (Bonus points for the major earrings, too.)  You could argue that her scarf is a bridge too far—there are some shots of this dress where it looks like a ginormous sleeve—but we're too tickled by the color to raise any objections. Jenifer, a hoot on Black-ish, is anything but goofing off with this ensemble. She wore Nike specifically to honor the brand for supporting Colin Kaepernick, the teamless NFL quarterback who kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black people—a topic her show set out to cover until ABC scrapped the episode. “Thank you, Colin. Thank you for all that you do. Thank you for being brave. Thank you for being courageous. Thank you for taking a knee,” she said, later adding, “We need more corporate America to stand up also.” Well played. Visit the Fug Girls on their website, or follow them on Twitter.

			 She wore a jacket... and nothing else. Well, also shoes. Here's what we know: Kourtney Kardashian went to the Polo Bar restaurant in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night. She ~stepped out~ wearing a Helmut Lang jacket with sexy side cutouts, a lacy bra, slouchy knee-high boots, and no pants. For inquiring minds, this is the exact piece she wore. It used to cost $655, but right now, it's on sale at Net-a-Porter, so that's something! Oftentimes, blazers come as a package-deal with a pair of matching pants. For Kourtney, the pants part was whatever, and I get it, because yesterday was pretty hot in NYC, and sometimes you just wanna show some leg. Also, this jacket is totally long enough to be a mini dress. So there! If you're interested in having a Kourtney moment, shop the blazer dresses below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Making us look cool since basically the dawn of time. The sun is glaring, reflecting off skyscraper windows in New York City, so you reach into your bag and grab your favorite pair of shades. Maybe they're classic aviators or wayfarers, or huge, face-shielding frames that cover your eyebrows and most of your cheeks; perhaps they're the popular Kardashian-Jenner approved slim styles that barely block your eyes.  No matter what the size, color, or shape, each pair has one thing in common: Sunnies always have been linked with a sense of rebellion, mystery, and edginess. Sunglasses historian Dr. Vanessa Brown, professor of culture, style, and fashion at the School of Art and Design at Nottingham-Trent University and author of Cool Shades: The History and Meaning of Sunglasses, explains why. 
  It's widely believed on the Internet that the first pair of "sunglasses" date back to native Inuit cultures, who created goggles out of whale bone with slits to fight the sun glare coming off the snow. Experts like Brown credit styles designed for industrial work like welding, which came into being in the late 1910s, as part of the inspiration behind our modern idea of the accessory.  When sunbathing became a popular pastime in the 1920s, Foster Grant sold dime-store tinted glasses at the beach to prevent squinting, but Brown says the frames were used more for practical, sun-blocking purposes — they weren't a fashion statement. "At the time," she says, "sunglasses were something you'd tidy away if someone was going to take a great photo of you." Dark glasses, she adds, also were used by the blind or men who sustained eye injuries in World War I.  
  In the early '30s, the closest thing to fashion shades was driving goggles, which women wore cruising around in cars that didn't yet have windows. "There was excitement and rebellion in women driving and having to wear these goggles," Brown says, because not everyone believed women could or should drive. Wearing the goggles was a way to showcase unabashed independence. One of the first fashion brands to embrace sunglasses as a "trend" in a photo shoot was Harper's Bazaar in 1938. "In the photo, a model sits at a table writing a postcard," Brown says, adding that she wore a kind of early wayfarer style. The image comes off as cool, almost aloof, for the onlooker, because you can't see the subject's eyes. Around this time, Bosch & Lomb invented the classic aviator frame — first as a way for pilots to protect their eyes, later as a fashion accessory. Being seen in the same light as a World War I pilot — glamorized for daring, risk-taking behavior — was considered cool, according to Brown. "Fighter pilots were famous for disobeying orders, because, often, they thought they knew better than their superiors," Brown says. Those styles influenced fashion through the '40s and beyond. 
  In the late '40s and early '50s, Brown says, many women began cutting their hair short, railing against traditional concepts of beauty. The manufacturers who previously made plastic combs to pin back long strands had to figure out another way to earn money, so they turned to sunglasses. Enter: funky frames, like cat-eyes with delicate floral appliqués.  Then, in 1956, Ray-Ban made the first wayfarer, and the style instantly became iconic, thanks in part to jazz performers like Charlie Parker. "The musicians would wear them onstage in clubs at night, which definitely added to their mystique," says Brown.  There were a few reasons why the accessories were important to the musicians. Wearing them, they wouldn't have to make eye contact with "square" club owners and patrons who didn't understand their music.  "And some would say they'd do anything to put something between them and the audience," Brown adds, "so they didn't make requests for them to play something rubbish."  Beyond that, she says, "just the sheer idea of wearing sunglasses at night — they wanted to draw attention to themselves." Elsewhere, femme fatales in film noirs wore dark wayfarers, Brown says, which emphasized their mysterious characters.  
  As the '60s came around, sunglasses ran the gamut in size and shape. While classic aviators and wayfarers still were in fashion, small, round frames favored by John Lennon became popular, as did the big, bug-eyed Francois Pinton styles Jackie O. made famous.  At the same time, Brown says, designer Paco Rabanne debuted spacey, alien-like frames that at once declared the wearer to be a fan of progress and the space race. It was a statement that said, "Hey, look at how different I am. I really stand out." 
  Brown says the dominant Jackie O. trend, worn by women on the cutting-edge of cool, spurred frame sizes to grow even larger in the '70s. Pioneered by designers like Christian Dior, the styles were glossy with ombre, pastel-colored lenses — almost makeup-like, tinting the area around your eye. The tendency toward clearer, brighter lenses, as opposed to dark ones, emphasized the idea of being natural, according to Brown, despite holding so much real estate on the face. This look and feel was in line with the hippie movement which, simultaneously, was reaching critical mass.  On the other end of the spectrum, glam-rock artists like David Bowie and Elton John made more expressive styles, like the ones by designers Paloma Picasso and Cazcal, which harkened back to the '50s, popular again. Fans of these felt their shades made a counter-culture statement about not following the masses. Brown says the '80s took that glam-rock look and raised the bar with angular and asymmetric designs, like the ones Alain Mikli debuted in the 1987 film Overboard. The palette was full of primary colors: bright red, white, yellow, and blue. Once again, the styles were viewed as a way to catch people's eyes and stand out from a crowd. The wayfarer remained trendy — especially after Tom Cruise's Risky Business premiered in 1983, and Americans wanted to emulate the young actor. With new technology, like computers and the Internet, in the '90s, alien-like frames took on even more dominance. Remember Oakley's? This was their major moment, and it continued well into the early 2000s, according to Brown. Simultaneously, slender frames rose in popularity. Brown attributes the nostalgic style wave to a negative response to those new technologies: Forgoing new-age plastic materials and going back to tiny, metallic wire frames was a way to go against the grain of progress. 
  Nowadays, says Brown, it's all about riffing off what's come before. For that reason no one shape or color has dominance, even if it does seem like those narrow, rectangular shades are everywhere.  "If you're wearing an oversize, crazy heart shape with glitter — you're presenting yourself as someone who is fun and whimsical," says Erica Russo, accessories fashion director for Bloomingdale's. "If you love staying on the trends, and you want to embrace streetwear and be totally different than the crowd, you'd wear a slim sun style. If you're running out for coffee, and you just want something simple and classic, grab your black wayfarers.  "You can do all of those things in the same week if you want to, and no one would say a word."

			 Prince Nikolai of Denmark just landed his first contract.  It seems to be one of the great injustices of our time that children who are blessed by being born into royalty can also be so devastatingly good looking that they can model. Prince Nikolai of Denmark is one such person. The 18-year-old son of Prince Joachim and Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, just signed his first modeling contract with Scoop Models, the company announced with a series of headshots on Instagram yesterday.  Make sure you scroll through all these pics because you will not be disappointed. I mean, come on. That hair! That jawline! That dewy skin that looks like it's ripped straight from a Glossier ad! Ugh.  Nikolai, who is sixth in line for the throne, made his modeling debut during London Fashion Week. He walked in the Burberry show, and Scoop confirmed to Danish newspaper Billedbladet that he is in fact signed with the agency and they were the ones who booked him for Burberry. Cara Delevingnealso walked in the show.  This isn't the first time a member of a royal family has taken a detour into fashion. Earlier this week, the late Prince Diana's niece, Lady Kitty Spencer, walked Dolce and Gabbana's "Secrets & Diamonds" show. But apparently Nikolai is the type to like doing his own thing. His father told Billedbladet that Nikolai "should not be forced into something. Nikolai’s future shall be conducted entirely by his own plan." Hopefully that includes *lots* more modeling.

They sit on the cochlear bone instead of being wedged inside the ears, so she can hear what’s going on around her (i.e., if the baby’s crying) and still listen to her favorite tunes or podcasts. This kit comes with a moisturizer, facial oil, a glowy mask, and hydrating face mist, so she (or at least her skin) will feel majorly rejuvenated.  These Birkenstocks are completely waterproof, so she's ready for anything that is thrown, tossed, or spilled in her direction.  This map is based on the exact date and time a baby is born and adds a decorative touch to any nursery.  Sometimes a long night turns into an even longer morning—a comfy robe is the ultimate loungewear piece for any time of day.

This blanket is an adorable way to announce each month's milestone. So swaddle that baby and snap a quick photo!  A silk pillowcase is more gentle on skin and hair, reducing the amount of split ends and breakouts she’ll get overnight. This diffuser and humidifier will fill her space with any fragrance she chooses. Pro tip: Eucalyptus oil will make her feel calm and collected on a hectic day.  This portable printer is super thin and prints on sticker paper, so she's free to place any pic wherever she wants. Fill this box with hospital bracelets, sentimental pictures, or even baby announcements. It's an accent piece that is as useful as it is beautiful. Clean Beauty’s perfumes are perfect for layering to create a unique fragrance just for her.  String lights that also hold images make for cute (and easy!) wall art.  A satin bow onesie will guarantee a swoon for any occasion. I mean, the dish towel’s not lying. No matter where she is this Mother's Day, Homesick has a candle for every state, each with a different scent, so she's reminded of her roots.  Sometimes a handwritten card means more than any other gift.

			 I wouldn't change this moment for the world. Walking out of the Minneapolis airport terminal dragging a carry-on and a heavy tote on an early Friday morning in August 2017, I felt exhausted — but I didn't care: I was excited to be home from NYC to go wedding-dress shopping with my mom, my sister, and a few of my closest friends. As I approached the arrivals curb, I saw my mom and dad sitting in the car, eager to welcome me back — and although I was pumped to see them, a question immediately came to mind, since I was heading straight to dress appointments: Why is my dad here? "So, Dad, are you going to drop mom and I off at the showroom, or…?" I tentatively asked after exchanging the appropriate hellos and hugs. 
  "No, I'm coming along!" he replied. I tried to think of a way to let him down easy. I could see he was giddy about joining, but I always had assumed that most fathers see their child's wedding gowns for the first time on the big day, not a moment before. Plus, my father isn't exactly known for his fashion advice (sorry, dad). "Are you sure you want to come?" I asked. "I want to see you pick the dress when everyone else does," he responded. Who was I to deny him that moment when my mom and sister would be able to see it? Also, I still didn't have a good reason, other than I assumed it just wasn't really done. Later, I would wonder where that assumption ever came from. So we all went into the store together — my dad, my mom, a few of my bridesmaids, and myself. The attendant looked at our crew and asked who was helping me pick out my dress; I introduced everyone before shyly adding, "and my dad" — who was beaming. She set up everyone on a plush couch outside a large, sunlit fitting-room area with a slate-gray curtain.  We started talking about which dress styles we liked or thought would look good on me. My mom had ideas (let's just say she envisioned something very princess-y), while I had other thoughts (something slinky — and definitely not a voluminous skirt). My dad, for his part, stayed mostly silent at first. The first dress I tried was more "me": a fitted, backless design with a plunging neckline, with not much in the way of sparkle or lace, just a simple ruching detail in the middle of the bodice. My mom's silence spoke volumes, while my friends felt the look was sleek and modern. My dad liked what he called the "gathered part" at the center but felt, overall, that the gown was too plain.  I knew then he wasn't going to be shy about chiming in. Sure, he didn't really know the lingo ("What's illusion mesh, Rachel?"), but he had fun discussing the various styles with my bridesmaids and my mom, and it was charming to witness all the back-and-forth banter. It hit me: I really appreciated having my dad there. The next dress was a more flowery design full of lacy appliqués. It was a mermaid silhouette, and I didn't feel like it was that flattering on me. Everyone generally agreed it wasn't The One, but we tried it on with a matching cathedral-length veil, and my dad was OBSESSED ("It adds so much drama!"). After that, we added veils left and right. My dad was good at remembering the previous looks I had tried on and comparing the styles with each other for context. An hour — and four more dresses — later, I slipped into my sixth and last gown. I was feeling frustrated, having not found something my mom and I could necessarily agree on. My bridesmaids were tired but hanging in there, and my dad was still smiling. His mood was infectious, and it truly helped us all keep going.  I looked in the mirror in my fitting room before facing everyone — again — in the final design. The gown was stunning. What was more, it was a great middle ground between what I wanted in a dress and what my mom did, but it didn't feel like a compromise. I began to smile a little bit, although I was still nervous about what everyone would say. The attendant opened the curtain, and right away, I could tell this look was different from all the others. My bridesmaids' mouths were in perfect ovals, and their eyes got very wide — they almost collectively squealed with glee on cue. My mom started tearing up a bit, which made my own eyes well up. Then I looked over to my dad. He was absolutely elated. "It's perfect," he said. He got up, walked all around me, and talked about every inch of it. He told me to walk around the salon so we could see it from every angle. Then, he got closer, inspecting the detail of the sparkly appliqués. "This artistry is absolutely awesome," he said. "Look at this!" He motioned my mom over to see. Of course, when the attendant told us there was a matching cathedral-length veil, he was all over that too. "That veil with the dress — and the little floral details and the sparkles! It's celestial! It has so much dimension!" he said. There was some back and forth about the price — could we afford it? — but he wouldn't allow us to think about it for another minute, and neither would my mom. "We're getting it right now. This is The One," they said. My parents and I hugged, and everyone cried. As we all reveled in the fact that I had just found my dress, my dad asked questions about which designer it was and began Googling her on his phone. He'd go on to talk about her and her amazing work for the rest of the weekend whenever he had the chance. It was clear that being included in this event made my dad ecstatic — and looking back, I can't believe there ever was a time I thought about excluding him. Bringing him also gave me a totally different perspective on picking out a wedding dress. Wedding traditions — either around the dress or the events of the day — can be wonderful, but sometimes breaking them can be even more valuable. Sure, this moment between my dad, my mom, my bridesmaids, and me wasn't caught by a professional photographer, but a photo couldn't possibly capture the range of emotions on both of our faces throughout the whole time, everything he said, or how all my bridesmaids — and even the salon attendant — reacted to his enthusiasm (tears all around). I've always heard that everything goes by so quickly on your wedding day, it's basically all a blur. I feel lucky that I remember this moment so clearly, because it was the only thing that everyone was focused on that day.   Afterward, my dad and the rest of us celebrated with a round of Champagne at a nearby outdoor bar. He kept telling everyone how honored he was to be included and how much fun it was to be there with all of us. We all had the same response: "We couldn't have done it without you."

			 But what does it mean?! It's safe to say Meghan Markle's style has always been on point (I mean, how does she always look so effortless and put together?!), but now that she's married into the royal family, there definitely is more of a spotlight on her fashion choices. And ever since Markle and Prince Harry announced their engagement in November, it seems that she is particularly fond of one color: green.  Twitter user @MeghansMirror pointed out in April that Markle has worn the color multiple times—often pairing it with neutrals—when representing the Royal Family on official business. Interesting that other than the basics (white, grey, navy, black), the only colour #MeghanMarkle has worn clothing-wise as a representative of the Royal Family is green. pic.twitter.com/ss2ae4PAxd Here's an investigation into all the times she's worn green on official royal duty and what it possibly could mean.     Let's start at the most recent green sighting: Markle arrived at the Dublin Airport during a royal visit to Ireland wearing an emerald short-sleeve sweater and matching pencil skirt by Givenchy—the same brand that designed her stunning wedding dress. She paired the ensemble with neutral suede pumps and a chic Strathberry tote bag, which is still available BTW! While her and Prince Harry have ventured to Ireland before (See Exhibit E), this visit marked marked their first royal tour together as a married couple, and they really made a chic entrance to the country.  Just one day earlier, she debuted this stunning olive-colored, belted Ralph Lauren dress, complete with a hat by Stephen Jones, at Prince Louis' christening. She accessorized with a pair of matching suede heels, a clutch, and pantyhose for the formal occasion that took place at St. James Palace in London.  One of the most gorgeous  green looks Markle wore was on April 21, when she was photographed in a pleated floral Self-Portrait dress with a black Alexander McQueen blazer, Manolo Blahnik pumps, and a Roland Mouret shoulder bag. She wore the look while attending the Invictus Games reception in London with Harry. Next, Markle attended the U.K. Team Trials for the Invictus Games at the University of Bath in April wearing a khaki-green Aritzia trench coat over black jeans and a shirt, which is shockingly still available. Then, in March, she was photographed in Ireland in—yep, you guessed it—a dark green skirt with a flounced hem by Greta Constantine. She paired it mostly with neutrals, including a cream Victoria Beckham sweater, a grey Mackage overcoat, and a brown top-handle bag by Charlotte Elizabeth.   Just one month later, Markle wore the color yet again. This time, she opted for a tartan blue-and-green Burberry wool coat and paired it with a crossbody Strathberry bag during a visit to Edinburgh, Scotland, with her then fiancé.  She even matched the pattern and color scheme of her coat to this adorable mini horse and this man's kilt. Talk about coordination! Fast-forward to January 2018, when Markle was spotted with a forest-green DeMellier London top-handle bag (which, surprisingly, is also still available) during her first official visit to Wales. The bag really stood out against her all-black ensemble, and it marked the second time she (publicly) wore the same shade of green.  
  In November 2017, Markle wore a green dress by the label P.A.R.O.S.H. (albeit underneath a white belted coat by Canadian brand Line the Label) during the couple's engagement photo call, accessorizing the look with a pair of Aquazzura heels.  After the shoot, she and Harry sat down for their first joint interview, in which you can see the dress more clearly. Although not ALL of her recent outfits feature the color green (take this bright yellow look, for instance), she's definitely worn it enough times that it's probably intentional. According to royal expert Rob Shuter, wearing green is a strategic move. "Second to blue, green is the most popular shade for women in Britain," he said in an interview with Yahoo!. It's also the color of the British suffrage movement, so the hue makes sense given that Markle is an advocate of women's rights.  
  Kate Middleton made waves in a  green dress at February's BAFTA awards, where most attendees opted to wear black in support of the #TimesUp movement. This might have been Middleton's subtle way of showing support for women at the event, and it seems like Markle might be taking up the cause by featuring the color in her wardrobe as of late. Honestly, I can't wait for her to continue the green trend, because the color complements her like none other.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Because she deserves the best! Few people know your sister as well as you do, but that doesn’t mean you always know the perfect gift to get her. Similar to picking out gifts for your mom or your brother, finding something original that you haven’t gotten for your sister yet after all these years is near impossible. Your sis is always there for you (even when you just want her to leave you alone, TBH), so obviously, you need to score her the perfect present—no pressure! Lucky for you, we’ve rounded up 40 amazing gifts for sisters, so scroll ahead and impress her with these finds. Since she’s always stealing your clothes, get your sister a sweater dress of her own. This one is cozy yet chic, which means she can wear it whether she’s going out or just lounging around. If you’re like a second mom to your sister, you probs nag her about the amount of time she spends on her phone or laptop. Get her these inexpensive yet stylish blue-light glasses so at least she can protect her eyes during all that screen time. Does she love gold accessories? Get her this super-cool lariat necklace that you’ll definitely be stealing from her later. With all the broken zippers, spilled foundations, and crumbs of miscellaneous powder, it’s no shock that makeup bags don’t last very long. This travel case, on the other hand, has a double zipper, padded organizational inserts, and a hard shell to protect all the products your sister throws inside. The only thing worse than cold feet is sweaty feet. These slipper sandals are the perfect compromise. Thanks to the open toe and fuzzy faux fur, your sister’s feet will stay warm but not too warm. Get her this trio set of shimmer body oil, duo highlighter, and lip balm with 24K gold flecks so she can feel like the queen that she is. If your sister spends most of her time on her phone and the other half dropping it, she’ll need a few phone cases for protection. This one is not only shock-proof, but it also has colorful lil cheetahs on it! Your sis might have a lot of hoop earrings already, but she’ll love to add these unique illusion hoops into her rotation. Whether your sister has straight, wavy, or curly hair, this conditioning trio will give her ends some much-needed TLC. Complete with a shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave-in mask, her damaged strands will be a thing of the past. A denim and faux-shearling coat with a quilted lining is the perfect transitional piece for days when she needs something a little bit warmer. Jewelry is like art, and it deserves to be on display. This cool glass box will keep your sister’s earrings, necklaces, and bracelets organized without hiding them away. Send your sister a passive-aggressive message with a cute pink candle and funny label. The floral and teak scent will make your sister feel so chill, she’ll forgive you for the sassy saying. Instead of dropping all your money on one perfume, get your sister a set of five luxe fragrances for a fraction of the cost. This set has everything from floral to spicy to woodsy scents, so she’ll def find one she can’t go without. What are little sisters for if not breaking into your room and reading your diary? Get your sis her own journal so maybe she’ll stop reading yours. If she loves to snuggle up in something soft, gift your sister this loose, cropped sweater that she’ll wear all fall and winter long. And let’s be honest, probably spring too. If your sis has gotten deeeeep into the scrunchie trend, she’ll one hundred percent appreciate this set. Covered in silk and skinnier than your average scrunchie, these are the perfect solution for when she wants something smaller but still gentle on her strands. Does your sister love to travel? Then she’ll love this weekender bag that’s not only cute but also super practical—it even has a hidden compartment along the bottom for storing shoes separately. The black or checkered Vans are cool and classic, yes, but this pair of off-white sneakers will go with pretty much anything. In other words, your sister will get good use out of this pair and you won’t feel like you wasted your money. Add an easy touch of hygge to her home with a shaggy pillow that she can throw on her couch or her bed. Fact: No matter how “clean” they are, you probs don’t want to use the shared yoga mats at your gym. Get your sis her very own that has a unique print, like this marbled one. If your sister is in college and lives at the dorms, she’d appreciate a pretty diffuser like this one so she can fill her room with the scent of a relaxing essential-oil candle without the fire hazard. She’ll love this pair of delicate bow-detailed slides with a stabilizing block heel. Any trendy sister will be thankful for this fleece teddy bomber in a pretty dusty-rose color. It’s the perfect transition jacket from summer to fall. She’ll definitely appreciate this set of gold stackable rings that will go with literally any of her outfits. Any frequent gym-goer will love a pair of pretty dusty-rose leggings (with pockets!) that they can wear to run, lift weights, and generally bust a move. Of course you can always see her shine, but with a shimmery gel highlighter, everyone else will be blinded by it too. She’ll say “Yes way, frosé!” to a boozy popsicle version of the girls’ night in. A cat-eye shape suits everyone, and a bright-pink option will make her stand out from the crowd. Rupi Kaur’s honest and empowering collection of poems is a must-read for the young women of today. Her jewelry game will be so strong with a pair of stylish asymmetrical initial earrings. Save her a year’s worth of trips to the dermatologist with an at-home microdermabrasion tool. Get her this classic tortoise acetate and silk-satin tote from Montunas if she’s stylish. It comes with a removable drawstring silk-satin pouch to securely stow her cell phone, card holder, and lipstick. Gorgeous wine-colored agate coasters are a gift she will adore—and most likely would never buy for herself. Your sister will love the versatility of a midi slip dress that’s great for layering or stunning on its own—especially in this gorge shade of marigold. These cute sheet masks target every kind of skincare issue from dryness to dullness, and the pack of 10 makes them ideal for a spa night with the gals. Let her marble obsession follow her around the world with a multicolored carry-on. You can’t go wrong with the classic gift of super-soft and beautiful pajamas. Adorable and SO useful, these mini rubber critters keep her charging cables from falling apart. Glamour on the go gets easier with a silk pillowcase and eye mask travel set. A light-up makeup mirror that’s sleek and portable? Yes, please. She’ll use it every day and feel like a glam Hollywood actress.

			 Bring! Back! The! Pink! Leggings! The glow-up is real! Kendall Jenner has gone from standing in Kim's shadow on Keeping Up with the Kardashians to being a bonafide supermodel ready to steal every spotlight she enters. And she's changed a lot in the process. Behold Kendall's stunning transformation ahead, from her style choices to her hair and makeup. Kendall shows up with her sister Kylie Jenner to a Wango Tango concert, pairing casual neon pink leggings with Converse sneakers. Honestly, it's a perfect outfit for a kid on the red carpet.  Side note: Shout out to Kylie's Uggs. One year later, Kendall hits the ESPYs, looking slightly more grown up in heels and a ruffled mini-dress. Her minimal makeup look already screams "model off-duty." Kendall is back at Wango Tango two years later — still keeping it casual with a denim skirt and sneakers. That said, her blazer definitely has an "Oh hi, I'm older and more sophisticated now, FYI!" vibe. She also keeps it casual that same month, wearing jeans and a striped sleeveless shirt. Flash-forward a few months, and Kendall attends the premiere of Easy A, getting fully decked out in a flirty black-and-white dress with a sweetheart neckline. She hasn't made the transition to couture quite yet, but just you wait. Kendall's style begins to take on a more grown-up aesthetic: She's ditched the patterns, wears all black like a true NYC model, and rocks a sleek, slicked-back ponytail.  Kendall and Kylie both opt for frills — Kendall in a neutral hue, Kylie in white — for the premiere of Never Say Never.  Honestly, the only clue that this isn't Kendall circa right now is the platform on her stilettos. Otherwise, the shift dress and hair tendrils are 100 percent a look she'd rock in 2018. Kendall keeps it simple for this Rent the Runway event, opting for long, middle-parted hair, low-key makeup, and a short black jumpsuit — all of which scream, "let me walk down your runway, k thx." Kendall still wears affordable brands as she becomes more and more fashion-forward. Proof? Steve Madden designed the platform stilettos she wears to this Seventeen magazine party. Baby's first bandage dress! Kendall opts for a lemon-colored bodycon number by CelebBoutique for a book launch in Australia.  Pay attention to this Badgley Mischka look, because it's a) one of the earliest examples of Kendall truly going all-out on the red carpet, and b) a favorite she'll recreate later in her fashion journey. Kendall officially ditches the frills and begins to favor more structured, modern silhouettes — like this asymmetrical skirt and sleeveless top by Australian designer Keepsake.  Kendall reverts to her go-to beauty look: minimal makeup and a middle part. Again, she favors clothing that highlights craftsmanship and clean lines, vs, well, what she wore at Coachella. Which brings us to... Here, Kendall ditches the designer duds for Converse and cut-offs. She also opts for a big nose ring, but, you know, it's Coachella.  For her first Met Gala, Kendall keeps things relatively safe with a strapless Champagne-colored ball gown — and has Topshop design it. She does, however, up the glam factor by wearing 82 carats of Chopard diamonds around her neck. After slaying her first Met Gala, Kendall hops over to France for Cannes and nails it in a Chanel dress, a Chanel clutch, and Chopard jewels. Honestly, this look is perfection. It's a new era! Here, Kendall dares to be a little (or a lot) sexy on the red carpet, wearing a long-sleeve Fausto Puglisi gown with hip bone-bearing slits that reach almost to her belly button.  By now, Ken's walking the Chanel runways, and her fashion game gets a little edgier, with a leather jacket, fur, and hip sneaks. Kendall hits the amfAR gala wearing a bright-red Romona Kevezadress with a MAJOR leg slit. She styles her hair almost the exact same way she did when she wore a similar gown in 2013.  Kendall experiments with blonde hair for a Balmain party in 2016 (yes, it's a wig), pairing the look with a blush-pink corset and a white, fuzzy turtleneck.  Hair tendrils? Check! Middle part? Check! Naked dress? Check! Insane DSquared2 shoes that I need to own but tragically never will? Check! Basically, Kendall's look at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards ticked every style box.  Kendall's Met Gala style has gotten edgier and edgier over the years, but the form-fitting Atelier Versace gown she wears in 2016 is the perfect balance of sexy and sophisticated.  In which Kendall Jenner single-handedly makes newsboy caps happen. And velvet booties. And wavy lobs. And mini purses. This outfit includes, for reasons no one will fully understand, a massive cowboy hat. At the Met Gala, Kendall wears her most daring dress yet, a completely sheer La Perla gown, sans underwear, that exposes her entire butt. And yes, she pulls off this look flawlessly.  Kendall Jenner officially can wear anything and make it cool, as evidenced by the fact that she's literally sporting a fanny pack while wandering around NYC.  Kendall rocks yet another naked dress, this time by Dolce & Gabbana, but decides to do something a lil' different with her hair, opting for an Old Hollywood faux bob. Vintage-inspired glamour at its finest.  Welp, Kendall has never looked better. For the 2018 Met Gala, she wears a crisp Off-White jumpsuit — but the best part of this look just might be her crazy-long ponytail.  Kendall's come a long way since those pink leggings! Here she is at Cannes, wearing a Schiaparelli Haute Couture naked dress with her hair in those signature tendrils.

			 I actually bought the clothes you see in the ads on your feed. So...how good are they in real life? Ever feel like Instagram knows what you love more than you even do? Yeah, me too. Which is why, at this point, my feed is overrun with ads for cheap, cute clothes by brands that seem to have cropped up overnight. I double-tap and wonder: Do I need these in my life or are they just fashion thirst traps? They’re so chic looking, but they’re also so affordable. Are they too good to be true? In the name of my wardrobe science, I bought a bunch of Insta-famous clothes to find out.  @dressedinlala Boiler suits are having a moment right now, so I thought I’d get in on the trend with this number from the appropriately named L.A.-chic label Dressed in Lala. The jumpsuit looked light enough to wear on a nice spring day and structured enough to hold its shape. It’s cute, but the material is ultra-heavy and a tad scratchy. I’d still keep it though, because I liked how it looked with this li’l belt bag. @fashionnova   Whether you’ve seen it on Cardi B or Kris Jenner, you’re def familiar with this brand—Fashion Nova is the most famous and affordable trendy clothing label on the ’gram.  If you can get past some minor construction issues (take a look at the close-up of the seam below to see what I mean), the great fit and fun print on this vacay-worthy piece earns it at least one pic in front of a mural wall.   @getchoosy After Fashion Nova, Choosy is probably the most popular #InstaBrand. It prides itself on recreating sexy, trendy clothes that look like the ones you’ve seen on tons of celebs.  As for this plunging shirtdress, I’ve got no complaints. It feels high-quality, and the construction is amazing. Underneath the tie in the front, a double layer of buttons and loopholes makes sure it all stays in place. @neverfullydressed Never Fully Dressed serves up funky mixed prints—perfect for someone who loves to stand out—and I was so excited about this colorful wrap.  Unforch, this dress is pretty shapeless unless you do weird bendy things with your body when you pose to give it more oomph. I decided to untie it and wear it as a duster, which looked pretty good. (FYI: The jeans below are by Fashion Nova, and they are legit.)  @selfie_leslie Selfie Leslie’s clothes are made for blogger-style pic posing, IMO. But I have to say: The quality of each piece varies.   I tried on one embroidered mini that looked and felt awesome. And then there was this gown. It looks great in pictures, but many of the stars and moons—which seemed to be just stickers—wouldn’t make it to the end of the night. In the 30 minutes it took me to put the dress on and snap pics, we lost about 15 of ’em. The verdict: It’s cute, but won’t last forever, prob.

			 Bikinis? Who needs 'em! You don't need a two-piece for a steamy beach look. Plunging necklines, open backs, and a whole lot of cutouts make these one-piece swimsuits sexier than even the tiniest bikinis. Scroll on to shop! This smocked, bright-orange number is sure to get you noticed at the beach. Oh yeah, this is one neckline that goes way, way down. But here's the great thing: because of the strings that hold it together, it'll stay in place and prevent wardrobe malfunctions.  This retro-inspired asymmetrical suit has the underboob cutout of your dreams. The stripes make it trendy, the zipper, once unzipped a 'lil, makes it super steamy. Some one-pieces show just as much skin as a bikini—this red cross-over design is no exception. If you want to take the plunge, both literally and figuratively, then please get yourself this yellow and white stunner. Leopard print is always sexy, and this high-cut, low-neckline, scooped back design proves that point. Don't let the higher crewneck of this style fool you—the side cutouts of this suit are hot as hell. This colorful style includes a tie at the back and bow details at each leg. The crochet plunging neckline adds a little extra interest to this otherwise simple black piece. High-cut? Belt? Plunging neck and scooped back? Looks like a majorly hot '80s moment to me! This white and red piece with side cutouts is giving off serious Pretty Woman energy. Super low sides mean ample opportunity to show off your side-boob. Keyhole cutouts, spaghetti straps, high-cut legs, and a square neckline give this design a sexy '90s feel.  Gotta love a frilly shoulder-baring look with an extra sultry lace-up detail! The circular tortoise-shell details of this bright suit's straps give it an elevated vibe. Nothing's sexier than a major strappy moment and this bright white design definitely delivers. This multi-colored suit features serious cutout action and a fun bow detail.

			 Royal fashion, but make it comfy. Kate Middleton's shoe collection is truly massive (so many sensible pumps, so little time), but there's one pair she comes back to over and over again: her favorite Superga 2750 Cotu Sneakers, which she was last seen wearing in August paired with navy blue trousers and a colorful peplum shirt. The event in question? The inaugural King’s Cup regatta, naturally. Anyway, if you, too, are looking for a new pair of comfortable walking (or sailing, lol) shoes, these lace-up sneakers fit the bill. A durable, rubber sole? Check. A wide, rounded toe box? Check. A soft, breathable cotton upper? Check. The best part is you can snag a pair on Amazon for as little as $25.75 this Black Friday, and choose from 36 different styles and colors. FYI, This isn’t the first time the Duchess of Cambridge has sported these sneakers. Earlier this summer, Kate wore them to the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show, where she unveiled her Back to Nature project. For the appearance, the duchess wore the white kicks with a lightweight, white button-down shirt and a pair of tan culottes.  We’re loving the Kate's casual, laid-back style—a nice change from her more polished looks!

			 Super soft. Super cute. Bralettes—you know 'em and you love 'em! So you should probably listen up, because Everlane, the beloved eco-friendly fashion label, is on a mission to serve up one of the most comfy—and affordable!—versions of the style.    Launching today, Everlane's first-ever bralette collection (described as "the bra that goes under everything") retails for just $24.

It’s time. #LoveYourUnderwear A post shared by  Everlane (@everlane) on Mar 26, 2018 at 8:47am PDT  "Underwear should be made for you. But for decades, it’s been designed with someone else in mind," the brand wrote. "Bras that push, pad, and squeeze. Fabrics that suffocate. Lace that chafes. The industry has made billions telling women that in order to feel sexy, they need to look like something they’re not. But times are changing—and so should our underwear."  The brand added that its new underwear is not only "healthy on your skin," but was created in a factory dedicated to ethical manufacturing, so you can actually feel good about your purchase.

			 Aka the king of the lil polo logo.    Ralph Lauren is one of the most iconic names in fashion—his eponymous brand launched in 1968—and now, he’s about to get the real movie-star treatment. HBO announced it’s releasing a documentary about the industry legend titled Very Ralph, which will debut on November 12. The doc, directed and produced by Susan Lacy, will feature interviews with Lauren, in which he reflects on his beginnings in the Bronx as a young boy and how his name became synonymous with American style. (Proof: He even creates Team USA’s very patriotic Olympic uniforms.)  His family and friends—including Anna Wintour, the late Karl Lagerfeld, Hillary Clinton, Naomi Campbell, Martha Stewart, Diane von Furstenberg, Jessica Chastain, and more—have also interviewed for the feature-length flick.  
  @ralphlauren cafe photographed by @kevintachman 💛🎞 A post shared by  Bella (@bellahadid) on Feb 8, 2019 at 2:15pm PST  Also, a fun fact for ya: Lauren is the first designer who established an all-encompassing lifestyle brand, expanding into home furnishings including bedding, bath products, dinnerware, and other decor. (Which is all just as stylish and sophisticated as his clothing and accessories, FYI.) His other ventures include his own super-swanky restaurant, The Polo Bar, in New York City (I mean, it’s right on Fifth Avenue, so you *know* it’s fancy) AND his own coffee shop, Ralph’s Coffee, located inside his flagship store on the Upper East Side. He Does. It. All.   Friday night drinks on a Thursday. 📷 @thenewpotato #thepolobar A post shared by  The Polo Bar (@thepolobar) on Mar 7, 2019 at 1:47pm PST Designer-focused docs seem to be on the rise recently: Celebration, about designer Yves Saint Laurent, hit screens in November of last year; McQueen, which reflected on the work, personal life, and emotional state of Alexander McQueen throughout his life, premiered on Netflix the same year; and Halston, about Roy Halston Frowick, whose fans included the likes of Jackie Kennedy and Lauren Bacall, was released in January 2019.  Very Ralph will be available to stream on HBO NOW, HBO GO, and HBO On Demand.  STREAM IN NOVEMBER

			 Here’s exactly what you need for all of the workouts.  We’ve come a long way since our Soffe shorts days (praise be).  But in 2019, we face a crisis more stressful than doing crunches in teeny-tiny cheer shorts: Too. Many. Legging. Options. Even Soffe sells ’em now.  To make this way easier for you, we searched the interwebs and found the best legging brands in the land, no matter your workout. Let’s get it going. The super-stretchy, smooth, sweat-wicking Full-On Luxtreme fabric will keep you chill when your abs are on fire. These were basically made for steamy flows. You’ll get tight compression with light-feeling HeatGear fabric (read: polyester and elastane) plus flat seams to prevent chafing, mesh panels, AND anti-odor technology. What can’t this fancy material do? First off: pockets. We could stop now, but there’s more. Mesh panels wrap around the legs to let your skin breathe as you log miles. We should also probs mention that the reflective logo is perfect for night runs—or just looking cool on the treadmill. If you’re in the mood for yoga, you’re def in the mood for some self-care. Enter, these crazy-soft and cozy leggings. They are real stretchy (four-way stretch FTW), pull sweat away from your bod, and are so effing cute you might buy that unlimited month of classes after all. PSA: Spanx makes workout leggings! While you let that info sink in, here’s why they’re awesome. They’re super compression-y (new word alert), so all that junk stays in your trunk mid-squat. Oh, and their matching sets are actually very sexy. Trust. These pants are here to save you the next time your instructor yells at you for texting in class (haters gonna hate) with a sneaky back pocket that HOLDS YOUR PHONE. Besides that magic trick, the nylon, Lycra, and poly-blend fabric keeps you cool in that dark, hot room. These leggings are your jam when you don’t know exactly what exercises you’ll be doing until you get to class. With just the right amount of compression, a high-as-hell waistband, and patented Dri-FIT fabric, you’ll be set even if your instructor throws surprise burpees at you. When you’re planning to get in, sweat your ass off, and get out, you need you some mesh paneling. This pair features the perforated fabric around your thighs and the backs of your legs (aka drip central). Also, so cute, right? These color-block beauties feature four-way stretch, sweat-wicking, compression-centric fabric AND include UV protection for your stems as you wander through nature things. When you’re shaking it to Sean Paul, you need a legging that’s equally fun. But there’s more to this pretty pair than good looks. The high-rise waist holds you in place as you kick and strut your way through class. We’ll see you in the front row. TFW you want to look like you are about to head to the gym at any moment...but actually have big plans for mimosas and bagels. You know it well. These crazy-comfy leggings from Alala are totally seamless (read: feel amazing) and include mesh for more air flow. Did you just become a fitness influencer? Yup.

Toxin-free and extra-soft diapers are a must for babies, and new parents will totally appreciate a subscription—i.e., they won’t have to leave the house when they inevitably have to stock up on more. They can mix multiple sizes and designs within the same box and select from a range of delivery frequencies. From setting alarms for middle-of-the-night feedings to getting in her steps once she’s ready to be active again, this watch will be mom’s constant companion. She can also set the camera timer from the phone to take fun photos with her baby. This set has everyday necessities: NoseFrida (also known as the snot sucker), Windi (yep...to relieve gas), NailFrida (for trimming the tiniest nails), and MomWasher (for postpartum cleaning). Did I say I was getting real? I meant it. This diaper bag is perfect for travel and truly has a place for everything: eight interior compartments like stand-up side pockets for bottles, snacks, and supplies; laptop storage; and nine exterior side pockets for your wallet, keys, and easy-access needs. Since it fits everything she has for the baby at home, this style also works as a carry-on. Don’t know the gender yet? A neutral-color gift that includes two onesies, a hat, and a swaddling blanket is perfect for a baby shower. She’ll love cuddling with her newborn with this cozy, cotton, square-shape blanket. Treat her to a sparkly 14k gold charm that she can add to a delicate chain. The perfect gift to bring baby home from the hospital. In the first few months, baby socks are so tiny and impossible to keep on their feet. Baby fingernails can scratch their faces. This romper has convertible mittens and booties that can be folded down in the first delicate months, then folded back once the baby is moving around more. The set also comes with the cutest hat and onesie. Keep new moms up to date on all things pop culture, fashion, beauty, and astrology. FYI, newborns see in high-contrast black and white for the first three months. A two-sided play mat featuring polka dots as well as colorful, brighter hues will grow with the baby as they develop. Packing food for daycare requires an insulated bag that’s easy to wipe clean. Parkland bags are made from 100 percent recycled fabrics and come in a variety of fun prints. Convertible car seats are important because it’s an investment and needs to be useful for a while. As the baby grows and changes from back- to front-facing, it’s essential to find a safe, comfortable car seat that can grow WITH the baby. Bath time is the most special time of day with a new baby. These cozy hooded towels make sure baby gets dry and also makes for a priceless Instagram pic. Clean with clean! Products for all areas of the home that are safe with a baby around are essential for new moms. This subscription service allows mom to set it and forget it, because who wants to worry about ordering more laundry pods?? Packing her hospital bag with all the essentials is crucial for helping a new mom feel at home in those first moments with baby. This marble print carryall holds enough for a multiple day stay for mom and all the clothes she will need for the babe as well.  Soon there will be toys EVERYWHERE. These macrame baskets will keep them all contained. This 4-in-1 wallet comes with a wristlet and a cross-body strap. Mom can throw it in her bag or use it hands-free for quick grocery runs. As a bonus, you can get it monogrammed! New mom life means spending a lot of time at home, so snacks are essential. Healthy treats are super important to stay well nourished while she’s getting used to her new companion. This is quite possibly the single most useful chair for any newborn. It helps them sit up after eating, and it folds flat for easy transportation and storage. Learning how to breastfeed (if that’s what she chooses to do) is sometimes challenging for new moms. Lactation cookies to the rescue! No really, they’re a thing. These have natural ingredients that enhance milk supply and are delicious enough that the whole family will want to eat them. New moms will love a mesmerizing waterfall of glitter. This phone case can be monogrammed for extra charm. The high chair is an important purchase because it must be versatile enough to grow with your baby and fit seamlessly into your home. From infant to toddler, this chair will remain useful and is stylish enough to have at the dining table. Designed with rechargeable light-up soles, these shoes will make kids feel like they’re glowing. And they’ll never run out of energy because there’s a rechargeable USB port in the tongue. An on-the-go diaper clutch that looks like a regular ole cross-body? Yes, please. This one has convenient compartments for holding wipes and diapers to get rid of spit-up and any other “accidents.” This stroller and carseat muff is essential for cold-weather climates. It blocks the wind and keeps the little one warm from infancy through preschool, thanks to its handy zippered length and width extenders. The Story of You will certainly be the item her baby will cherish when they are an adult. For parents, it’s a perfect place to keep all those memories that sleepless nights might make difficult to remember! Being a new mom means getting less sleep. Cute sunnies with tinted lenses are an excellent solution for the inevitable days of tired eyes. Gift her a set of two crib sheets and a baby blanket. Both are organic cotton so she can rest easy too while her little one is sleeping. There can never be enough cozy sweaters when you are a new mom. (The more the merrier because she’s definitely being spit up on multiple times a day.) Pamper new moms with a classy shave kit. It’s the little luxuries that make self-care possible in new-mom life. This kit has everything needed to get started, including a wall mount so it can live in your shower without getting rusty. The blades are engineered for a woman’s body, and the handle comes in a variety of fun colors. Flowers come and go, but succulents are forever. This set of four comes in a variety of fun mismatched pots. It sounds simple, but it’s actually very useful: An insulated bottle carrier keeps milk at the right temp and prevents it from spilling over everything. You can clip it onto any bag or stroller so the bottle is ready instantly when inevitable meltdowns happen. This handmade felt design for the baby’s room features swans but is also available in other animals. It adds a decorative touch to the nursery, and her baby will feel so relaxed gazing up at it. She can prepare raw, uncooked fruit, veggies, and meat in this steam cooker and blender that makes perfectly pureed portions for her little one. If there’s a part of her face that’ll feel the new lack of sleep the most, it’s her under-eye area. These firming gels will get rid of dark circles and bags super fast. This cute little creature watches over the baby while the parents are in another room.

			 “I do not need any more sweatpants.” —No one  In high school, I joined the track team for the sweatpants. From that point on, Sporty Spice (or Lazy Spice, depending how you spin it) became my signature lewk.  It took a while, but eventually, notable fashion people like, IDK, the Kardashian-Jenners and Hadids got on my level, making sweats acceptable for all situations. While I pride myself on a fully stocked athleisure drawer, there was one item missing from my catalogue of comfy pants: fashun sweats.  Enter, Amazon.  If you follow Colette Prime—and you definitely should—you know Amazon has lots of very stylish, very affordable pieces. BUT as I was pleased to discover, the retailer taking over the world also has a killer selection of chillin’ styles that cost about as much as I’m willing to pay for such clothes.  And that brings me to my new favorites: Amazon’s SweatyRocks sweatpants (aka Women’s Drawstring Waist Long Workout Yoga Active Pant With Pocket, in Amazon speak).  Here’s why I’m never taking them off. I wore my brand-new pants on a brunch date with my super-stylish bestie (linked to emphasize her fashun expertise) and the first thing she said was, “You look so cute!” Fam, I was wearing sweatpants! To be fair, I styled them up a bit with a cropped hoodie, high-top sneakers, a camel coat, and a shower.  While my collection of cotton-based pants needed a little color, there are plenty of neutral options that are perfect for mixing and matching with things you already own.  
  While the fabric is about 65 percent polyester, 30 percent cotton, and 5 percent spandex, my legs felt surprisingly cool from brunch to running errands on a 60-degree day. Also, less cotton means less shrinkage in the dryer.  Because I’m not a person who grocery shops in her brunch finest, I made a pit stop at home to change into a more durable (read: not white) sweatshirt before doing my Sunday routine. Even though I was dressed down, I felt like a bad bitch while scoping out the organic kale and confident enough to snap this pic in an extra-shiny window on the way home. Think of all the things you can buy while wearing these budget-friendly pants! Pasta (elastic waist FTW!), friends to take your picture wearing cool pants, or 30 Tide to Go pens for when you inevitably spill on these because you’re wearing them all the time. If you have long legs, you good. If not, maybe size down one or two slots so that the elastic ankle cuff (is that the proper terminology here?) hits right at or above your ankle bone. I ordered a small and could have ordered an extra small (again, elastic waist FTW).  I am in love and very likely to wear this exact outfit to every brunch from now until I order these pants in green.

			 Sweater season is coming,  y'all! Everyone knows the main reason to love fall is all the sweaters, scarves, booties, and transitional jackets. Scroll on for all the autumn outfit inspiration you’ll need to look fresh this season. Wide-leg pants are the office equivalent of pajamas, so go ahead and get roomy and totally comfy in an acid wash pair. Then, monochrome it up with a tonal blouse and neutral shoes. Feel the neutral vibes in a taupe jacket paired with a white tee and striped linen pants. Then add mustard heels for an extra pop of fall color. Storms, but make 'em not get in the way of your cute ’fit. A sheer vinyl jacket will keep you protected from any inclement weather, but also able to show off whatever is underneath. Might I suggest a cute floral top and some mid-wash mom jeans? Everyone loves a coordinating set, and a denim one in a fun window-pane pattern will get you all the stares come fall. If the athletic vibe’s your thing, get to know this color-blocked windbreaker set, which you can pair with a crop top if you feel like showing a little skin, or a T-shirt if you’re not so into that.  Can you even deal with the cute frill details on these sleeves? I personally cannot. Love this look with the slide-on black heels. All-white outfits for all year round is the hill I will die on and this one looks fabulous paired with a patchwork denim jacket.  For those days in the beginning of fall when it’s actually still warm out but you’re ~feeling~ the autumnal color scheme, go for a mustard dress paired with a cream crochet bag. Best part about a jumpsuit is it’s a one and done. Throw it on and you got yourself a full outfit. This leopard one goes great with a pair of strappy block sandals and a pretty macramé bag.  You definitely have to wear an olive utility jacket come fall. This one goes great with a pair of distressed jeans, a button-down tank, and a cognac-colored bag.  What is fall without a chic sweater dress? This one is great because it has added flirty details, like a knot-front and a one-shoulder cutout. The jacket that’s definitely missing from your wardrobe? A mauve-colored cord one that's oversized and pairs perfectly with dark-wash jeans and sneakers.  Check out how cute this jumpsuit looks with a pair of minimalist white heels and lucite hoops. A silk miniskirt will be your fave new fall item, especially when paired with a neutral knit top and a buttery faux-leather jacket. For those days when fall is inexplicably warm, go with a breezy, brighter dress that will remind you of those summer days. A pair of coordinating sneakers will complete those low-key vibes you're going for. Hello, perfect layers! Throwing a duster over your high-waisted shorts and tank will keep you from freezing in those dwindling temps. Fall weddings won’t know what hit ’em when you show up in this pretty formal maxi! But you can also dress this piece way down with a jean jacket and white tennis shoes. Elevated raincoat game = upgraded with this vinyl trench. Just add the sheer turtle below and a pair of white pants. Yes to this simple but very flirty look that will take you from the office to date night in no time flat. During the day, make it work appropriate with a blazer on top. At night, take that baby off and replace with a bomber. Say hiiiii to this very sunshiney fall inspo! Love a mustard and camel combo, and you will too.  Throw a jean jacket over this pretty patterned jumpsuit, or wear a long-sleeve tee beneath it for colder days. Meet the perfect fall dress—mid-length and long-sleeved so you’re covered and cozy but showing just enough skin to keep it sassy. Giving this see-through animal-print tourist shirt an A for awesome, especially when paired with these white jeans and a black mini bag. Leopard-print midi skirts were all the rage this summer, but once fall comes around, it’ll be all about other patterns, including this fun frond one! Pair this cute skirt with a rust-colored blouse and a woven bucket bag for a fresh but definitely autumnal vibe. Coordination is key when it comes to this ruffly look.  ICYMI, a shaket is a shirt-jacket hybrid and I need this olive-green one, stat. Honestly, pair this with anything in the fall and you’ll look fab, but I love it with this simple shorts and tee ’fit.  This light-hued burnt orange two-piece will give you life this fall, especially when paired with coordinating white accessories. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Fall is perfect jeans and T-shirt weather, so don’t overthink it! A medium-wash tapered pair with a graphic tee is just as chic as it ever was.

			 It's so easy to make mistake #8. Summer is coming, which means swimsuit season is upon us. Cue the endless bullsh*t about how to "flatter your figure." You won't find that here. Instead, I'm going to tell you that you should wear whatever you want! Even so, people tend to make some key mistakes when choosing a bathing suit to wear to the beach. Scroll on to find out what they are and how to fix them. Yes, that bikini was super cute in the days of yore, but I've got news for you: Swimsuits are made of elastic, and elastic stretches out over time, with multiple wears. If you have a go-to piece you're always sporting, it may be time to say goodbye to it and hello to something new. Or, you know, buy the same style again — I'm not going to judge you. I'm just trying to prevent saggy butt syndrome. SHOP NOW Nikki Top, TULAROSA (Available at Revolve), $78 If, like many women before you, you wear the same suit for everything from sunbathing to surfing, I'm here to tell you, "Please stop doing that." Why? Because if you're going to be super active paddle boarding, jumping into the water, or swimming laps, you don't want your bikini to untie or your top to come off as soon as you hit the water. Sporty styles exist for exactly this reason! They offer support and will stay secure in more athletic situations. And, yes, they're still super cute! Check out the one below to see what I mean. SHOP NOW Gemma Top, L*SPACE (Available at Revolve), $88 Fuller-bust ladies, this one's for you. There are tons of cute styles that have support — and no, not all of them are balconette bra designs! Look for wider bands and straps when you shop, or try this piece below! SHOP NOW Supportive Mixed Gingham Pom Pom Bardot Bikini Top, ASOS FULLER BUST, $26 One-pieces can be a little matronly, but not all of them are. Very pretty, trendy, and even super sexy styles exist if you know where to look. I'm a big fan of Urban Outfitters, Revolve, and indie label Lauren Layne Swim for sexy, affordable styles. Consider this one: SHOP NOW The Cypress, LAUREN LAYNE SWIM, $120 Again, trying to prevent saggy butt syndrome here. Many women — my past self included — have bought bottoms or one-pieces a size larger than they needed to prevent bulging. But really, what you're doing when you size up is asking for your suit to sag when you come out of the pool, or even come off as you dive in. Swimsuits stretch over time, so this problem is just going to get worse as you wear it. When you try on your style, move around in it, and make sure everything stays exactly where it should be when you do — that's the mark of a piece that fits well. SHOP NOW Tropical Print Bikini Breif, BOOHOO (Available at ASOS), $13 B.S.! Bikinis look good on everyone, and you should try one out if you've never worn one before. If you're a conservative dresser who doesn't want to show quite as much skin, consider a high-waisted piece. Your friends will love your cute, new retro look. SHOP NOW Darla Bottom, TULAROSA (Available at Revolve), $78 Sure, you love your triangle top and cheeky bottoms — that's fine! But there's no harm in testing out different silhouettes at a store. This is the perfect time to try a trendy one-shoulder style, a bandeau, or a strappy 'lil something-something. SHOP NOW Zahara Top, KOPPER & ZINK (Available at Revolve), $120 This is a big one that lots of people make. Buying a two-piece set sometimes can seem more economical, but most people aren't the same size on top and on bottom. This can leave you either with gaping or too-full breast cups, a saggy butt, or leg holes that cut off your circulation. Bad, bad, bad. The solution, of course, is to mix and match styles. You can even mix and match brands! Different patterns or colors for your top and bottom is NBD — and sometimes, it's even cuter than a matching set. SHOP NOW High-Cut Bikini Bottoms, FOREVER 21, $16 Some of the cutest suits out there are a mess of straps and cutouts, and you might be missing out on a super fun style just because you're worried about potentially weird tan lines. You know what you can do? Stick an umbrella over you while you're at the pool or the beach, or apply a sport-proof, SPF-50-or-more sunblock as prescribed, every 80 minutes. That'll keep the crazy lines at bay. SHOP NOW Mesh Panel Bikini Bottoms, FOREVER 21, $16 Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Someone call the fire department because these two are SMOKING.  Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner's weekends were absolutely filled with bikini pics, because, like you and me, they're probably trying to soak up every last bit of summer. Kourt, who's fresh off her alleged split from Younes Bendjima, has been using her newfound free time to document her swimwear on Instagram. She looks amazing, and wow! Not a passive aggressive comment in sight.  First, she took a steamy (and, TBH, grainy) video in which she's casually lounging on a staircase in front of a huge mirror. She accessorized with a black baseball cap and white sneakers, and in the video, zoomed in on her high-cut bright red one-piece.  The next day, she wore a lime green, barely-there bikini by Gooseberry Intimates.   sweet sunday 🍭 A post shared by  Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Aug 19, 2018 at 7:25pm PDT Kourt captioned the pic "sweet sunday," and TBH, laying poolside on a lounge chair does seem pretty sweet.  Not to be left out, Kendall also got in on the swimwear action with two Instagram stories. They featured her posing in front of a mirror in her best bikinis—and also showing her ridiculously-toned abs and serious underboob.   Like Kourt, her neon green bikini was also by Gooseberry Intimates and had a high-cut silhouette. Next, she documented a neutral swim look with ruffled edges and ties on the side, complete with a pizza GIF sticker.  She recently went on a romantic beach vacation/couples retreat to Mexico with rumored BF Ben Simmons and her sister Khloé and Tristan Thompson, so basically I'm not even sure if she owns any other clothes besides swimwear at this point.

			 All the inspo you need, right this way.  There are a lot of things to worry about when you’re a teen—homework, tests, prom drama, the stress of figuring out what to do with your life when you graduate, and, yes, even coming up with an epic Halloween costume idea. Whether you’re in junior high or high school, there are TONS of ideas out there. Your school might even allow you to dress up if Halloween is on the weekday, or your classmate might be throwing a spooky get-together at their place. Whatever the case may be, here are 25 teen Halloween costume ideas to get you started, whether you are crafty and want to make your own outfit, you don’t have a creative bone in your body, you want to go solo, or you want to dress up with a group of friends to make it a memorable (and scary!) night. Go as a good ol’ pirate! Accessorize with an eye patch, a silk blouse, and harem pants.  Make sure to watch some makeup tutorials on YouTube for this one. Add some glitter and sparkles, and def don’t forget a flower crown!   Dress up as the guardian of justice and love with a yellow wig, sailor costume, and white gloves.  Dress up like Post Malone and your costume will definitely be “better now.” (Sorry.) Draw on some face tats with eyeliner and put on some funky sunglasses and you’re a rap star.  You can do it! Grab inspiration from the iconic poster of Rosie the Riveter. A chambray button-down, a red bandanna, and a red lip make this a super-easy yet classic costume.  Everything is better with some sparkle. Do up your makeup with glitter and a hot-pink lip. Then add that horn headband to make the magic happen. Bonus points if you dye your hair a matching pink to complete the gorgeous transformation.  Feel like a “Dangerous Woman” this Halloween season in your favorite pop star’s stage look. Don’t forget to shop the chic black lace bunny ears.  Leotards for days! Accessorize with light-up sneakers to make the look even more extra.  Tell me about it, stud. Sandy from Grease is an iconic costume to try. Grab a pair of faux-leather leggings, a black off-the-shoulder top, and red heels for this look.  Under the sea! Dress like a mermaid with scale-patterned leggings, seashell details, and a crown, then go crazy with the sparkly blue makeup for this one.  Cute and pink—what’s not to like? Minnie Mouse is an adorable way to get noticed. If you don’t want to commit to the whole outfit, you can always throw on a pair of ears to get the point across.  If you love dressing in all white, this is for you.  “As if!” I care how much candy I’m going to eat tonight. Try this classic plaid costume with your bestie. Kudos if you still have your old flip phone to use as a prop.  Spice up your night! Grab your girls and sing your fave ’90s jams all night long.  Commit to the ’70s vibe with fringe pieces, floral dresses, and flares to complete this look. Make sure you add a headband over wavy hair and throw up some peace signs for the ’gram.  This scene of Regina Woods in Mean Girls is epic. Cut holes in an inexpensive white tank top, wear a purple bra or tank underneath, and that’s it. Really.  Be a Barbie girl in a Barbie world and dress as the timeless dolls with these retro looks à la Beyoncé and Jay-Z.  Zedis lapedis! Go out of this universe (or at least get some space leggings) and have fun with jewel makeup application.  Go all out with colorful wigs and form-fitting clothes, and always, ALWAYS look candid in your Halloween pics. (Even if they’re not actually candid.)  *snap, snap* Morticia Addams is a classic costume to try for Halloween, and it’s actually way simple to achieve. Opt for a black dress and pale foundation with a black smokey eye and red lip for this one.  Cargo pants, a black crop top, and gloves make this costume, but the red wig is definitely key. Everyone’s gonna be calling you, beeping you, etc.  Opt for an inexpensive tutu skirt with a coordinating tank top, then  lace up those pointe shoes and put your hair in an elegant updo.  5, 6, 7, 8! This cheerleading costume is an easy purchase online, and you can just throw on white shoes you already own.  Sugar, spice, and everything nice. Either go solo or get two of your friends to join in on this fun throwback costume.  “Just Dance” the night away as Lady Gaga in a short blonde wig, oversize sunglasses, fishnets, and a bunch of clear balloons glued to you.

			 Very interesting turn of events. If you thought the constant analysis of Meghan Markle's style would dissipate post-wedding, boy, were you wrong! Just one day after speculation on her shoe size was rampant, we're now on to her purse choices, because, apparently, they've changed since she's gotten married. As you know, royal handbags are way more than just handbags — as royal experts have been known to say, Meghan 🚨 breaks protocol 🚨 with her bag choices all the time. If you didn't know that, here's a little back story: According to Harper's Bazaar, "The Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge are often seen with clutches or bags with a small handle — which they will then often grasp with two hands — to avoid shaking hands with people with whom it might be awkward."  Meghan, at least before her wedding, was often seen wearing cross-body bags that allow both of her hands to be free. But on at least three occasions since getting hitched, she's opted for clutches or designs with just a small handle. One stylist interviewed by the Daily Mail chocks this change up to the standards of her new in-laws: "Before Meghan became part of the royal family, she definitely had a much more relaxed, casual sense of style. Now that she is part of the royal family, she has to adapt her style to fit that. I think Meghan has taken some inspiration from Kate [Middleton] but is putting her own spin on it." She adds, "Clutch bags look much more elegant than her trusted crossbody bag and add a more traditional, classic regal style." On top of the whole hands-free thing, the stylist makes a point to say that Meghan's most recent bags are from high-fashion designers like Givenchy and Wilbur & Gussie, rather than the more casual, indie labels she was wearing before.

			 When your dress is just as shiny as an Oscar.  Lupita Nyong'o showed UP to the Oscars red carpet in a gold chainmail Versace number with a very high leg slit. The Black Panther star looked super glam in the sparkling dress, which featured black accents and embellishments across the bodice and ending at the hip. She paired the stunning gown with simple black heels and a matching gold clutch.   Nyong'o also wore dark eyeshadow and a neutral lip, accessorizing with silver earrings and a gold hair piece that was woven throughout her 'do. It's really all about the details, people, and if anyone knows how to rock a hair accessory, it's Lupita.  She posed on the red carpet with her Black Panther co-star, Danai Gurira, who opted for a blush strapless dress.

			 Guarantee you’ll find your new go-to here.  With fall quickly approaching (emphasis on QUICKLY, like, Labor Day is almost here!!!) the time is near to break out all your coats. But if you’re in desperate need of new styles and want a primer on all the types, we’ve rounded ’em all up for you. Yes, sometimes they seem the same, but the length, cut, closures, and material can all make a big difference in how it actually looks on your body.  Another confusing thing is the distinction between coats and jackets⁠—I mean, we all use them pretty interchangeably without much thought—but coats are typically longer and hit at your thighs or lower, whereas jackets usually end at your waist. But then again, there are cropped coats and long jackets, so what is the truth?!?! Anyway, below are generally the different kinds of coats and jackets you need to know about (if you don’t already do).  These are the ultimate transitional piece between winter and spring, and they feature buttons and a belted waist that you can adjust or tie. Usually they’re in shades of tan and khaki, but you can find ’em in other shades too.  Want to feel like you have a blanket around you at all times? That’s where faux-fur coats come in, because, dang, are they cozy. With these, you can get that super-soft fur feel but still feel good about wearing it out.  While peacoats are usually double-breasted (meaning that they have two columns of buttons), this one still has its signature wide collar and front pockets. (And having this same exact one, I can attest that it is simply the best coat.)  Like the name suggests, these are a longer overcoat style and have a sleek, simple silhouette. This one with its single button, knee-length, and textured sleeve details is undoubtedly chic.  Loose-fitting and breezy, a duster is usually left open so it swings with each step. If you're more drawn to oversize silhouettes, this gorge corduroy one is calling your name.   These have overlapping front flaps with symmetrical columns of buttons on each side, so these styles wrap a little more snug around your body for a tighter fit.  If you live in a place with brutal winters, a wool coat definitely keeps any chilly air at bay thanks to its thick, heavy fabric. But just because it’s this material doesn’t mean it can’t be cute. Take this plaid one, for instance.  It’s wind-proof and has a hood to protect against any elements. This fall-appropriate burnt orange style is not only pretty, but it also has functional pockets and secure closures.   Not all puffer coats are down, but all down coats are puffers. Get it? But what is the difference, you ask? Down styles are made specifically using duck or goose feathers for insulation (and extra fluffiness).  And now, here’s your puffer. This style has a synthetic fill for insulation. Plus, it is amazingly lightweight and can fold down super tight if you need to remove it.  If there’s only one column of buttons, then it’s single-breasted. It makes this plaid coat look minimal and elegant along with the front pockets.   Slightly oversize, this silhouette is super easy to wear over even the chunkiest knit. With this specific J.Crew coat, you can fold the collar down or keep it up for extra neck warmth.   Lookin’ for some subtle texture? Get in on these materials. Just stay away from any water or snow to avoid damage! Speaking of water and snow, you’ll want a raincoat to prevent you from getting damp and miserable. It’s also another great transitional style: wear it with sweaters in the winter and then with T-shirts when it warms up.  Ahh cashmere, arguably the fanciest of all fabrics. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s also amazingly warm while still feeling ultra lightweight.  This is similar to a faux-fur with its degree of fluffiness, but it’s closer to a coarser shearling material. While it was *the* coat of 2018, I’m betting it’ll definitely be back this winter.  Casting a net off the docks, but make it fashion, right? A toggle coat is closely associated with fishermen and has its history in the Navy. This dark blue one has a zipper underneath the closures for extra security that goes all the way to the collar.  Speaking of military origins, the bomber jacket is a classic silhouette. Worn by pilots (and now by everyone else), they’re characterized by large sleeves and fitted elastic on the cuffs, waist, and collar.  Wear it as a shirt, or wear it as a jacket! What a low-key brilliant idea. This corduroy one has loose sleeves, which are perfect for layering long sleeves and knits underneath. Plus, it also happens to have an almost perfect 5-star rating.  Just like the one your nana knits but more appropriate to wear in public. The quilted fabric feels like a dream, and it provides insulation since each little square usually includes padding.  You already know this one, duh, but it’s a staple that literally everyone needs in their closets. During colder months, invest in one that has sherpa lining, like this Levi’s one here.  Yes, this looks vaguely like a parka, but hear me out: Anoraks are shorter and have drawstrings around the waist, like this one, so they can be cinched. It’s different, okay! When you’re cruisin’ down some snow-covered slopes, you gotta have a jacket that protects against the icy wind—and any wipeouts you may have. While you can find other less-expensive versions, they can still cost ya, but it’s worth it for that sweet sweet insulation and aerodynamic silhouette.  A staple of the high school jock, a varsity jacket is like wearing your popularity over your shoulders. In all seriousness though, they are decorative and usually feature patches of your high school’s initials. You can also add pins in them for some extra flair. (Gotta make sure everyone knows you made honor roll!)  Not the best in a blizzard, but they’re pretty great if you want to make a fashion statement in cooler temps. These are worn loosely over the shoulders and have holes that you put your arms through. If you’re into accessories, you can also add a belt over styles like this.  These typically have a boxy silhouette, no shortage of pockets, and are typically made of denim or waxed canvas—i.e., durable fabrics for roughing it. If you’re hiking or camping outdoors, you def wanna add one of these to your cart.  Aka the type that needs no intro, but here it is anyway. The leather style has an asymmetrical zipper, studs on the collar, and is guaranteed to make you look like you own a motorcycle (or that you rode one at the very least).

			 Give your feet the royal treatment.    You guys, it looks like Meghan Markle's treasured Sarah Flint sandals, the Grear style in "Saddle," are finally back in stock today. Great news if you've ever tried to cop these bad boys previously only to find that they were sadly sold out. What makes them her fave shoes, you ask? Only the fact that she's worn them, like, a thousand times. Okay, maybe not a THOUSAND, but you get my drift.  She wore them twice while on her royal tour of Australia last year and she also wore them at the Audi Polo Challenge last June. Plus, she was even seen wearing them *before* she was a Duchess because they were all over her now-deleted Instagram.  
    While they aren't exactly inexpensive, they're definitely not as much as the Givenchy dresses and Aquazzura pumps she sports on some formal occasions. Need more of an incentive to snag yourself a pair? According to a press release, the last time there was a restock, they sold out in Less. Than. One. Day. While Meg is a fan of the tan colorway (which is by far the most in-demand version), the shoe is also available in white, gold, and, now, in a brand-new black hue.    Anyway, it's almost summer, and your toes deserve to be freed in these Duchess-approved sandals, right? Treat yourself!

			 The train on Beyoncé's dress is insane. Last night, Beyoncé and Blue Ivy attended the 2nd Annual Wearable Art Gala at Alexandria Ballrooms in Los Angeles, in matching dresses. The evening's theme was "From WACO to Wakanda" and everyone's outfits reflected the immense influence Black Panther has had on the world already. Beyoncé was honored for her humitarian work at the Gala, alongside her mother in-law Gloria Carter. The event was hosted by her mom, Tina Knowles Lawson, and step-dad, Richard Lawson, and it was a supremely star-studded affair. Beyoncé was accompanied by her daughter, and husband Jay Z, plus her sister Solange was also there. As usual, Blue Ivy stole the show in a stunning gold ensemble, which included a completely gold wig:  And you just have to see the train on Beyoncé's gown when she walks away, and the number of people carrying said train. It is epic to say the least: Later on in the night, Beyoncé underwent a costume change, while Blue Ivy remained completely golden, because why ruin a good thing? Michelle Obama recorded a video message which was played at the event to honor the former Destiny's Child singer: And Beyoncé was presented her award in an emotional speech by a mother whose daughter is inspired by the singer's success, and who has immensely benefited from the support of the Waco Theater Center: Accepting the award, Beyoncé tried not to cry as she revealed, "I feel really full, and just, so blessed and so very fortunate... It's a privilege and a responsibility." The singer also attended last year's Wearable Art Gala, where she wore an unforgettable flower crown of epic proportions:  💙Inaugural Wearable Art Gala in support of WACO Theater Center 💙 A post shared by  Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Apr 30, 2017 at 7:22pm PDT

Soft denim joggers that will look cute enough for weekend brunch but are comfy enough for Netflix and chill. This speaker doubles as a water bottle, which is so cool and convenient, I just can’t even. Your friend definitely wants this.

A tiger-print handbag that’s casual enough to wear every day is the perfect gift for someone who loves attention.

A body-hugging heathered sweaterdress is cozy, stylish, and sexy all in one, so they’ll definitely nail their next dinner date. I don’t know about you, but I pretty much need everything right by my bed at all times, and my bedside table is a downright mess. This little caddy would be really nice to have, so I’m guessing your friend would like one too. Are they hard on their carry-all? A new bag in a warm tan hue could be just what the doctor ordered—this one is big enough to handle pretty much anything (including a laptop) and chic enough to go with any outfit. Help them start the day off right with a super-pretty marbled coffee mug with cute gold accents.

Kate Spade started her eponymous fashion company in 1993, and even after she exited the company in 2007 to focus on raising her now-13-year-old daughter, the brand carried on with her signature colorful aesthetic and whimsical style. Here, a look back on her most memorable quotes from interviews covering everything from her 25-year-old brand to her style inspiration to her love of color. “If you’re as honest and fair as you can be, not only in business but in life, things will work out. I hope that people remember me not just as a good businesswoman but as a great friend — and a heck of a lot of fun.” – Glamour "I thought I'd be Holly Hunter from Broadcast News, behind the scenes running around really fast, paying attention to what needed to get done, and that's what I thought. I didn't grow up thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to be a designer.'" – CNN "My mother was very good at encouraging me to dress however I wanted to dress. My sisters would sometimes think, 'Oh my God, you let her buy that fuzzy leopard coat at that vintage store?' I thought, of course, I looked like Audrey Hepburn." – CNN "I find color optimistic and enthusiastic, and I adore it." – Build Series  ❤️nyc. 💕 the sam bag. A post shared by  kate spade new york (@katespadeny) on Feb 25, 2018 at 7:05am PST "I don’t think that fashion is something people encourage in a lot of schools, but I think they should — it’s all about personal expression." – The Cut "People always ask me, 'Where do you find inspiration?' and I think it's a difficult question to answer because – everywhere." – InStyle "The most fun thing that I do is working with friends and family. I would say the most challenging part is working with friends and family." – InStyle "We're a conservative company by nature. It's our personality – I come from the Midwest so the idea of recklessly spending money, even though it sounds like a lot of fun, isn't interesting to me." – CNBC "I think the details and the quality are so important that it has to have an emotional tug. Even if it's the simplest shoe, it has to have something that says, 'Oh, I have to have you." – CNBC   If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 You = stealth summer stylist. Swimsuits are so cute, sexy, and stylish these days that you shouldn't have to (and may not want to!) take them off once you leave the pool. Here's how to incorporate your bikinis and one-pieces right into your outfit so you can look hot, pack less, and spend more time enjoying the sun.   If you like to show skin, this is the best way to take your swimwear from the beach to the bar. As the models here demonstrate, you can wear your statement bathing suit beneath something mesh, chiffon, or macrame to highlight it, but you'll still feel covered. Wear a one-piece under a see-through jumpsuit, work your bikini as a crop top and pair it with mesh shorts so your bottoms show through, or style your suit under a diaphanous chiffon maxi for a little leg action. Skin is in, my friends. If these styles are a bit too bold for your taste, your version of sheer can be more low-key. Think see-through black maxi dresses with embroidered designs, mesh skirts with graphic tees, or a lace shirt with with your fave pair of jeans.  The Best Sheer Pieces to Layer Over That Bathing Suit On Bibi: Racing Logo Maxi Dress, TOMMY HILFIGER X GIGI HADID, $490; Chevron Slip On Wedge, HILFIGER COLLECTION, $190. On Diandra: The Jourdan Suit in Red Slate, SOLID & STRIPED, $168; Nikki Onesie in Fishnet, MORGAN LANE, $368; White Strass Pool Slide, ROGER VIVIER, $1,200. On Barbie: Ribbed Tie-Front Bikini Top, FOREVER 21, $20; White Heart Earrings, LARUICCI, $75; Alea Two Coin Necklace, PARPALA JEWELRY, $159; Dasha Necklace, PARPALA JEWELRY, $120   If you'd rather take your athleisure style to the pool, sporty fabrics like jersey, windbreaker, mesh, and scuba work super well with your swimsuit. Just take it from these models. One wears a striped one-piece with a pair of green shorts, a cropped polo, and an oversize windbreaker vest. The other sports an eye-catching neoprene jumpsuit (which actually is a swimsuit in itself) over a collared bikini top that adds extra edge. Admittedly, these styles are a little OTT, but the takeaway is that bright and colorful basically screams summer — don't be afraid to go for it. If you're trying the sporty look on your own, tone it down by pairing your bikini top with sweats or baggy cargo pants for a very '90s vibe, or by slipping into a plunging scuba dress with an athletic-looking suit that peeks through on top. Another way to go is to pair jeans or shorts with an '80s-style windbreaker and your bikini (worn as a crop top). The possibilities are endless. How to Sport Up Your Swimsuit On Barbie: Slash Jumpsuit, CHROMAT, $472; Hampton Bikini Top, OOKIOH, $49; Ankle Boot, FENTY PUMA BY RIHANNA, $650; Yellow Link Earrings, LARUICCI, $100. On Bibi: Ma Aku Jacket, NO KA’OI, $729, not available for purchase; Anne-Marie Suit in Primary Stripe, SOLID & STRIPED, $168; Color-Blocked Cropped Polo, HILFIGER COLLECTION, $230; Denim Short, HILFIGER COLLECTION, $190   As in, off-duty model looks. It's easy to add a suit to pretty much any outfit, even one that feels more "everyday" vs. vacay. Like one of the models above, you could use a longline two-piece top as a crop top beneath your favorite overalls. Or, like the second model, let a mesh bikini peek out just behind the straps of your regular tank. Want to amp it up a little? Wear a high-waisted mesh bottom under a pair of low-slung pants to add extra edge.  The models are going ham with these getups, but you don't have to push the boundaries quite so much. Start simple by trading your go-to bodysuit for a bright or striped one-piece swimsuit, and pair it with your favorite denim. Or, slip into a chunky knit off-the-shoulder sweater, and let your bikini top peek out of it, like a bralette, with a short skirt. What to Buy for That Off-Duty-Model Look On Barbie: A-Line Light Wash Overalls, FREE PEOPLE (Available at Lulu’s), $128; Seattle Bikini Top, OOKIOH, $49; Helissa Bagatelle Embroidery Shoe, LAURENCE DACADE, $800, not available for purchase; Babe Gold Choker, 21HM, $25; Gold Earrings, LARUICCI, $100. On Diandra: Black Knit Cropped Top, VERSUS VERSACE, $275, not available for purchase; Mix Match Logo Sweatpants, VERSUS VERSACE, $625, not available for purchase; Logo Knitted Scarf, VERSUS VERSACE, $350, not available for purchase; Safety Fishnet White Bikini Top, TOBI, $36;  Safety Fishnet White Bikini Bottom, TOBI, $34; Caro Shoes, PAUL ANDREW (Available at Farfetch), $795; Gold Link Earrings With Green Crystal, LARUICCI, $125   Go all-in on your flowy vacation style by incorporating statement swimwear into the look.  You may have seen surf-style rashguard swimsuits out and about, and they make excellent bodysuits to pair with crisp white shorts while on vacation. See how this model illustrates this point? Bet you couldn't even tell that was a swimsuit in the first place. Also, FYI, long-sleeve suits aren't only available in one-pieces. Check out the model in blue below — her little cropped cardigan is actually a bikini top that doubles as a sweet little "sweater" to wear with breezy palazzo pants or culottes. Not sure a long-sleeve swimsuit is really your style? That's fine! These looks work just as well with more traditional strappy, Bardot, or bandeau styles. Just remember to think about proportions. If you're trying a wide-leg pant, for example, opt for a smaller top to keep things balanced. Same rule applies to shorts and skirts — if you're going mini on the bottom, consider longer sleeves or a layering piece on top.

			 This is one wild look. I guarantee you Kim Kardashian's weekend was a bit more naked and Cher-focused than yours. Why? Because she attended the iconic singer's concert in Las Vegas on Friday and then walked around town wearing a super see-through outfit inspired by Cher on Saturday. The getup was a totally sheer, white duster with equally transparent, wide-leg pants paired with a butterfly halter. If it looks familiar, it's because Cher wore something just like it to the Grammys in 1974. Let's ~TuRn BaCk TiMe~ and see the iconic singer slaying her version of the lewk: And, once again, here's Kim's ensemble. Yeah, there are slight differences, like, Cher's butterfly had lavender and seafoam embellishments, and, instead of a robe, she wore a chiffon-like shawl. But, for the most part, this is pretty spot on. Props to Kim and her styling team. Now for the real question: Do we all start embracing sheer pants now? Turns out, there are actually a lot of them out there you can shop. To buy, or not to buy?!

			 But what will it be?! Meghan Markle's engagement ring already has diamonds from Princess Diana's personal jewelry collection, but with the future royal's wedding quickly approaching (it's on May 19, folks!), she reportedly will wear something else of Lady Di's for the big day. According to royal expert Katie Nicholl, Markle’s “something borrowed” could be another piece of the late princess' jewelry.  “Harry made sure Diana wasn’t forgotten on the day of his engagement,” she said in an interview with Express. “Two of the diamonds in Meghan’s ring are from Diana’s personal collection. So I think there’s every possibility that Meghan might wear a piece from Diana’s jewelry collection on her wedding day.”   Although the Spencer Tiara is one of the most well-known pieces from the princess' collection, jewelry writer Ella Kay told Town & Country it's "unlikely" that Markle will wear it. "I think it's unlikely, because Meghan is marrying into the Windsor family, not the Spencer family, so if she borrows a tiara, I think it will reflect her new royal status,” Kay said.    Another tiara the late princess was fond of was the Cambridge Lover's Knot tiara. Kate Middleton has worn it on formal occasions, although she opted for the Cartier Halo tiara from Queen Elizabeth's collection for her wedding. That piece, however, is also out of the running for what Markle might wear. However, Princess Diana had quite an extensive jewelry collection, so if Markle does, in fact, borrow a piece for the big day, it's safe to say she'll have no shortage of sparkly options.

			 Too hot to handle. Celebs like Cardi B, Taylor Swift, and Kiernan Shipka did not come to play with their super skin-baring outfits on the 2019 Billboard Awards red carpet.

			 Good to eat, but even better to wear.  Summer, and its much-needed warmer weather, is almost here. But before you break out all your floral clothes — it's impossible NOT to spot someone wearing the pattern on a hot day — consider a cherry print as a way to freshen up the season's wardrobe. I know it's a fruit pattern, but I promise you won't end up looking like a walking picnic.    The cheerful, '90s-inspired design first started popping up back in February – it was featured on a lingerie set of J. Crew's newest intimates collection – and one month later, cool-girl brand HVN partnered with Champion for a collection that included a full-on cherry look, including a sweater, shorts, and bucket hat.  SHOP NOW Cherry Hoodie Sweatshirt, CHAMPION X HVN (Available at Urban Outfitters), $80 But now cherries are literally everywhere, expanding into shoes, jewelry, bags, and even tech and home accessories. Keep scrolling for all the different ways to shop the trend.  If you want to add a fun print to an all-white summer outfit, consider these shoes. The sneakers are great for giving off retro vibes while running errands, and the cherries on the loafers and sandals take a casual shirt and denim ensemble to a whole new level. For a subtle look, there's a bunch of dainty, gold jewelry you can add to your collection. You can layer the pieces with other jewelry or wear them on their own so that the cherries stand out more. Whether you want a beachy straw envelope clutch or a more '90s-era transparent tote, there's so many ways to accessorize with the fruit that will work with your unique style. Not a fan of wearing it? Fine. But how about an adorable cherry-shaped light that will instantly make any wall the focal point of your apartment? And if that lighting isn't for you, there are also mats, pillows and iPhone cases that can incorporate the print into your home. If you can't get enough of the pattern, the good news is that it's available in pretty much every form of clothing: shorts, dresses, bathing suits, rompers, t-shirts, tanks – you name it. I'm deeming this summer the season that cherries replaced florals as the most popular pattern – and now, I'm really craving a bowl of them. Happy shopping, everyone! 🍒 Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Buh-bye, flip-flops. Summer may be over, but come on—it’s still sandal weather for at least a few more weeks. That means there’s still time to wax poetic about the footwear that’s gotten me through two sticky and sweaty summers, countless trips to the beach, dozens of disgusting subway rides, and casual days at the office where real shoes simply won’t do.  I’m talking, of course, about the rubber Birkenstocks you’ve probably seen everywhere that have made you wonder: Are they really worth it? And are those 1,800 five-star reviews actually legit? Uh, yes. Yes, they are. Allow me to explain: You know how people are so obsessed with the classic Birkenstocks? The ones that look just like these but have leather straps and suede footbeds and are adored by Phish heads and IG influencers alike? Yeah, these have the same level of walkable comfort (I’ve had 18,000-step days with these bad boys yet zero blisters). But they’re rubber, so they’re also waterproof, which is ideal for wading in gross lakes, walking along rocky beaches, and side-stepping city puddles. Plus, with this version, there’s no breaking-in period required. Just throw ’em on and run out the door. I recently went on a weekend trip with eight friends, and half of us had these on hand. The two dudes who brought them had pairs in dark colors like navy or green, and the other woman wore a shiny metallic set. And, truth, they looked good on everyone in every single setting. They were an obvious choice to wear with my bathing suit and cover-up, but they were also casual and cool with one male friend’s button-down and shorts. Sure, we were basically a Birken-cult while walking to dinner, but who could care when our feet were so happy?    Forgot to post this #ootd from Friday! I am 94% sure I had this exact outfit in college too 🤔 A post shared by  Eva Chen (@evachen212) on Jun 11, 2019 at 1:56am PDT  Before I introduced rubber Birks into my life, I would purchase cheap, crappy flip-flops every year, hoping they would take me through those warm months and into the fall. But by the Fourth of July, they were ready to combust, had chafed my feet, and were on the verge of breaking thanks to shoddy foam and flimsy plastic. Reluctantly, I’d buy another pair, spending anywhere from $30 to $50 on stupid shoes I only wore to the beach or in the shower at the gym. For just about that amount of money, I can buy these dreamy shoes and be set for years. YEARS! But they’re also cheap enough that I could buy a few more pairs if I really wanted to and still not break the bank. In fact, BRB, running to grab another color....

			 Your neck will look SO good in these pieces.   In case you didn’t know (or *gasp* you’ve deleted your Instagram), layering gold necklaces has really become a huge accessory trend in recent years. You can mix lengths and wear a choker, pendant, and thick chain all at once to add some subtle bling to any look.  Celebrities like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski,  Karlie Kloss, Sophie Turner, and Margot Robbie are just some A-listers known to really pile on their jewelry. Another thing they have in common? They’ve all been spotted wearing the brand Missoma London, a UK-based label known for its gorge gold-plated designs and influencer collaborations (its most recent drop was in partnership with blogger Lucy Williams).  On September 29, Bella was spotted wearing a chain necklace from the collab while in Paris for Fashion Week. (It ALMOST distracted from her *ahem* very see-through shirt.)  Her sister wore the Axiom chain for, like, four months straight, including at an appearance at the Savage X Fenty fashion show, also in September.  And Dua Lipa wore the brand’s necklaces—the Aegis chain and Lena choker—while attending the Burberry show with boyfriend Anwar Hadid.    While it’s not the least expensive jewelry, its styles are 18-carat gold and will last you a looong time if you’re the type of person to make a little bit of an investment in your accessories. Many of the more minimal chain designs are timeless and go with everything, so like Gigi, you can wear ’em every day for months on end.  But if you don’t want to drop serious dough, there are tons of other necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets, and even anklets you can find under $100 from the brand—and not just in gold! So now you know the latest celeb- and influencer-loved jewelry label—and you can own the same pieces if you’ve been ogling them. (I know I have.)

			 Season's greetings! Where to begin? I guess here: Online retailer Boohoo is selling Christmas wreaths for your nipples. They pretty much look how you imagine they'd look, but if you're curious...   There they are! If you saw these and thought, I NEED to have 'em! I'm so sorry to inform you that they are already out of stock. But, you know what? You're not completely out of luck, because apparently there's a whole festive pasty industry and you can buy similar items (including something that looks exactly like the ones above) on Amazon. Here's a fun selection of the variety: Joy to the world! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Yeahhhh, it’s pretty incriminating. Oh boy, here we go again! Your favorite fast-fashion brand, Fashion Nova (babyyyy!), has been pulled into drama yet again for ripping off designs without a single care in the world. This time, the brand is coming under fire for ripping off luxury Italian fashion house, the one, the only—Versace. On Monday, Versace filed a lawsuit against Fashion Nova for copying their signature Barocco print and perhaps their most iconic print known to mankind. Ring a bell? Yep, it’s the “jungle print” dress that Jennifer Lopez wore to the 2000 Grammy Awards that single-handedly inspired the creation of Google Images—yes, really.  Everyone adored that dress, so much so that Versace actually brought it back during its Spring 2020 show during Milan Fashion Week...with J.Lo modeling it!!!  But I digress. The Fashion Law managed to obtain a copy of the lawsuit docs, in which Versace claims that Fashion Nova is trying to “exploit the popularity and renown of Versace’s signature designs, and to trade on [its] valuable goodwill and business reputation in order to drive profits and sales to line Fashion Nova’s pockets.” Say it with me: Yikes! “Fashion Nova’s ability to churn out new clothing so quickly…is due in large part to its willingness to copy the copyrighted designs, trademarks, and trade dress elements of well-known designers, and trade on their creative efforts in order to bolster [its own] bottom line,” the papers continued. Basically, it’s as messy as you probably expected.  In case you’re wondering, here’s the ripoff dress that Fashion Nova is selling on their website for $69.99 before shipping: This isn’t the first time that Fashion Nova has come under fire for copying designs. Earlier this year, Kim Kardashian wore a vintage Thierry Mugler cutout gown to the 5th Annual Hollywood Beauty Awards—and Fashion Nova sold a replica of it on their website for $50, literally 24 hours later. “It’s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat, and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas,” Kim wrote on Twitter after the event. “I’ve watched these companies profit off my husband’s work for years and now that it’s also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent.” It’s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas. It’s unclear how much $ Versace is suing Fashion Nova for at the moment, but IDK...something tells me this won’t end well for one of these brands!

			 They're pretty AND comfy! Now that summer is in full swing, the heat is about to turn TF up—and it won't take much to become a total sweat fest. To help keep you cool, workout shorts are the perfect option for when you don't want to feel like you're sweltering.  The best news is that Nordstrom is having a sale on some of the best women's shorts for up to 40 percent off! From PUMA to Champion, you can score one of these lightweight, breathable gym shorts for under $30. But hurry—because sizes are selling out fast! Perfect for yoga, these fitted shorts will help you flow from one pose to the next with control and ease. The elastic waist isn't restrictive at all and hugs your curves comfortably. A Nordstrom reviewer says, "The material was nice and thick and comfortable. The length was great—not too short or too long." Whether you're doing HIIT or hot yoga, these terry-knit shorts have ventilated mesh panels on the sides to prevent you from overheating. The best part is they come with side pockets, where you can store your keys and a small wallet. Plus, the drawstring waistband allows you to adjust it to your level of comfort. Nordstrom reviewers say these shorts run large so be sure to order a size down.  Beyoncé's activewear line, Ivy Park, gives your workout gear a stylish edge without trying too hard, and these baseball-inspired shorts are anything but basic. These drawstring shorts are best for wearing post-workout if you want to stay cool and casual. The bright melon color instantly makes your entire outfit pop, even if you decide to wear a black or white tee.  You'll feel like you're running through air once you slip on these comfy terry knit shorts. The drawstring waist makes them easy to adjust and ensure they don't fall down, whether you're doing burpees or jump squats. They have mesh side panels and side pockets to stuff small essentials. And with a flirty, colorful print, you'll feel motivated to hit pavement.  With a stretchy waistband and a wide cut, you can run, walk, hop, jump, skip in these workout shorts with comfort. They're made with 100 percent cotton, so they're lightweight, soft, and cooling to the touch.

			 Ooh, so pretty!   Any time is a great time to get a gift for the woman in your life! It doesn’t *have* to be her birthday or a special occasion, FYI. But whether you’re her coworker, S.O., or BFF, sometimes you draw a blank when you’re trying to think about what gift she’d like. So here’s where this list comes in! We’ve compiled a bunch of cute presents, from clothing to tech accessories, that she’ll be pumped to receive—trust me. Here, 40 gift ideas for women that’ll definitely surprise her in the best way possible. As temperatures slowly begin to drop with fall approaching, she will definitely appreciate a warm jacket in a soft faux-shearling material. Chain necklaces are all the rage this fall, so she’ll definitely feel on trend walking around in this pretty gift. No more dead phone, TG. This marble-patterned charging hub with gold accents will simplify her life while adding a touch of design to her countertop. If she doesn’t already have AirPods, she definitely needs a pair. These wireless earbuds connect automatically and offer more than 24 hours listening time. Beauty sleep never looked so good. She’ll love this silk bedtime accessory with an artsy Van Gogh print. A hair set with shampoo, conditioner, shine cream, dry shampoo, and texture spray will be her most prized products, especially with the cute packaging.  Time to say yee-effing-haw and get her these stylish boots that lean way into the Western trend you’re seeing everywhere. Her eyelids will look killer with any of these metallic shades of nude pink, rose gold, and shimmery copper. There’s nothing like wearing a pair of soft, cozy socks when it starts to get cold out. She’ll want to wear these fun ones around the house and with cute fall outfits to show ’em off. Hair dents are SO annoying, but thankfully, she can avoid them with gentle silk hair ties that are strong enough to hold any ponytail without damaging her strands. Her apartment is her sanctuary, so get her a faux-fur pillow that makes her bed or couch instantly more homey. This one comes in tons of colors that will match any decor. Who doesn’t like a touch of glamour? A metallic purse with a gold tassel is a special gift that’ll take her outfit from fun to fabulous—especially when the holidays roll around. A simple gold necklace is the perfect choice if she’s known for layering necklaces. If she’s all about skincare and new beauty gadgets, a DIY dermaplaning tool will easily be incorporated into her nighttime routine. Yes, it’s a splurge, but she deserves it! A lil neon sign she can easily install on any wall will make her room super chic (and Instagrammable). A Polaroid camera is useful to document your friendship with. She can take it on trips, and it’s easy to travel with thanks to its smaller size and handy wrist strap. Duffle bags don't just have to be for traveling you know! This mini one can be worn as a shoulder bag or a crossbody, and the unique shape will get you so many compliments.  More dresses should be made with sleeves, and this is my swan song. But at least this pretty one already has ’em and is perfect for work or date night! If you wanna lean into that chain theme a bit, get her a matching ring. Anyone would appreciate getting such a fun, stylish dress! This one’s off-the-shoulder neckline, puff sleeves, and funky floral pattern make it a head turner that will get her all the compliments. Listen, either you’re into crystals or you aren’t, but there’s no denying these are pretty, whether she uses them as decor or for their special powers. Okay, have you ever seen a cuter candle jar? I wouldn’t believe you if you said yes. Buy her this now. If she’s more of a casual kicks type of gal, these navy-blue-and-pink ones by Veja will be right at the top of her wish list. A pair of trendy Le Specs sunglasses is sure to be a hit. These bold frames accentuate the retro allure of full-coverage sunnies without feeling heavy. This cute-ass mat features a colorful torso design that’s the perfect addition to any bathroom. Plus, its no-slip latex backing makes it a smart choice for post-shower safety. Bedhead, be gone! A long-fiber, mulberry silk pillowcase promises a gentle sleeping surface for her skin and hair. Looks like self-care Sunday is about to get even better. She’ll love wrapping herself in a soft robe while lighting a scented candle for a feeling of absolute serenity. She’ll thank you for introducing her to this canned wine. It’s a great grab-and-go product for her next picnic or the perfect single serving so she doesn’t have to open a full bottle! If she’s the journaling type, this customizable vegan leather journal is a special place for her to jot down anything that comes to mind—and it fits right in her purse. If she’s known to sport a different nail color every week, get her a pretty polish set that has a range of neutral shades suited for all occasions. If she’s the kind of woman who loves herself some lipstick (or lipgloss!), she’ll enjoy keeping her collection from scattering all over her bathroom drawers with this 24-compartment tray. This timeless oval-shaped ring is super chic but also supports a great cause. For every $100 spent at Bonito, the company donates a backpack filled with supplies to a child in need. A face roller made of real rose quartz can help de-puff, boost circulation, and improve elasticity. The next best thing to tasting a delectable macaron is smelling one. This five-piece candle set features delicious scents of the famed French cookie in adorable cases shaped to look like one too. If her phone is like an appendage, it better have good skin. This patterned iPhone 8 or X cover features gorgeous beach imagery, bringing some sunshine to her everyday tech accessory. For the beauty lover who has all sorts of masks, she’ll definitely want to try this plant-based option for her most intimate area that’s designed to bring some extra pampering into her self-care routine. Users say this is great for after shaving to avoid razor burn and ingrown hairs. Her locks will feel instantly refreshed with light perfume spray that also happens to cut down on static. If you need proof of how good this smells, Côte d’Azur is such a popular fragrance that the brand even made it into its own perfume. Shopping for a yogi? She’ll definitely like this 5-mm mat suitable for all yoga activities. Bonus points for the fact that it’s made from repurposed wetsuits. With the array of vivid shades this Nars palette offers, you can’t go wrong. From pink cherry to deep blackberry, she’ll for sure like one (if not all of them!). The best kind of day is a good hair day. That’s why a quiet hair dryer with ultra-fast drying technology would be a great gift.

This one can fit a 15-inch laptop and even has a sleeve on the back that slides over your luggage handle.   Made of soft leather, Rebecca Minkoff bags only get better with age. This metallic shade is gorge, and the three zipper compartments mean that you'll never lose anything in the depths of your bag again.  The brand has tons of chic, grown-up-looking options at an affordable price point. Case in point? This cute style is made of faux-leather. Wear with the straps or carry it by the gold handle depending on your mood.   For every bag purchased, the brand supports an American child in need. And it doesn't hurt that its bags have just the right amount of style and sportiness. Wear this contrast one out to brunch or load it with your laptop before heading to work. Sure, you might know this brand more for its nylon totes, but it makes backpacks that are just as chic featuring a textured leather flap. The water-resistant material keeps your belongings protected, but it also folds flat when stored away.  Not looking to drop a ton of money? This brand has a variety of inexpensive options that don't skimp out on style, like this trendy transparent mini backpack with adjustable straps.  The neoprene material on Dagne Dover bags is definitely what makes them stand out. It looks ultra-sleek and also gives an added cushion for those fragile items like your laptop and other electronics.  Madewell has great basics with a vintage flair, like this all-leather black one that has lots of interior pockets for organizing. Pair it with your favorite floral dress and worn-in sneakers to make it a cute summer outfit.  What's great about this Herschel Supply Co. backpack is that it's made of crinkled cotton, so it doesn't feel stiff or rough against your skin; plus, the white hue will go with any look this season.   You've prob seen this Scandinavian bag brand EVERYWHERE, but there's a reason why. The water-resistant material is amazingly durable and holds up with everyday wear, and its utilitarian features include a top handle, a removable foam insert, and a compact shape.  Amazon's fashion can be super on point, so don't count out this site if you want a stylish bag. This backpack is not only functional with all its pockets and convertible straps, but it also has a fun tassel detail and comes in six other shades.  If you're a minimalist, you'll love Everlane's bags. This sleek nylon backpack is great for traveling. It folds right into its front pocket, so you can pack it easily into your luggage.     Target can do no wrong when it comes to quality (and cute!) pieces at very reasonable prices. Its brand, A New Day, delivers on bags with classic silhouettes. This mini one comes in a cool cobalt blue and you can also wear it as a crossbody bag.   Known for its Italian leather, look into Cuyana if you want to go all out on a luxe bag. This modern backpack has an easy-access front pocket that conveniently stores your phone as well as two strap options—one to carry as a shoulder bag and the other as a backpack.   This brand's bags are unlined and made of woven fabric, making them the lightest thing you'll ever carry; plus, the bold blue color will brighten up even your most simple outfit.   Eastpak's aesthetic ranges from classic canvas bags to on-trend styles like this transparent number.  And this one's size is perfect: Small enough that it won't awkwardly slide off your shoulder, but big enough that you can still fit everything you need.  Kipling's crinkled nylon fabric is light but definitely holds up, while the interior opening allows easy access to quickly throw in all your sh*t. Also, doesn't that signature money keychain give you so much nostalgia?  JanSport, aka the backpack brand that needs no introduction, is a classic go-to. It has a wide range of styles, solid colors, and patterns so you can find the perfect one that fits your unique personal style.

			 Vacation clothes > all other clothes. Why just go for a basic cover-up when you could have a whole eye-catching tropical aesthetic? If you're planning to show TF up for your next day at the beach, scroll on for some cute outfit inspo. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Wrap dresses are awesome, because you can wear them as intended, orrrr you can wear them as jacket-slash-robe hybrids that work great as cover-ups. How cute is this one's striped color combo? Wide-leg culottes are breezier than fitted options, which make them perfect for warm beach climates. This lavender jumpsuit is so cute paired with a straw bucket bag and flatform espadrilles. Looking for a cover-up that doesn't really cover anything up? Found it! This dress plus that circle bag = major beach mood. The best thing about two-piece sets on vacation: three outfits in one. Wear just the shirt, just the skirt, or both together. All iterations look fab with a pair of naked sandals and wire-frame shades, don't you think? Gotta love the easy on, easy off aspect of this bow-tie slip dress. Wear your suit beneath it and you're ready to go straight from brunch into the ocean. The statement bag and orange shoes = the cherry on top. Go retro with a pair of pedal pusher pants straight outta the '50s, a printed halter top, and a wide-brimmed hat.  The lighter fabric in this two-piece set will keep you cool (but still covered!) and a Panama hat is the perfect finishing touch. What's it called when you fool everyone into thinking you looked polished and put together but really you're wearing the most comfortable knit pants? Genius, that's what. These loungers are basically pajama soft, but they look perfect poolside with a knotted Oxford shirt, don'tcha think? If sweet and cute is your vibe, go for a floral wrap dress with a saucy plunge and pair with coordinating sandals and a small bag. Statement tassel earrings will pull the whole thing together and really make it sing. Vacation is all about the swimsuits, so go bright or go home. Add a netted sarong to step up your outfit, but not take away from the main event. Anyone else have zero energy after an awesome day enjoying the water and the sun? Throw this multi-print off-the-shoulder dress and a pair of bright block heels and you'll get all the compliments, even though you didn't put that much into your lewk. If showing off that bikini top is the goal, but you still want to look somewhat covered, consider a crochet tank tucked into a pair of tie-dye pants. A bucket hat and flatforms match this mood completely. What could be simpler than throwing a triped T-shirt dress over your bikini, adding a beach hat, and throwing a towel in this dramatic tote? Nothing. Yes to this print, yes to coordinating sets, yes to this straw shopper, and yes to these lace-up heels. Any questions? Crochet is a major trend this summer, in case you couldn't already tell. Get in on the action with a pair of neutral knit pants and a tie-front top that'll show off your suit underneath in a subtle, yet sexy way. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Nothing wrong with a traditional cover-up look, especially if it has a cute scoop-back detail and a tassel trim. Wear it with flat gladiator sandals, and you're on your way to compliment city. A flowy maxi with a deep plunge is already flirty, but add a pop of red in the form of a halter bikini and you take it from 0 to 60 real fast.  World, meet the perfect, breezy maxi for any summer occasion! Just add your fave slides and you're all set.  Wide-leg pants, a button-down tank, and gladiator sandals are obviously a summer beach night vibe. Pair with a wicker bag for optimal summer style. If the typical flowy, wide-leg pants aren't your thing, go for a cigarette-cut capri with tasseled hems and pair with a high-neck crop top and coordinating bag.  Ever noticed that robes are literally just wrap dresses disguised as loungewear? This one is perfect for vacation, as it functions as your getting-ready robe, a cover-up, a sexy plunging dress, or a layering jacket depending on how you tie it and style it. Nothing's comfier than crocheted knits at the beach. Super soft, a little thicker and warmer than traditional linens but still breezy—the perfect combination! Pair this one with black sandals and you're good to go. If you like jumpsuits but aren't as into sleeves, you may want to try out a soft pair of overalls, which look really good with bandeau-type bikini tops! This cover-up actually looks great dressed up for dinner. Add a structural bag and a pair of neutral heels, and no one will ever know you wore it with your one-piece earlier. Looking for something sweet? Consider a rust-colored midi dress with buttons down the middle and delicate frilled sleeve details. It looks so good with a wicker circle bag and minimalist sandals. If you're trying to just throw something on and go, think about a knee-length swing dress with mixed prints for added interest. A coordinating straw hat will pull the look together. If you're planning on doing something a bit more fancy at the beach, it might be a good time to consider a strapless top and coordinating skirt. The tie detail here also makes the skirt asymmetrical, if you're into that! How pretty is this striped duster with a pair of light-wash jean shorts and a simple white bikini top? Add a straw bag and wrap-around flat sandals, and you're in for a great day of water action. Tube dresses = easy to slip on and off, which means they're perfect for your day at the beach, the bar, and galavanting around whatever tropical destination you have in store.  A cover-up that's also a cute day dress? Yes, please! Neutral slides lend extra polish to this pretty pink number.

			 No more slipping, tyvm.  Strapless bras can pose a lot of problems. First thing? They go against the very nature of gravity without straps to hold your boobs up! Second thing? I'm 100 percent sure you've been in a situation where you're in a bathroom stall reaching down into your shirt yanking it up when it inevitably falls to, like, the middle of your torso. No one (including myself) enjoys doing this.  Luckily, there ARE some real gems out there on the internet that not only stay up, but are actually downright comfortable. Really! Whether you like versatile styles (the option of removable straps is never a bad thing!), push-ups, or bandeaus, here are the 11 best strapless bras for every preference.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag?

			 This theme’s a doozy, guys.  Alright, people, let’s get to the point: The 2020 Met Gala—aka the very fun, fashionable party put on by the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art every year—has a theme.  You may recall that last year, the theme was Camp: Notes on Fashion, which gave us Lady Gaga’s iconic wardrobe changes on the red carpet. And the year before, it was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, which demonstrated that maybe Rihanna should just be our new pope. This year, we’re going a bit more abstract with About Time: Fashion and Duration. Want more details? Find out everything you need to know about this year’s Met Ball, below! According to Andrew Bolton, the Costume Institute’s curator, the theme, like I said, is About Time: Fashion and Duration. More from Andrew via the New York Times: “Fashion is indelibly connected to time. It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times.” Ah, yes.  And as that article also points out, there are a lot of other fashion-time issues that are top of mind right now, like: designers hoping for more time to be creative, consumers wishing they could buy a piece right off the runway instead of waiting for it, and, of course, the growing awareness of fashion’s impact on the environment and the importance of shopping secondhand, focusing on sustainability, and making what was old new again. Oh, and did I also mention it’s the Met’s 150th anniversary in 2020?  According to the NYT, the works of Virginia Woolf and early 20th century French philosopher Henri Bergson have heavily influenced the theme. Bolton is planning on combining objective time (calendar years) with subjective time (moments of creativity).  Honestly, maybe. But designers could take this theme wherever they want! Theoretically, attendees could wear something timeless and that would embody the theme, or they could do the opposite and lean hard into a specific year. The Met Gala is always the first Monday in May, which will fall on May 7, 2020. The show is chaired by Nicolas Ghesquière, the designer behind Louis Vuitton; Emma Stone; Meryl Streep, who starred in The Hours, a story inspired by Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway; Lin-Manuel Miranda; and, as always, Vogue’s Anna Wintour.

			 Channel the snow with these lewks.  Whoever said you can’t wear white after Labor Day has some serious issues. I mean, how does one write off an entire color after a specific holiday?! Thankfully, fashion never plays by the rules—and we don’t either. While warmer-weather trends are filled with color—think neons, tie-dye, and bold hues—you’ll def amp up your chic factor when you wear creams and whites this season. Ahead, 25 cute winter white outfits that’ll make you look effortless when you hit the slush-covered streets.  There’s nothing that makes you look more pulled-together than a slim-fitting turtleneck. Wear it with a denim skirt and neutral knee-high boots for an outfit you can wear both in and out of the office. Just because summer’s over doesn’t mean the tie-dye trend is. This multicolored white slip definitely looks cold-weather-appropriate when worn with an oversize teddy coat and cream combat boots. A shirtdress is a great basic to have in your closet. Yes, even in winter! Put a cream sweater or coat over it to fight off the chill, and add a transparent top-handle to finish off the look. You’ll feel like you’re wrapped in a blanket with this ultra-soft pullover. Pair it with a white midi skirt and neutral accessories for that effortless I-just-threw-this-on outfit. Get a coat and scarf in one with an oversize cape that does wonders for neck warmth. Don’t be afraid to wear it with white denim too! Add a simple belt and colorful cowboy boots for some contrast. A matching set makes getting ready in the morning incredibly easy when you’re short on time, and a knit midi with a coordinating cardigan looks polished. (Pro tip: Invest in a slip skirt if it’s too sheer for ya.) Transition between seasons with a classic white smock minidress that is stylish but oh-so comfortable. Pair it with block-heel sandals on warmer days and cowboy boots when the temp starts to drop. Cargo styles are all the rage this season, and not just as pants! So why not try a more elevated cargo skirt in satin? Coordinate with an equally satiny button-down and a polished crossbody bag. A white chunky knit is SO versatile. Dress it up with a patterned miniskirt, tweed bag, and beret, or go casual with jeans and flats. If you’re hesitant to wear white on white, try a simpler option. An all-white denim ensemble is très chic with minimal risk of getting it wrong. Nothing is more classic than an oversize white shirt—especially if it’s under $50. Wear it with jeans or a knit skirt and lots of layered gold necklaces for a sophisticated ensemble. Forget what you may think of cardigans! There’s a reason this little piece of outerwear has stood the test of time. It’s elegant and effortless, and it keeps you warm when the frigid winter air creeps into your office building. White leather bike shorts? You so didn’t know you needed these until now. Make them the statement by keeping the rest of your ’fit (i.e., a blazer, white tee, and black shoes) minimal. If you’ve been living in boiler suits, then this white corduroy one is a must for your winter shopping list. It’ll look killer with some bold high-heel ankle boots—trust me. Pair this mini with tall boots and tights to wear it into colder months. Throw on a ribbed white long-sleeve shirt and you’ve nailed the whole “winter white” thing. Everyone should own a timeless sweater dress. They’re comfy yet totally refined. Accessorize with lace-up booties and a gold-chain crossbody, and this asymmetrical one is a definite knockout. Trade out your blue denim jacket for a white one this season. You might be surprised how much it’ll refresh your basic, everyday attire—it’s just as versatile. A pair of white wide-leg jeans is a must if you’re into a minimal vibe. They also happen to look great with gold hoops and a beige top. This not-so-basic mini can easily transition from work to play, and the tiered frills set it apart from the rest of your LWDs (that’s Little White Dresses to you). A white sequin coordinating blazer and pant set is practically calling your name for all those upcoming holiday events. An understated flowing white trench goes with everything. Imagine how stylish you’ll look caught in a snow flurry. Wear it with white pants or on its own as a dress. A cropped jacket is a great transitional piece when the weather can’t make up its mind. Pair it with cropped pants and a cute lil top-handle for a fancy touch. A white sweater makes the perfect layering piece, but the added neon detail makes a statement even when worn alone. Tuck it into some high-waisted white jeans for a standout lewk. Be the chicest gal in town in an embroidered midi dress that strikes the perfect balance of elegant and sexy (thanks to the thigh-high slit). Throw on some leather over-the-knee boots when colder weather hits. Travel in style or lounge luxuriously in this coordinating cable-knit lewk. Because once it’s below freezing, you’ll totally want a comfy high-waisted two-piece set.

			 So, so pretty. H&M announced Thursday that, come spring, it would launch a line of modest clothing called H&M LTD Collection. The photos of the capsule are here, and boy are they stunning: H&M LTD Collection includes kaftans, tunic-style blouses, wide-leg pants, coordinating separates, flowy maxis, and midis in seasonally appropriate colors and fabrics (think: lightweight yellows, blues, and whites). The line will only be available online in the U.S., and will officially launch on two different dates, May 3 (aka tomorrow) and May 24.

"There's a confidence and positive feeling throughout the entire collection, from the flowing silhouettes to the head-to-toe prints, that women all over the world will really relate to." Here are a few pieces to get excited about: Happy shopping! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Honestly, I feel betrayed. I thought I knew who my real friends were until I faced a vexing fashion crisis late last week. I was getting dressed at the gym when I realized I was missing the back to one of the big, chunky earrings I wanted to wear as an accessory to my already #Extra outfit. Panicked, I dumped the contents of my bag in the hopes I would find a spare back. (I didn’t.) I prayed I could balance a two-pound earring in my lobe the entire day. (I couldn’t.) So I decided to do what any normal person with an ounce of confidence would do for the sake of #Fashun: I removed the backless earring and carried on pretending I had planned to rock a single one all along.   How to Wear Pajamas (and Bed Head!) to Work Without Getting Fired (Yet) A post shared by  Mia Lardiere (@mialardiere) on Feb 20, 2019 at 3:21pm PST  Earrings That Seriously Have Your Back This act came to a screeching halt 15 minutes into my day when a cashier at my company cafeteria complimented me on my big, chunky, solitary piece of jewelry. I replied, practically in one breath, “Thanks so much, they’re from H&M, and I say ‘they’re’ because there are two earrings to the set but I lost the back of the second so I’m only wearing one. Cute, right?” “Oh, honey,” she said. “Hasn’t anyone ever told you about the eraser trick?”  They hadn’t. I, on the other hand, am a good person. I posted my cafeteria friend’s hack on Instagram Stories to spread the wealth and will continue to pay it forward by sharing it here. Behold: The Ultimate Hack for a Missing Earring Back  Posting this here for no other reason than I'll need it later for something. Pls carry on with your Friday night and remember to hydrate A post shared by  Mia Lardiere (@mialardiere) on Feb 22, 2019 at 5:10pm PST Her trick couldn’t be easier: All you do is cut the eraser from an unused pencil and pierce the pole of the earring through its center. That’s literally it. And it works! I wore mine for about 12 hours without any problems. About two-thirds of the people who replied to my Story were just as mind-blown as I was. How about *you*? How are you feeling RN? Never Let Your Ears Be a Hot Mess Again Stock up on erasers.  Snip away.   Keep extra earring backs on you! Hold your sh*t.

			 Twitter had a lot of thoughts about Tom Brady's jacket. The dresses and the crazy headpieces are thrilling, yes, but when you're following along at home, one of the best parts of the Met Gala is the tweets. Recall the Rihanna pizza dress memes of 2015, or the Kim Kardashian grandma's couch debacle of 2013. It's one of the only times Twitter is fun and not terrifying! In the spirit of laughing with a bunch of famous people who got dressed up just to go to the museum, here's a roundup of the best tweets about the 2018 Met Gala.  1.

			 All the colors!!!  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Lauren Conrad (i.e., Laguna Beach-slash-The Hills reality-star-turned-businesswoman-and-designer) has released her new spring line with Kohl’s, and it’s filled with supercute  printed dresses, tassel earrings, jewelry trays, geometric vases, and more.  “The color palette is a lot brighter than we normally go,” Lauren said, “but it was a nice way to update the collection.” The mom (who’s expecting baby number two!) wore a denim jacket and paired it with a sunny striped dress at the event launch last week, which seemed like an embodiment of her spring line’s aesthetic: classic denim pieces and chambray mixed with bold hues and fun patterns.    Come October, Lauren will be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of her partnership with the retailer. “I’m really proud of the brand as it stands today,” she said. “I feel like you are able to walk into a Kohl’s store, pick up one of our pieces, and know that it’s ours without looking at the label.” Another thing she’s proud of? The fact that she’s had extended sizing, ranging from 0X to 3X, since September 2017. “This line has always been really accessible from a price point, but I wanted it to be available to everybody who wanted to shop it.” She’s also stepping into a new category, releasing a line of sleepwear in June this year. “As a mom, pajamas are a part of my wardrobe. I wear them often, so I liked the idea of including sleep in the collection.” If you’re feeling inspired by LC’s spring vibes, shop the items below for yourself!

			 So small! So cute!   If you want a tattoo, but you're looking for something subtle, use these celeb tiny tats as inspiration.  Bella Hadid's itty bitty rose design—which she had inked in 2017—made an appearance at the Oscar de la Renta runway show in February 2019.  You could see Sarah Hyland's arrow tattoo in the middle of her back as she attended the Vanity Fair Oscars after party in 2018.  Lady Gaga tatted her arm with the music notes "G-A-G-A" in February 2019. She had to get another line added after a fan pointed out that musical staffs have five lines—not four.  Model Kaia Gerber went to celeb tattoo artist JonBoy to get this Picasso-inspired design on her arm.  In 2015, Kylie Jenner received this red tat that's the phonetic pronunciation of "sanity."  Halsey has a few hand tattoos, including this number 7 on her pointer finger. Brooklyn Beckham has the birth years of each of his three siblings tattooed to the back of his arm.  Sarah Hyland visited Dr. Woo to turn her favorite quote by Robert Frost, "The best way out is always through," into art.  Besties Jordyn Woods and Kylie Jenner got matching red lines, which Kylie hinted on Snap was actually the letter "M," tattooed on their fingers.  The cast of Pretty Little Liars paid a visit to Shamrock Social Club to commemorate the show with tiny finger tattoos. Bella Hadid has a tiny angel wing on the inside of her right food. Gymnast and four-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles has the Olympic rings tattooed to her forearm.  One of Cara Delevingne's many tattoos, this pair of eyes on the nape of her neck are so realistic. Kendall Jenner told Ellen about the time she drunkenly got a lip tattoo that says "Meow." Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott got matching ankle tattoos of a butterfly. Later the butterfly would become a prominent theme in their daughter Stormi's nursery.  According to an interview with Elle UK, Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams got matching tattoos with the date "07/08/09," the day they both were told they were cast in Game of Thrones.

It seriously makes mixing and matching your perfect bikini SO easy. This company’s ’80s-inspired swimwear is made using repurposed fishing nets, so you can look trendy while keeping your carbon footprint in check. The direct-to-consumer brand has gained popularity with its swimwear thanks to its “try before you buy” option, in which you can test out the swimwear in your own home and simply send back what you don’t want to keep. The Brazil-based brand is all about fun prints, like polka dots and tie-dye, seen here in a super cute white-and-yellow colorway. The retailer’s newest swim brand offers sizes from XS-XL, with select styles in 14W-26W, such as this top-rated black set with ruching. You’ve prob (unknowingly) seen these suits all over your feed. Sidway Swim’s brown-and-white polka-dot suit was majorly trending last summer, and if you’re into simple designs, def check the brand out. Victoria’s Secret model Candice Swanepoel founded Tropic of C in 2018, and the silhouettes feature tiny string bikinis with even tinier bottoms (seen here), sophisticated one-pieces, and edgier belted numbers. Designers Lauren Arapage and Joshua Shaub built this swim brand using a single image of supermodel Kate Moss from the ’90s as the inspiration. The one-pieces and bikinis feature cute floral designs that are practically made for summer. This swimwear—all made in Los Angeles—will be your go-to for bustier tops and high-cut bottoms that put a modern twist on Old Hollywood glamour. Think of OYE when you want to wear something bold. Its unique silhouettes will ensure you stand out on your next vacation.

			 Take your footwear game to a whole new level. Step into these cute trendy shoes this fall! A twist on a classic block heel, these shoes are created with a cool slant and have been seen all over the runway this season.  These tanned leather knee-high boots are from A Détacher. Adeam showcased the trend with suede over-the-knee boots that had a slightly shorter heel. The slanted heel on these dark blue Tibi shoes gives the classic patent leather boot a refresh.  Whether they are tied around ankles or around the shoe itself, a bow detail is definitely a trend for fall.  3.1 Phillip Lim paired a thick rubber-soled black flat with  a romantic ribbon tied in a bow.  These white slingbacks at Prabal Gurung had a black bow loosely tied around the front, and they also featured an asymmetrical wooden heel.  Ulla Johnson showed these ballerina-pink velvet heels with a bow tied in the back. The shoe was paired with coordinating socks.  All-red outfits were a trend on their own, so naturally that carried down to footwear on the runway.  These ankle strap heels from Calvin Luo were even paired with matching fishnet tights.  These velvet heels walked down the runway at Oscar de la Renta with an equally vibrant tulle dress.  At Dennis Basso, these bright red leather ankle boots were paired with dark plaid pants.  The utilitarian style will definitely your feet warm during fall and winter 2018.   The trend appeared on the runway at Chromat with neon yellow laces.  A pair of combat boots were sent down the runway at John Elliot with cute navy socks.  At Jonathan Simkhai, a black crocodile-patterned version of the design was shown.  Come fall, start paying particular attention to the shape of your heels — cylindrical blocks.  At Creatures of Comfort, these navy-and-white polka dot shoes with a circular wooden heel were paired with a red dress.  Oscar de la Renta paired the round heel trend with slip-ons.  At Tibi, these purple pumps with a narrow cylinder heel strutted down the runway.  Plaid is always a popular fall print for pants, shirts, and dresses, but designers took it a step further this season by featuring the pattern on shoes.  This pair from Vivienne Tam has a red, black, and tan color scheme and looks even more on trend with contrasting plaid tights.  Black and white patterned booties strutted down the runway at the Self-Portrait show.  Bright tartan-patterned boots were shown at Michael Kors.  The '90s have returned with a vengeance, so you better get used to square toe shoes with a little kitten heel.  This solid white style appeared at the Bevza show.  Sies Marjan showed these red mules with a small squared toe. Tom Ford's runway show featured bold leopard-printed kitten heels in red, metallic, yellow, and green that matched the model's pants.  White sneakers were *the* shoe style last season, but now it's time to try out the same color with an ankle boot instead.  This pair at the Derek Lam show featured extra stitching on the side.  White hot patent leather boots with kitten heels walked down the runway at Tory Burch.  At Self-Portrait, these ankle boots with a wrap-around effect were shown.  Just because it's fall doesn't mean you should shy away from bold colors — bright pink is about to be majorly in season for FW '18.  These strappy shoes at the Cushnie et Ochs runway show definitely made a statement.  Oscar de la Renta followed suit with these bright three-strap heels.  At the Christian Siriano show, simple and chic hot pink heels walked down the runway.  I hope you're great at lacing shoes because criss cross laced shoes were trending on the runway for fall and winter.  This light blue pair at Jason Wu had white laces that stood out against sheer black tights.  This suede black pair from Negris Lebrum featured a mesh insert on the side.  Jonathan Simkhai debuted these velvet kitten heels on the runway with matching laces.  Designers applied fur to the outside of their shoes this season to provide unexpected texture.  This tan pair of buckled boots at Coach 1941 had shearling on the sides.  At Laurence and Chico, the classic silhouette of a pump was transformed by using light grey fur and pearls.  Prabal Gurung used white fluff on the tip of his shoes, while the heels featured wooden geometric shapes.

			 Some sweet ideas to thank them for always being there for you. Being a bridesmaid in this day and age often means blowing your money on flights, dresses, gifts for the bride, and getting pampered pre-wedding. Give back to the ones who will stand by your side with these amazing bridesmaid gifts. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Pretty much anyone would appreciate a super thoughtful gift box. This one has a pretty white leather jewelry roll (so their necklaces don’t get all tangled up in transportation), a golden compact mirror, and champagne gummy bears.  The day of the wedding, your attendants will be running back and forth with clothes for the next day and makeup essentials, so they’ll definitely get some good use out of a woven carryall. And they can use this stylish tote as a beach bag after the big day. I’ve personally never met a sheet mask I didn’t adore. At $8 a pop, you could get each of your ’maids a couple, which will have their faces lookin’ right ahead of the big day...or they can use them later to recover from it.  Any expense you can take off your bridesmaids’ plate is an awesome gift. If you can afford to buy the dress they’ll be wearing on the day, it would be a huge burden lifted. If you can’t swing the dress, buying the jewelry that you want them to wear for the wedding isn’t a bad option. This gold lariat necklace goes with everything and is a piece they’ll want to wear well beyond the walk down the aisle. If you’re hoping your attendants will wear bracelets, consider gifting them a piece like this delicate adjustable bracelet. It is subtle enough to not distract from their dresses but glitzy enough to add a little sparkle. These sleek pearl hoops will add a hint of pearl to their looks and be a good everyday piece after the wedding.  Weekender bags are always a useful gift! They’ll use a blush pink one like this for the weekend of the festivities and be able to take it along for whatever trip comes after that. Strapless dresses + any wind on the day of the wedding = cold bridesmaids. A matching pashmina will cover their goosebumps.  A metallic evening bag is something that will definitely come in handy for the wedding and any formal occasion after it.  If you’re planning on having a destination bachelorette party somewhere sunny, the gift of trendy sunglasses will go a long way. If you want pretty getting-ready pics, a stunning silky robe will both help you achieve that goal and be a great gift they can use every morning after. Everyone loves candles, and this one comes in a relaxing, fresh scent with notes of blue hydrangea, hyacinth, and forget-me-nots. The bridesmaids will for sure want to stay hydrated on the day of and afterward, so this makes for the perfect water bottle for their desk or their workout bag.  If you are not into the robe idea but love the thought of your attendants wearing something ~matchy~ while getting ready, consider a cute pajama set that they can keep wearing well after your day. Help your ’maids get some shut-eye with a patterned sleep mask and matching silk pillow case that’s perfect for traveling. Consider getting them a quality lip stain they can wear down the aisle and every night out afterward. Even if you are all getting your makeup professionally done on the big day, they’ll love a brand-new set of brushes that comes in a cute pouch, which they can use to store the brushes or as a travel cosmetics bag. Especially if you have a specific pair in mind for all your bridesmaids to wear, it could be nice to gift them the shoe in their size. If they all already have too much jewelry, get them a trinket dish where they can store it.  Who wouldn’t love receiving this set of two marble bar tools? Again, if you’ve planned a destination bachelorette party, consider getting them something that will come in handy while you’re all there, like a cute cover-up. Whether there’s rain on your special day or not, everyone can always use a good umbrella and this one’s “love is in the air” theme is spot-on. They might not use this watch on the day of (or maybe they will!), but either way, this sleek rose gold and navy blue piece is sure to brighten up any outfit. If you want your bridesmaids to get professional makeup or hair for your wedding day, consider gifting this to them. These services can really add up, and they’ll definitely appreciate it. If you aren’t using pros, consider giving everyone matching lipstick and nail polish to wear that day or travel-size perfume instead. Prices vary.

Get them a sweet winter hat they can incorporate into their lewks on snowy days—that way, they'll never have to deal with hat hair.  A dog person will certainly enjoy this very sweet pouch for headphones and other cords. Anyone who's into astrology or just, like, knowing their future, will get super excited to have their own deck of fortune-telling cards.

This vintage-inspired powder kit will keep them looking refreshed and awake, and, um, who wouldn't love that??

A gold bottle opener will excite any beer, cider, or old-school soda drinker.  These gorgeous lip balms all come with a little flower incased inside.  Nothing's better than a Sunday full of self-care. Help them with their next few with a set of peel-off metallic foil face masks. A non-clunky chain bracelet with pretty rhinestone details that they can wear literally every day. If their sign is an important part of who they are, make sure to give them a candle that's customized to it. If bralettes are their thing, they'll certainly love one that's super simple and comfy in the front, with funky geometric straps in the back. Any jetsetter will die over this stunning accessory that'll protect their passport from the wear and tear of travel. Pretty rose-gold slider clips are a great gift for anyone growing out bangs, or constantly sweeping their face-framing layers behind their ears. These hair ties are all the rage, because they just pull any outfit together. At $8 a pop, get them a few to mix and match!

			 I'm sorry, what? Why should you have to dirty-up a pair of sneakers all by yourself when you can buy them that way? Gucci is going for the whole broken-in look with a pair of sneakers that look like you’ve run a Tough Mudder in them. The men’s Screener Leather Sneakers features Gucci’s famous red and green colors, and they appear like they could have been white…at some point. As you would expect, the luxury designer brand isn’t cheap, and these sneakers are sporting an $870 price tag. “Influenced by classic trainers from the ’70s, the Screener sneakers—named for the defensive sports move feature the Web Stripe on the side and vintage Gucci logo, treated for an allover distressed effect,” the sneaker’s description says. Our favorite part about this shoe is the cleaning instructions: “Clean when the shoe is dry, using only neutral or same-color products to avoid staining.”  The “vintage” look must have been carefully done to look perfectly real, so you don’t want to screw up these fake muddy-looking sneakers.

			 “The world’s most comfortable” shoes just got WAY cuter. Super-comfy shoe brand Allbirds has basically taken over the internet since its 2016 launch. In case you haven’t heard of them, Allbirds are shoes constructed from natural materials like merino wool and tree fiber, which make them sustainable, machine-washable, and also perfect for ultra-cozy steps.    Now, the famous shoe brand has released a new ladylike ballet flat called Tree Breezers ($95), which answer a consumer demand for a more feminine silhouette that goes from day to night (yas, ladies!). They’re also the first line of Allbirds to come in half sizes. The new variation will be the fifth addition to the Tree family, which uses tree fiber sourced from farms that rely only on rainfall—so it substantially cuts down their carbon footprint.       Tree Breezers come in four super-pretty marine-themed colors, from Seashell, a pretty slate gray, to Caribbean, a bright turquoise blue. The material is comfy as the rest of Allbirds sneakers, loafers, and flats, and the bouncy SweetFoam soles (made of sugarcane!) make for a flexible flat that’s comfortable enough to actually dance in right from the first wear, so kiss those break-in blisters good-bye.

			 #2 is genius. Listen, if you don't know about Rent the Runway Unlimited, the subscription that allows you to have up to four new outfits on loan at literally all times, you're really missing out. The service, which costs $159 a month, allows you to scratch that ever-present shopping itch without buying a bunch of cheap clothes that waste space in your closet. But even if you have RTR Unlimited, you may not be getting the most out of it, which is why we crowdsourced longtime users for their best hacks, so you can rent more per month, and live your most fashionable life. Scroll on, friends! SIGN UP NOW Rent the Runway Unlimited, $159 per month on renttherunway.com Every time you choose your outfits, they're shipped to you in a compact, zipable garment bag that you then fill with the clothes again once you've worn them, and ship back. You can choose to wear all your clothing and return all back at once, or return a few pieces so you can get new ones faster. Either way, you'll still have just one bag, so your shipments can only come so fast.  The best hack I've heard of is to try to get multiple bags, but it can be tricky. An easy workaround is to consider buying one of your items, which will automatically free-up one spot without sending anything back. You can then order your next look, which will come in a new bag. There you go — two bags! When you ship back your bag, you securely close the zipper by snapping on a cute little pink lock with the RTR logo. Sometimes the shipping facility will send you multiple locks; other times they'll forget to include it entirely. To avoid sending an insecure bag (which means people potentially could steal items out of it, resulting in you not getting a new outfit, and possibly having to pay for lost items) keep a stash of extra locks handy. If you keep clothing from RTR for a long time, or keep ordering the same thing, that means you truly love it, and it's probably worth buying. Beyond that, it's taking up one of your four-outfit spaces for much longer than it should, and you're essentially spending way more money on that single item without getting to keep it. Most pieces on RTR are for sale at majorly discounted prices to Unlimited members, so either way you're getting a good deal. Make sure to go through all the "new arrivals" regularly — the site inventory changes weekly — and "heart" all the things you like. That way, when you go to grab your next batch of garments, you already have a pool of cute, new stuff to choose from that's been curated by you (and you're not overwhelmed by too many new choices). This next point may seem obvious, but it's something a lot of online shoppers overlook. We all know clothing sizes vary by brand, and this holds true when you rent. Luckily RTR's Unlimited community is awesome at posting reviews and pictures, so you can see how the style you're considering fit on others and make an educated guess on sizing up or down. RTR has a few flagship stores in major cities, where you can make returns and sometimes come away with new items (not every store has the huge selection you see online). Taking your pieces to the brick and mortar location saves you shipping time so you can get more styles faster. The company dry-cleans everything it receives back from customers, but that doesn't always get rid of the serious B.O. scent that sometimes lingers behind. Invest in some fragrance-free Febreze to keep unwanted odors at bay while you wear a less-than-fresh-smelling piece (and avoid the clash of multiple perfumes, etc.). Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Yes, even if you’re not a “hat person.” Even if you’re not the biggest hat wearer, there are tons of unique silhouettes and chic brands out there for you! Want to amp up your fall lewk? Try a newsboy cap. Booking that beachside escape? Def go for an elegant straw hat. And just trying to stay warm this winter? You’ll need a knit beanie. We’ve scoured the internet for the best hat brands out there for every mood and occasion. Here, 20 brands—from dramatic styles to practical ones—that should be on your radar if they aren’t already.  This Amazon brand is v popular (this specific hat has almost 1,500 reviews!) and that’s because it offers quality designs—fedora and straw styles alike—at an actually affordable price. This bold red guy is practically made for crisp, autumn days.  Chances are you’ve heard of this department store staple, and for good reason. Its hats are super cute and put a modern spin on traditional styles, like this textured knit one with a contrasting bill.  Hat Attack is a great go-to brand for fashion-forward silhouettes, like this trendy leopard-print beret. And, whoops, my finger slipped, and I accidentally booked a plane ticket to France just to wear this! If you’re trying to go more old-school with your headwear, you gotta get in on this brand. From driving caps to feathered felt hats, it’ll immediately give any ’fit a retro yet chic flair.  Into wool ones with details around the band? Go with a style from Lanzom, like this pink one with a buckle. And if you’re not into the hue, the brand makes hats in almost every shade imaginable (okay, maybe I’m exaggerating, but it’s a LOT).  Ukrainian milliner Ruslan Baginsky rose to fame after Bella Hadid posted a selfie in its baker boy hat on Instagram—and the designs went viral 24 hours later. (Technology is wild, right?) Top off your fall outfit with one of his ’gram-worthy hats, like this fire-engine red one.  Family-run business Raffaello Bettini has been around since 1938 and is based in Tuscany. True to its Italian roots, you can totally imagine yourself lounging on the Amalfi Coast (or at least your local pool) in one of its designs—take this gorge purple check one.  Here’s another brand for ya that doesn’t require tons of $$$. It features elevated wool berets, like this red one, fedoras, boaters, baker boy hats, you name it—and all below $80 on Nordstrom.  The Australian label is all about combining sun protection with with style when it comes to its straw hats. They have UPF 50+ that prevents exposure to any harmful sun rays and also come in a bunch of hues so you can match your headwear to any ensemble.  Gigi Burris’ accessories are definitely out there—in the best possible way!—if you’re looking to make a statement. I mean, just take in this amazingly large straw hat.  Similar to Wallaroo Hat Company, Lack of Color is another Aussie label that produces a range of elevated hats in all the colors you could possibly want. This wool one also happens to be unisex, if your S.O. is into fedoras.  Albertus Swanpoel is a South African milliner based in New York whose hat designs have also been featured major runway shows like Alexander Wang, Tommy Hilfiger, and Carolina Herrera to name a few. This two-toned beanie will go with twice the colors in your closet!  Janessa Leoné offers hats (and even handbags!) which have become a fave among the celeb and influencer set; plus, all her products, like this burgundy velvet style, are made in the United States.   Genie by Eugenia Kim is an affordable line from Eugenia Kim with super trendy hat designs. Look at these fun lil ears!  This glossy quilted bucket hat by Italian-based designer Reinhard Plank is perfect for transitioning seasons. In addition to his more unique styles, he also designs more traditional woven and felt ones.  Bijou Van Ness has timeless styles that often feature long ties, so they won’t fly off your head with a strong gust of wind. This specific one is part of a chic collab with Reformation and looks just as good with a white tee as it does with a bohemian maxi dress.  In the mood to really splurge on a structured, wow-where’d-you-get-that hat? A modernized version of the classic beret, Eugenia Kim’s Dionne hat is made from wool in a soft gray color. Show yours off by wearing a low ponytail with your hair tucked behind the ears. Lola Hats are designed and made in New York, and it’s a fave of street-style stars and bloggers thanks to its effortless floppy aesthetic.   Sensi Studio creates the dreamiest straw hats and bags worthy of a glam tropical vacation.

			 Thank God squeezing into a corset isn't a must anymore. While lingerie has been around for centuries, it hasn't always looked like the present-day version that comes to mind. From corsets and bloomers to thongs, push-ups, and bralettes, click through to see how much undergarments have transformed through the years.  Corsets date all the way back to the 16th century, and their influence is still around today in the form of controversial waist-trainers, lace-up lingerie, and even modern-day belts. Here, a wedding corset with a sweetheart neckline demonstrates the popular hip boning element for an exaggerated silhouette.  Here, Italian-French opera singer Adelina Patti wears a corset with ribbon detailing on the front, differentiating it from designs where laces were typically featured on the back.  Not all corsets were white or neutral. In the 1880s, colored styles, like this blue and gold one, became more prevalent. More attention was put on making the designs of undergarments just as spectacular and intricate as the dresses worn over them.  In this time period, corsets took on a different form and often featured lacy bloomers or shorts that connected to them. Here, a woman from the Victorian era poses in front of a mirror, showing her undergarments off.   If you've seen any historical movie set around the 19th or 20th century, you'll know that women's pajamas wore typically sheer white nightgowns to bed. This style's looser and flowy-er silhouette was a far cry from the sexy (and extremely tight!) corsets.  The hard-to-breathe-in-them lace-up designs were still around in the 1900s.  During this time, longline styles, which extended well past the hips, were A Thing. Not only did this cinch the waist due to the structured boning and tight laces, but it further exaggerated the the wearer's waistline.   This undergarment style, which included knee-length knickers, was similar to bloomers. However, while the more billowy bloomers often added more volume, these design tapered close to the legs and were and less frilly.  Half-slips, or two-piece sets, were popular during the '20s. Here, a woman wears a lace longline bralette with matching elastic shorts, but the bottoms could be in the form of a skirt as well.  Unlike half-slips, which were two separate pieces, this style was one dress which normally stopped right above the knee. Matching over-the-knee stockings were often paired with them, like the ones pictured here.  Corsets took a lot of time to lace up, so it was only natural for another cinching device—that required less effort—to take its place. Enter: The girdle. The elasticized fabric made it easier to stretch over the wearer's waist, and the design featured suspender clips to hold up sheer stockings.  Simultaneously, matching robe and chemise combinations, made a splash in the '30s. Nightgowns and loungewear began to take a fashionable turn with details like lace insets and sashes, which sharply contrasted the more plain, shapeless styles that had been prevalent.  While the strapless bra technically popped up in the '30s, it took some time to catch on and have widespread use. Here, a model poses in one of bra designer Jack Glick's strapless styles in 1946.  Clearly, the '40s was a time of lingerie ingenuity. Apparently Charles L. Langs invented these stick-ons so women could achieve an even tan when sunbathing without having to struggle with their bathing suit straps.  During this decade, midi dresses and skirts were spotted everywhere and so were the petticoats worn underneath them. The tiered layers added more volume to women's ensembles—as well as a subtle touch of sexiness if you could see the lace peak out from under the hem.  Sexy sleepwear became more prevalent in the '50s, as evidenced by these sheer nighties worn over high-waisted bottoms and matching bras. The nightgowns typically had a scoop neckline featuring a ruffle or two for some extra pizzazz.  Ruffles and frills were added to the edges of almost all lingerie in this period: bra cups, straps, underwear—you name it. The voluminous effect made the pieces seem more playful.  Also common in this era? Dainty chemises, like the one pictured here. This drop waist style features lace trim, spaghetti straps, and a sheer pleated skirt that reflected the fashion of the day.  When bohemian culture dominated in the '70s, it was also reflected in the lingerie. Take this lacy bodysuit with a built-in skirt, for instance. It was less overtly sexy and gave off more of a care-free spirit which embodied the time period.   Loud patterns were also part of '70s style (polka dots, paisleys, plaid, etc.), so this floral embroidered bra and panty set makes total sense for the time. The dark contrasting ensures that it makes a bold statement, while the bottoms have a slight ruching reminiscent of the previous decade's frilly trend.  Lace-up dresses, vests, and blouses surged in popularity at this time too, and the same trend was reflected in some undergarments, like this matching white set with a criss-cross detail at the cleavage.   The eye-catching colors and metallic fabrics of the '80s were a huge leap from the romantic hippy vibes of the previous decade. Take this model's purple set, for example. And perhaps even more "eighties" than the hue and material were the prevalent high-cut silhouettes of underwear, also seen here.  Cone—or bullet—bras were nothing new (the '40s and '50s also had this going on), but when Madonna wore hers, it made the shape go down in brassiere history. Here, she wore a black teddy with pointed tassels on the bra cups while performing in Los Angeles.  Nineties maximalist fashion trends were certainly not boring. The mismatched colors and patterns that appeared in lingerie was a reflection of the "more is more" mindset of this decade.  Contrastingly, a concurrent minimalism trend (think simple slip dresses, spaghetti straps, and pastel colors) was also popular, and manifested itself in undergarments too. Take this basic, but pretty set in a pewter shade modeled by Tyra Banks.  With the new millennium came more flashy fashion, which included rhinestone details on bra bands and waistbands as seen here.  Head-to-toe matching get ups, like Paris Hilton's white bra, skirt, and stockings, were definitely A Thing during this decade—especially when paired with fuzzy pink accessories.  Although push-ups were invented in the 1940s, at the height of Victoria's Secret's popularity in the 2010s, they were all anyone wore—the brand's "Bombshell" bra practically dominated the industry. Here, Angel Adriana Lima models the Fantasy Bra, which was a push-up style, ahead of the Victoria's Secret fashion show.  Outfits suddenly became more sheer in the mid 2010s. The solution? Underwear rose higher and lingerie sets became more simple so as not to detract from the garment worn over it. Here, a model sports a black high-waisted lingerie set with subtle scalloped details underneath a mesh dress at a runway show.  Wearing underwear as outerwear—or making lingerie the focal point of an outfit—was a trend that gained traction in 2015, as demonstrated by Bella Hadid's sheer ensemble that showed off her lacy black bra.  Almost as a response to the overwhelming popularity of the push-up bra, brands began focusing on the bralette, which lacks the padding, wires, and clasps that traditional bras were known for. Here, a model wears a lacy triangle design.

			 Dress from the feet up.  No matter how amazing your outfit is, never underestimate the importance of shoes—they can totally make or break a look, it's true. With that in mind, keep up to date on all the footwear trends 2019 has to offer, from lucite heels to feather details and everything in between. Here, 22 styles to have on your radar the next time you go shopping.  Sure, leopard and cheetah prints are perhaps the most common animal patterns, but try a fun cow print too, as seen on Burberry's runway. Solid heels are SO 2018, and next year transparent, lucite heels will be where it's at. At Chanel's Spring 2019 runway show, models wore peep-toe slides with see-through details that gave the silhouette a fresh new look.  The "ugly" shoe trend isn't going away any time soon, and these thick-soled Teva sandals that appeared at the Collina Strada runway show are basically proof. Get ready to embrace the more practical, functional style come 2019. A ton of salmon-colored shoes came down the Spring/Summer catwalks, so it makes total sense that Pantone chose "Living Coral" as its 2019 color of the year. These patent-leather kicks, which appeared on the Zero + Maria Cornejo runway, totally embodied the shade and featured a contrasting pale pink strap.  Combat boots are a wardrobe staple because they're versatile and hold up over time, but this year, it's all about taking the design to new heights with a statement heel. Here, a model at the Christian Cowan runway show wore a pair that also featured rhinestones.  Thong-style slides are making a very fashionable return, as evidenced by this striped pair on the Etro runway. Expect to see more upscale versions of the flip flop during 2019's warmer-weather months. While 2018 saw the rise of the extremely pointy shoe—take Balenciaga's "knife pumps," for instance—come next year, it'll be all about sporting a square toe. On the Fendi runway, models wore pumps like this hot-pink pair with contrasting black details. Another trend worth noting? Unusual colors like seafoam or mint green, as seen at Carolina Herrera. Think of 2019 as a year to experiment with bold hues like this one, making your footwear the focal point of any outfit.  Speaking of color, another one hitting 2019 is cobalt blue. The hard-to-miss shade popped up on these slingbacks at Marc Jacobs' show, as well as many other runways during fashion week.  Leather and more structured materials are usually common when it comes to footwear, but next year, rich textiles and fabrics are going to be a thing. Think of the patterns you see on ornate rugs or draperies, except now on your shoes. This bright jacquard slide complete with a starfish embellishment made a splash on the Michael Kors runway.  Similar to the lucite heel, tinted PVC takes the see-though element to the whole entire shoe. Designers had fun with the material during fashion week, popping up on models' feet in a variety of colors, such as this gray shade at LaQuan Smith.  You might not have seen lavender boots before, but the hue seemed like a total must-have when it appeared at Kate Spade's show. Yes, pastels are a given in spring, but be prepared to see this shade all year long, whether it's on sandals or booties.  Fringe made an appearance on Longchamp's runway in the form of these knee-high gladiator sandals, and while the trend was in excess here, you can also sport shoes with just a hint of the detail for a more subtle look.  Lace-up shoes are still going strong, but in 2019, consider the style using rope instead. These sandals at Milly's show were basically the perfect summertime shoe for next year.  Stay with me here: The humble clog shoe is making a comeback. While they are synonymous with the bohemian fashion of the '70s, labels like Miu Miu are giving them stylish updates, like the architectural wooden sole seen here.  The takeover of dainty, tiny straps is imminent in 2019, as seen on these multicolored sandals at Rejina Pyo's runway show.  On the Jacquemus runway, sculptural designs like lace-ups with spherical heels turned these shoes into walking works of art. And, in 2019, the more artsy your footwear is, the better.  Neon isn't just a trend for clothes—it includes shoes as well, as seen on these thigh-high suede boots at The Blonds runway show.  Your feet are about to be SO secure, fam. That because buckles are about to hit the shoe scene in a big way. I'm talking more than just one or two, and to illustrate, see these excessively-buckled heels at the Sies Marjan runway show.  Mesh is a godsend if your feet tend to overheat. It's seen here on the the Tibi runway in the form of white ankle boots with kitten heels and inserts of the breezy fabric.  Can't decide between colors? You're in luck: Multicolored leather shoes featuring braided texture are about to blow up. Here, a model wears a pair of Ulla Johnson lace-up heels featuring black, white, brown, and yep, you guessed it, cobalt blue.  While feathers might not be the most practical of features, they sure are pretty to look at. Here, burgundy sandals with buckles and feathered details at the back appeared on the Valentino runway.

			 Wooden soles > regular soles.     IDK if you need to sit down for this news, but here it is: The humble clog, with its clunky wooden sole and bohemian vibe, is More. Stylish. Than. Ever. Really!!! It popped up in recent runway shows like Lanvin, Molly Goddard, Miu Miu, and even Dior, proving this point in a major way (see the high-fashion pics below). Once I picked up on the trend, I started to notice them EVERYWHERE. I spotted them on the subway, they were popping up in all my favorite stores, and I even heard saw coworkers sporting them.  
  The New Yorker has dubbed wearers of the iconic shoe the “clogerati,” and you can’t turn a sidewalk corner in NYC without seeing at least one member. In an age where “ugly” shoes are becoming more prominent than your standard high heels and flats (based on my own anecdotal evidence, at least), there has never been a better time to fully welcome the clog—arguably 2019’s newest “it” shoe—into your life.  Need further convincing? No. 6 clogs have gained an almost cultlike following, Aidy Bryant’s character, Annie, dons several pairs in her new Hulu show Shrill, and there’s even an Instagram account dedicated to the #ClogLife.   SHRILL on @hulu MARCH 15. 💗💕💗💕💗 GET READY TO LOVE @lollyadefope LIKE I DO. A BEAUTIFUL BABY WITH A HEART OF GOLD. 💗💕💗 A post shared by  aidybryant (@aidybryant) on Dec 11, 2018 at 5:43pm PST The styles don’t all look like you emerged straight out of the base of a windmill in the Netherlands, by the way. They come in the classic round-toe slides but also have open-toe silhouettes and more strappy designs if you’re going for a nontraditional iteration. If you want to join the ~clogerati~ yourself, slip on the below shoes for size. #ClogLife starts now.

			 The brand's most comfortable flat got even more comfortable. Everlane, the sustainable fashion brand that focuses on ethics and transparency, just came out with shoes that are meant to last in terms of durability and style. You may recognize the style of the brand new Day Glove ReKnit ($98)—it looks just like the brand's classic Day Glove, their leather shoe that molds to the shape of your foot to (as the name suggests) fit like a glove.  The Day Glove ReKnit takes the comfort level up one step further thanks to an innovative knit fabric that is lightweight, super-breathable, and completely recycled (each pair is made from eight renewed plastic bottles!). So you'll definitely feel good about wearing them too. Retailing at $98, the Day Glove ReKnit is available in red, pink, yellow, black, and white. You can shop the shoe in sizes 5 through 11, half sizes included. They're elegantly chic yet simple enough to complement any outfit. The Day Glove ReKnit comes part of Everlane's newest summer arrivals, including the Tiny Tee, the Form Three-Strap Sandal, the Form Thong Sandal, and the Silk Notch Shirt. Made of comfy, sustainable material, these Day Glove ReKints remind us of Allbirds Tree Breezers flats that were released earlier this month, and the much-beloved Rothy's. What do you think?

			 Why would I clutter my closet with a gown I'd never wear again? It was a dress I definitely would not have chosen for myself—and in fact, someone else helped me pick it out. But there I was getting married in it. And another person would end up wearing the same one—like, the exact gown—the following week. That might sound a liiiiitle weird to someone else, but to me, renting my wedding dress was a total no-brainer. Lemme back up: The dress—a knee-length, all-white Badgley Mischka number with can’t-miss-’em bell sleeves—was from Rent the Runway, which launched a “wedding concierge” service last year, not long after I got engaged. The company offers packages based on the amount of clothing you think you’ll need for the onslaught of events leading up to the big day—and best of all, for the wedding itself. And the designers, including Temperley London and Christian Siriano, are no joke either. You also get a free accessory for every look and a personal stylist who can help with orders—in my case, she even decided on the dress I ended up wearing because I’d already tried on, like, a thousand options and none of them felt right.  Rent the Runway isn’t the only company letting you borrow white dresses with bridal vibes. Style Lend, an NYC-based business, operates a similar inventory stocked with designers like Self-Portrait, Zimmermann, and Brandon Maxwell. Borrowing Magnolia also sells previously worn wedding looks at a major discount. Nowadays, you can even lease accessories like veils from a site called Happily Ever Borrowed. I had no desire to clutter my closet with a ginormous gown I’d never wear again. So yeah, this was a lifesaver for me—I had no desire to clutter my closet with a ginormous white gown I’d never wear again. I get that some people like to keep The Dress for sentimental reasons for their kids. But the reality is that they probably won’t end up wanting to wear the same thing you did. (Let’s not even talk about your mom’s bridal shoulder pads.) Plus, I didn’t want to blow a ton of cash. This wasn’t my only wedding—just the first one, with a justice of the peace, to make us “official.” We had a big Indian celebration with friends and family—with a traditional red-and-gold dress by an Indian designer—a few months later. Even if it had been my only wedding dress, I can think of so many more useful ways to spend my money: a live band, a late-night snack buffet, an open bar. I’ve got priorities. My friends who are about to tie the knot are starting to get wise to the rental thing now—even the ones going for the full-blown princess look. And to anybody who doesn’t get it, I say: I have the memories and the pics—what else do I really need? The closet space, that’s what.

			 W-O-W.  On Sunday in Los Angeles, Kim Kardashian graced BeautyCon with her presence and wore possibly her most jaw-dropping look ever—you be the judge: Just so you know, it's actually a vintage Dolce & Gabbana long sleeve dress that looks like a crop top and skirt, but photos taken from the back angle reveal that the two seemingly separate pieces are connected.    Her button-down skirt revealed none other than a sexy pair of spandex bike shorts, which she's sported on more than one occasion. Kim kept her accessories to a minimum, only pairing her ensemble with a tiny bag and gray lace-up heels to keep the attention on her barely-there outfit.    Daughter North also attended the event and matched her beauty-mogul mom with a black feather-detailed dress and the same pulled-up hairstyle. Kim is fresh off her newest Kimoji fragrance launch, which features fruity, summer scents, and, in an Instagram Story, she also called North "My perfume tester."  Talk about a dream job. Can I help too, Kim? Follow Lauren on Instagram.

Here's a refreshing break from the crazy stuff that happens in the world on a daily basis: Nineteen-year-old Mika Riddick from Maryland realized prom season was imminent last week and decided to tweet out pictures of her dress form 2016, stating that she was willing to let someone use it for prom, free of charge.   Her exact words: "HI i’m willing to let a girl in *need* use my prom dress. USE FOR THE NIGHT. I need you to be in MD, specifically glen burnie or close to. I have shoes for you as well as a makeup artist if you need that as well. IM NOT CHARGING YOU ANYTHING, JUST HAVE A GREAT NIGHT!!!!!" The tweet has received close to 38,000 likes, and over 13,000 retweets. "I didn't expect [the tweet] to get this much attention at all," she told Yahoo. "It's something I'd do on a normal day for anyone. I'm really happy this all happened though." By that last statement, she means the sheer number of people following her lead. All over the country, others are offering up their own prom dresses in various styles and sizes. Ugh this is soooo nice. I also have three dresses I’m willing to let a lady who is in need use for a night! I may or may not be able to provide shoes! But I can provide you a beat face by yours truly @KiyaShaco✨ DM ME. pic.twitter.com/X5g6VNqTkN Services — like makeup and  hair, or even photography — are also up for grabs for those in need. "As much as others are touched, they have inspired me just as much," Riddick said. "I want [selfless] things like this to not be so abnormal."  Now, everyone go out there and have an amazing prom night. Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBeauty. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Why? For one, they save SO much time.  Almost every morning I wake up not knowing WTF I'm going to wear. The thought of figuring out what top goes with what bottom is too overwhelming when I'm on my fifth snooze-button push and am half asleep trying to get my ass out the door and onto the subway.  Enter the life-changing world of matching sets (also known as co-ords or two-pieces or fashion's best invention...whatever you want to call them). They are literally separates made to be worn together, which means your outfit is automatically picked out for you with minimal brainpower involved. All you have to do is choose your shoes, sling a bag over your shoulders, and voilà! You'll look so polished and not at all like you took 30 seconds to throw on an outfit.  
  But not only are they great for catching up on some sleep, they're also seriously budget-friendly, considering that you get three outfits for the price of one. Yes, you can wear them together, but you can also opt to just to wear the top or wear only the bottoms with other pieces. I mean, it's really genius.  Below I break down ALL the possibilities, so you can get in on this kinda-sorta hack for looking fabulous in no time flat.  Bring on the Prints  If you're going to wear co-ords, you might as well get started with a statement look, such as this cute black-and-white gingham top-and-pants with a paper-bag waist. The bold pattern-on-pattern style is definitely eye-catching, but the fact that you can wear them separately too, mixing and matching prints for an equally standout situation is even better. I paired this outfit with cherry earrings and a cherry beaded bag (so even the accessories went with each other!) and then I added an unexpected pop of color with these pastel-blue slide sandals. All Bundled Up   Sweater sets are more comfortable than any other two-pieces (for obvious reasons), and they also transition well between winter and spring when the temps range from freezing to just mildly chilly. A bright orange one like this is nothing like your typical gray loungewear—the top is off-the-shoulder and breezy while the skirt is more fitted with slits. To go along with the color scheme, I added a coordinating neon purse and tri-colored heels.  Suits (No, Not the Meghan Markle Show)  Out of all the sets, suits are the most ~powerful~. You're basically guaranteed to look like a boss bitch any time you wear one. The best part? They don't always have to be fancy. Take this blue checkered one, for instance. You can wear it with flats, like I did here, to be more caj. But if you like that more professional vibe, feel free to dress it up with heels or boots. If a structured blazer isn't really your thing, you can also pair the pants with a sweater or simple T-shirt to make it more low-key (but still cute!).    Actually Acceptable Pajamas to Wear in Public A chic pajama set you can wear outside the house? Sign me up. There's plenty of sleepwear out there that looks like, well, NOT sleepwear, and, from experience, it feels downright heavenly to wear to the office. Did I mention that this striped ensemble has feather-trimmed pants that look even more amazing with a pair of simple heels? Basically, you can wear it to bed, to work, and then wear each piece on its own—the button-down with a pair of jeans and the pants with a long-sleeve top and flats—which makes this one of the most versatile kinds of sets.  Hell Yes to Skirt Sets   Because of the contrast of a shorter hemline on the bottom and long-sleeves on the top, a skirt-and-jacket combo strikes the perfect balance of casual and elevated. I wore a short-sleeve striped shirt under the oversize top and matched the dark khaki corduroy look with tan sneakers and fun socks, then finished it off with a simple black crossbody bag. To give it a more sophisticated spin, all I'd do is take off the jacket and trade in my sneaks for a pair of trendy mules, and there ya have it—two easy outfits in one.  Have I Convinced You These Are the Best Yet? Okay, you caught me: This is just an ode to matching sets because they make my life easier and are perfect to mix and match with other clothes. If you haven't yet experienced the magic of setting your morning alarm a mere 20 minutes before you need to leave—because you don't have to stress about getting a stylish outfit together—then. Drop. What. You're. Doing. And shop even more sets below.

			 True heirlooms. Princess Diana—a.k.a. Prince William and Prince Harry's late mother—left her entire jewelry collection (the pieces that don't officially belong to the crown) to her sons, reportedly hoping they would pass it along to their spouses. We've already seen Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle wearing many of these pieces out in public. Scroll through to see them in all their sparkly glory. Prince Charles gave Princess Diana a sapphire ring with a diamond halo for their engagement. It now sits on Prince William's wife, Kate Middleton's, ring finger. The Duchess of Cambridge pictured with Diana's sparkling sapphire engagement ring. The Duchess of Sussex's engagement ring contains two stones from Harry's mom's collection. This tiara was made for Queen Mary in 1914 and given to Princess Diana in 1981. It is now called the "Cambridge Lover's Knot" because it is part of William and Kate's collection.  Here's Kate arriving to a state dinner in the statement piece. The diamond butterfly earrings Meghan's wearing here on her royal tour of Australia were originally owned by Princess Diana. The gold bracelet—which Meghan often paired with the butterfly earrings on said tour—were also previously owned by Harry's mother. Prince William reportedly gave Kate a pair of sapphire earrings previously owned by the Princess of Wales to match her engagement ring after their marriage. Kate had them refashioned into the design you see here. This light blue large-stone cocktail ring reportedly came in a set with a matching bracelet.  Meghan wore the ring during her wedding reception as her "something blue." This more subtle three-strand pearl bracelet was originally designed for Diana in 1988.

			 "It's gonna be crazy." If you follow Cardi B on Instagram, you know how much she LOVES Fashion Nova. It seems like every week she's got a fly new outfit on and a caption that includes the brand. But now there's even more reason for her to rep them on her page — she has a new collaboration in the works. On Thursday, she told Apple Music Beats 1, "With Fashion Nova, they gave me the opportunity to design what I like and what I want to put out, and I’m gonna put out a line with them, a little something-something..."  And as far as what it's going to look like: "It’s gonna be crazy because it’s what I like." Yassss!! Other details, like when it will launch, or how much it will cost, have not been disclosed.  Cardi's stylist Kollin Carter is also a major fan of the retailer. "That was a brand that was lending to her before anybody believed in her," he recently said. "They worked together way before [she hired] me. I always have respect for her Fashion Nova moments, because it is a part of who she is. They have amazing basics. If I can't find a go-to denim, which I normally can't find go-to denim for her from a high-end designer, Fashion Nova always has a perfect denim for her. They cater to women with curves." Carter and Cardi have paired Fashion Nova basics with pretty much every high-end designer, including Ralph Lauren, Versace, and Christian Siriano. Obviously, this is a match made in heaven. Cardi, plz spill more info soon! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Amazon Prime, FTW. Father's Day is June 16, and although you have ample time to buy something right now, but there's a chance you'll forget and then be in a real bind. Thankfully, for all us procrastinators out there, Amazon Prime exists. Scroll on to shop the best last-minute gifts for dad that you can have shipped to your home in two days' time. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! He'll be able to blast his tunes from literally anywhere. These retro-inspired sunnies will make his beach style way more fashionable. He could use a transitional jacket upgrade, so why not this cute dark-wash denim piece? Does anyone like to vaccuum? Well, maybe if there was a cute li'l robot doing all the work for your dad, he would.  Sleek slip-ons like this pair will upgrade any of his weekend outfits. Yeah, yeah, we all know about hot sauce, buffalo sauce, and barbecue sauce, but this sweet and spicy combo of chili-infused honey will really take his ribs to another level. Speaking of barbecues—if he considers himself a master griller, it could be time to get him a set of new badass-looking tools. This speaker comes integrated with Amazon's "Alexa," so he can control his playlist with his voice, check the news, and even program lighting in his home. Never too late to try something new for your skin. This top-rated set might be just the refresh he needs. Your dad may not typically keep up with fashion, but he can always use a good pair of new jeans. His date night just got a major upgrade with this casual blazer. A classic-looking time piece will keep him punctual and stylish. If he loves to fix things, this new drill will light up his life. This New York Times best-selling book has it all: shark attacks, top-secret military opps, and wrongfully court-martialed captain.  He can store his go-to brew in this keg-slash-growler, which will keep it fresh. If your dad's anything like mine, he's always trying to make sure your safe and prepared for anything. This gadget has tons of little tools that'll help him in an emergency, all encased in a handy flashlight. Dads aren't known for their swim style typically. Help him out by getting him a basic but well-proportioned pair of trunks that'll go with anything.  How snazzy is this set of chrome bar tools in its bamboo stand? If he fancies himself an aspiring photographer, gift him the quality gear he needs to kick his skills up a notch. If he loves wine, he'll get a lot of use out of this purifier, which will take out the pesky sulfates that are at the root of most hangovers. If whites, Champagnes, or rosés are more his thing, he'll definitely appreciate this stainless steel chiller that will insulate his favorite bottles. These sleek new tennis shoes are the perfect upgrade for his older, beat-up kicks. He could always use a new dress shirt for work or a dinner out. Perfect for a summer day on the beach, a park, or out on a boat—he'll love this caddy that can carry six bottles while keeping them cold. It also comes with a connected bottle opener! It's cheesy, but then again, a shirt that says "Best. Dad. Ever." will definitely make him smile. Okay, this gift is on the pricier side, but what dad wouldn't have a blast with a portable paddle board he can inflate and take anywhere?

			 The Fug Girls spill the tea on who rocked the red carpet. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. We used to think of the Golden Globes as the beginning of awards season, but what if it’s the Emmys? Just like back-to-school festivities, people have just had a long and (theoretically) restful summer, they’re probably a lot tanner than usual, and they’re excited to shake up the class with some brand-new fancy duds. The question is, then, who got an A and who needs improvement? Here are some of our picks. This was the most unexpected trend of the night. By our latest count, five actresses arrived in floaty gowns that fused red and pink fabric, a very on-the-nose valentine to TV. We had a hard time picking one we thought was flawless, but we’re giving the win here to Mandy for leaning alllll the way in to 1980s nighttime soap realness. In this, she could hurl a martini at her enemy, ruin a wedding, or slip it off and step into a bathtub while someone else’s husband gawks. When This Is Us ends, maybe she should consider this as a career move.   It’s unusual to wear separates to the Emmys; it’s even more unusual to wear a white oxford to an awards show, although Sharon Stone once taught us all that when done correctly, it’s unforgettable. And this iteration is so crisp, so sexy, so modern, so damn good.   This is quite possibly just our favorite cast, period, but Schitt’s Creek took five long seasons to get Emmy recognition, and we’re beyond pleased to see them all sparkling so brightly on the red carpet. All these dishy Canadians in one shot is just another compelling reason to investigate moving there. She didn’t win for Veep—this time, anyway—but Julia is victorious in pretty much every other aspect, including the way she’s carrying this sexy gold sequined gown. So she didn’t break the all-time performing Emmy record tonight? Big deal. She’ll smash it with whatever she does next, and we can’t wait. Or should we just call her Guinevere? That emerald hue is wonderful on Lilly, who looks faintly like the prom queen of TV we hope she becomes: It’s a big deal that a bisexual woman of color is breaking into the traditionally very white and male world of network late-night shows, and hopefully, she’ll come back in future years as a nominee herself. Warrior queen Cersei would rather die than show up anywhere in something this floaty and floral. However—SPOILER—Cersei did, in fact, die, so we commend Lena for swinging so far in the other direction, neatly reminding us all that she’s not actually a coldhearted snake, even if she played one on TV. Natasha has really been leaning in to some glitz, and this almost vintage-looking gold Gucci is shimmery and sexy and saucy in a way that her old all-black wardrobe never showcased. Maybe she and Mandy Moore can star in that soap opera together. Mj, of Pose, talked very enthusiastically about wanting her dress to be a sharp, angular, precise pop of color, telling E! that this night represented the first time she’d truly been taken seriously, so she sought a gown that would give that its due. Mission heartily accomplished: She looks fantastic. Nicole is perfect in this canary sparkler. We might even go so far as to say she...wait for it, WAIT FOR IT...nailed it. When she was interviewed on the red carpet, Niecy apologized in advance if one of her boobs popped out (it did not). Niecy has never shown up at an event looking less than the bodacious babe she is, and she definitely wasn’t going to end the trend this year. Bonus points for that great sparkly headpiece.  This might be a personal best for Michelle Williams, whose partnership with Louis Vuitton has tended toward the twee.  The pattern is gorgeous, the cut is simple but stunning. She’s never looked better. It’s the perfect dress to win in—thank goodness she did. This red carpet was, all things told, quite pretty, but a great many people played it fairly safe. Not Kendall. This is fascinating and fun and really bold on her—and, not for nothing, probably extremely sweaty in L.A.’s weather conditions on Sunday. A round of applause for trying this—both for pulling it off sartorially and actually physically pulling it off later. Latex gets sticky. It’s a statement of how very dramatic Billy Porter often looks on a red carpet that our first take on this look—which involves 100,000 crystals!—was, “Oh, sort of understated on Billy tonight.” (In our defense, this is a person who was carried into the Met Gala on a golden litter.) The good news is, it proves Billy is just as much a fashion plate when he’s “relaxing” as he is when he’s got it turned up to 11. You might look at this and wonder how, exactly, this qualifies as a makeunder, but this is Halsey we’re talking about here. She once wore a belt as a shirt, and the last time we saw her in public, she was wearing a pleather loincloth-dress. By those standards, this is understated—and by any standards, it’s glorious. We are generally not fans of gowns with this much visible boning—finish your dress!—but we cannot deny that Zendaya still looks stunning in it. She should come with her own Don’t Try This at Home warning.  We don’t love Laverne’s ruffled gown—it’s sort of overwrought—but her custom Edie Parker bag is exceptional, so who even cares about the dress? On October 8, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in regards to whether LGBTQ+ workers are protected against workplace discrimination; Laverne’s date was Chase Strangio, the ACLU lawyer who will be arguing the case. Let us put to rest once and for all the idea that fashion is synonymous with frivolity: Laverne is using this platform to raise awareness about something essential, and in our book, that makes her best-dressed no matter what she’s wearing. Visit the Fug Girls on their website or follow them on Twitter. Their book, The Royal We, is available here.

			 So, so pretty.  I’ll just go ahead and say you’re welcome already, because all the stress of finding your girlfriend the perfect gift just went right out the door.

She’ll be turning heads and getting lots of likes with this very on-trend mini-bag. Its croc-like effect and unique structural form make it a statement piece that pairs well with a range of #OOTDs. The expression is “to wear your heart on your sleeve,” but with a belt like this one, she might like wearing “love” on her waist even more. This chain hip-belt features the Italian word “amore” and looks cool as hell with jeans. Cast a spell of scent with a mix of cedar, sandalwood, pine, and a pinch of thyme and aromatic patchouli. If your girlfriend is Harry Potter–obsessed, she’ll definitely love a Hermione candle. Why have one fragrance when you can have the best selection of them all? A travel set of Le Labo’s most-loved scents means she can always enjoy an array of spritzes. If she loves rosé (and let’s be real…who doesn’t?), introduce her to the silky yet crisp taste of a unique vodka and rosé wine blend. The floral flavor features notes of Honeycrisp apple, sweet pea blossoms, and a hint of oak. If she considers wine a daily essential, hand-painted glassware could be her new take on an old classic. This subtly colorful design makes the experience of wine-drinking even better than it already is. For cosmetics with a bit of couture, gift her a Chanel foundation brush. The super-soft bristles ensure your girlfriend will have an even makeup look with that always sought-after polished glow. No more stealing your ratty old T-shirts. Treat her to a pajama set that makes going to sleep look and feel pretty damn cute. This eco-friendly set is 100% cotton for comfort she can feel good about.

This porcelain vessel for her morning beverage is like a daily dose of good vibes. Buying clothes for your significant other isn’t easy, but you really can’t go wrong with a lightweight sweatshirt. This high-quality option from Monrow pairs nicely with leather leggings but can also be dressed down for a casual afternoon at home. Find a unique home for all those selfies you’ve taken together using these polaroid-style coasters. They have a slim casing that can be filled with your own photos for a personalized touch to any surface. Consider a pair of crystal and gold-plated brass earrings with dramatic blue tassels, for accessories that promise to stand out no matter what she wears them with. A sleek but simple silk top will be her go-to look for your next date night. Depending on what you’ve got planned, she can dress it up with a skirt and heels or keep it casual with high-waisted jeans and boots. Who knew a hand-painted seashell could be both beautiful and practical? This makes for a charming accent to any space and is perfect for holding all her rings and trinkets. This gift is like giving your girlfriend a hug, but better. A weighted blanket uses the same comforting pressure as a hug to elicit feelings of calmness and relaxation, so she can have a good snuggle even when you’re not there. This tiny ring with hearts will be her favorite new accessory. Yogis will appreciate a versatile gift that provides a little extra help perfecting difficult poses and meditation practices. Made of soft and scratch-proof foam, these yoga blocks are easy for her to use and carry. This gift promises a future filled with breakfasts in bed. The nifty gadget can prepare up to seven eggs at a time, however she takes them (omelettes included!). Plus, it’s a fun pop of color for the kitchen countertop. If she’s always up on the latest in tech, here’s something she probably hasn’t seen before: A gift that can set the mood at touch of a finger. A connected dimmer switch allows her to control, monitor, and schedule lighting throughout the home using a phone app. If you’re dating a coffee connoisseur, this French press is just what she needs to upgrade her daily routine. It features brushed stainless steel and a pretty copper finish for a classy start to the day. For the avid runner, a digitally connected sneaker that will track, analyze, and store information for every performance could be the key to reaching her fitness goals. Plus, these are light and comfortable while still providing excellent traction in slippery conditions. For the woman who always has her computer with her, consider a blush leather pouch that’s as cool as it is useful. It has a laptop sleeve with a pocket for all her tech accessories and snaps that hold everything securely in place. Consider this your best lesson in gift giving: Gucci is always a good idea. The brand’s quilted red leather card holder is a classic choice that’s guaranteed to please. Is your girlfriend a total boss? Upgrade her office space accordingly with a fancy writing utensil. Filled with clear crystals, this elegant pen will make it more fun to put pen to paper. Cool women support other women, and buying this 100 percent cotton T-shirt doesn’t just celebrate some of the greatest female artists in the world, it also means a donation will be made to the National Museum of Women in the Arts.

			 Including, yes, Uggs. Shoe trends come and go—and then come back again. Click through to see the past 53 years of pumps, slides, platforms, clogs, peep-toes, and, yes, even Uggs.  Love nostalgic trends? Want more? Subscribe here! Brigitte Bardot wore the classic style, which was comfortable thanks to the little heel but dressy due to the pointed toe. Natalie Wood was pictured outside her house wearing long, white socks with matching shoes—a popular, albeit unusual, pairing in the ’60s.  Go-go boots—like the bright-orange pair that Paula Kelly wore to the 41st Academy Awards—were popularized in the mid-’60s and remained a trend through the end of the decade.  In the ’70s, other boot styles, like these suede knee-highs worn by Ali McGraw, were also all the rage. Carly Simon wore a suede version of the popular style while out in London.  Vanessa Redgrave dressed up her  calf-high boots with a miniskirt and sweater, accessorizing with a cute beret. English model and actress Jean Shrimpton wore these black shoes with pantyhose and a matching patent-leather dress. Chanel relaunched its classic slingbacks in 2015 and the style remains popular. Mary Janes were popular among kids, like Jodie Foster pictured here on the TV show Paper Moon, and grown-ups alike.  Jackie Onassis and her stepdaughter, Christina, wore these block-heel loafers as they touched down in Greece. Like kitten heels, the block heel had a sensible height but still worked for dressier occasions.  Goldie Hawn gave these slip-ons a Victorian feel with her ruffled shirt and velvet dress.  Geraldine Chaplin (yes, Charlie Chaplin’s daughter!) wore sneakers behind the scenes of A Wedding, which she filmed with fellow actress Mia Farrow. Even her son got in on the trend!   Jane Fonda wore hers with socks and a pantsuit.  Pairing slouchy boots with long coats or dresses was a popular silhouette in this period, exemplified perfectly by Meryl Streep.  The ’80s ushered in an era of edgier shoe trends, as seen here on Gloria Estefan, who wore black leather boots with buckle detailing while performing at a concert.  Diana Ross wore the classic pump, which was also an ’80s office-attire staple, during this CBS television special with Michael Jackson.  There’s no better fit for a princess than a classic, bow-adorned ballet flat—the style was a must for Princess Diana’s visit to the Isles of Scilly off the coast of England.  Vanessa Williams wore peep-toe shoes, which had a comeback from the retro and pinup era of the ’40s and ’50s, onstage at the Miss America pageant. Actress Jane Seymour (far right) wore a satin version of the famous T-strap style.  There’s nothing that screams the ’80s like patent leather, and Tina Turner knew what was up when she wore these pumps while performing at Madison Square Garden.  Troy Beyer (from Dynasty fame) wore the ultimate ’80s look at this celebrity fashion show: big curls, a prom-looking taffeta dress, and, of course, matching satin slippers.  The comfort shoe was a fixture on the red carpet, as seen here on Jamie Lee Curtis. [Editor’s note: A previous version of this article accidentally omitted the year 1987.] The ’80s were all about head-to-toe embellished looks, and Whitney Houston’s rhinestone-studded ankle-strap shoes perfectly coordinated with her glittery Grammys ensemble.  Madonna paired the flat shoes with ankle socks, Bermuda shorts, and a leather jacket during a dance-a-thon.  Demi Moore kicked off the ’90s with these pointy flats, which she wore to the premiere of Dances With Wolves in California.  Also making a big splash in the ’90s were giant platform sandals, as modeled by Naomi Campbell at Chanel’s Spring/Summer ’92 show in Paris. Everyone wanted a pair of these shoes, no matter how unsteady they seemed.  Actress Sharon Stone was spotted wearing a casual look at LAX.  With the ’90s came the rise of grunge culture, and combat boots were a common sight on the red carpet—as seen here on model Christie Brinkley, who wore a pair to the grand opening of the Sony Plaza in New York City.   Sky-high stilettos were also a popular style in the ’90s, and look! Sandra Bullock is having so much fun wearing them!  Diva extraordinaire Mariah Carey made wearing strappy high heels look totally effortless, thanks to a casual flick of her sweater over her shoulder.  Brandy’s white loafers at a pre-Grammys party in Beverly Hills featured horse-bit detailing, and her mostly white ensemble showed dedication to a monochromatic color scheme.

			 Pockets a plenty! 
  Cargo pants are back, guys, and it's probably time to accept it. Celebs like Kim Kardashian are wearing them, and they're for sale at all your favorite e-retailers. They really have just one claim to fame, and that's pockets. These pants can hold all the things—or so they'd like you to think! To truly test whether or not this storage situation is all a myth, I decided to forego my purse and carry my sh*t around in cargos all week. Scroll on to see what happened. These are the items I can't live without on a day-to-day basis: my phone, my Kindle, my lip balm, and my wallet, which also carries my keys.    I decided to grab the whole cargo pants thing by the horns on the first day by wearing the pair with the biggest pockets. I chose a style that was trendy and sporty with a cool belt detail in an off-white shade, and wore it with a chunky turtleneck in neutral tones. This outfit was comfy as hell, and I totally recommend it. Things were looking good. That is, until I put stuff in the pockets. While they actually could fit all my items—even the Kindle—it was decidedly weird to have it all hanging out in front of my kneecaps. I eventually took everything out of the front pockets, and put the wallet and lip balm inside the hip compartments, the phone in my jacket, and carried the Kindle in my hands. The takeaway:  These pants are cute, and I love them, but knee pockets should be for aesthetic purposes only—not for practical storage. Day 1 look: Cropped Sweater, COS; White Cargo Pants, ASOS; Neutral Sneakers, Timberland    Once again, I went all-in on the trend, going for a '90s vibe with some camo-print, wide-leg cargos. I paired them with a fuzzy crew-neck sweater and some classic white sneakers. It was A Vibe. Despite the sheer number of zippers (there were four on the front alone) on this pair of pants, there actually weren't a lot of pockets. Once again, I ended up putting my smaller items in the hip compartments, using my jacket, and carrying the Kindle. The takeaway:  Zippers do not necessarily lead to pockets, but these pants were super comfy and fun, so I'm still into 'em. Day 2 look: Boucle Jumper, COS; High-Waisted Cargo Pants, Re/Done (Available at Shopbop); White Classic Sneaker, Reebok   On the third day, I wore a pair of army-green skinny cargo pants with a slit at the hem, paired with a black balloon-sleeve blouse. Though these pants didn't appear to have the pocket real estate that the others did, they actually could accommodate all my sh*t—even the Kindle! It looked a 'lil weird, not gonna lie, but it fit, and wasn't uncomfortable to walk around in. Pocket mission: accomplished. The takeaway: Could fit all my stuff and looked the most like normal (read: not cargo) pants, so four for you, Glen Coco! Day 3 look: Balloon-Sleeve Blouse, H&M; Split-Hem Cargo Jeans, Good American; Sock Booties, ASOS   This time, I went for a khaki pair with a bungee hem and styled it with a yellow puff-sleeve sweater and white kicks. Based on day 3's results, you might think that this pair would also win—because the side pockets seem equally large—but you'd be wrong. The flap openings on the side details here were actually sewn shut at one end, and therefore could not fit my Kindle, though everything else got in there fine. The takeaway: Looks can be deceiving! But I loved the bungee hem on these guys, so they're still cool with me. Day 4 look: Yellow Sweater, H&M; French Military Cargos, Nili Lotan (Available at Shopbop); White Classic Sneaker, Reebok I saved this pair of cargos for last, because they were super soft and it was Friday and I wanted to be comfy. I wore them with a white bodysuit and black sock booties, though, because you still have to look nice at work, right? These guys fit all my stuff except for my Kindle which, at this point, had become standard, and I get it—who's going around carrying their tablet in a regular pocket, anyway?  The takeaway: I cannot stress enough how C-O-M-F-O-R-T-A-B-L-E these pants are. I stan. Day 5 look: White Bodysuit, Uniqlo x Alexander Wang; Soft Cargos, Splendid (Available at Shopbop); Sock Booties, ASOS The idea that cargo pants are convenient because they have so many pockets is, by and large, incorrect (based on my limited, five-day experience, but still). It's also highly impractical to use the lower pockets, because who wants to bend so far down to access your most important items? That said, after this week, I'm down with cargos. All of these pairs were either statement pieces, super similar to any other pant I would naturally wear, or the comfiest trousers I've ever had the pleasure of wearing during the work week. So, rise, cargo pants, RISE.  Photographer: Allie Holloway; Photo Assistant: Brandon Bakus; Hair & Makeup: Glamsquad

			 Something Navy founder Arielle Charnas has just dropped her latest collection from Nordstrom and—guess what—you're going to want to shop. It includes dresses you can wear for work or holiday parties, a white blouse you didn't know you needed (until now!), plus great boots that won't break your budget. Shop my favorites from the bunch, ahead.  Yes, white boots are indeed still going strong. But if they're not your thing, this style also comes in leopard print and classic black.  Pair this with all of your favorite sweaters to add some oomph.   A polished coat you can wear with everything.  When you can't be bothered to wear heels, try a sleek loafer instead.  Wear this number to all the winter weddings you have to go to this season.   Found: The coat you'll find yourself reaching for every weekend.  The option to remove the bow makes it feel like you're getting two shirts for the price of one.  If you don't already own a pair of nice black boots, now is your chance. A party dress with sleeves? Yes please.

			 Take a closer look. Balmain has introduced a new gang of supermodels—but, they're not real. This season, creative director Olivier Rousteing has opted for a "virtual army" of digitally manufactured models to wear his newest collection. "Anyone and everyone is always welcome to join Balmain army's growing ranks — they need only share our bold spirit of adventure as our new virtual icons, Margot, Shudu and Zhi who mirror the beauty, the rock style and the confident power," says  Balmain's official website. The lifelike models were created by photographer Cameron-James Wilson, who famously created Shudu in 2017.  The clothing is "styled" by CLO Virtual Fashion, which creates hyperrealistic, 3D garment simulations.  Shudu is known as the "world's first digital super model." Her Instagram page has almost 140,000 followers, and she's already been featured in editorial shoots for Women's Wear Daily, Vogue Australia and Cosmopolitan.  The popularity of virtual models is definitely on the rise. Lil Miquela, a character created by Trevor McFedries and Sara Decou as a digital art project, has over 1 million followers on Instagram and models high fashion looks, along with promoting multiple charitable organizations to help bring awareness to their causes.  Balmain's Rousteing is known for his edgy style and focus on bringing the French fashion house to the forefront of the digital age.  "We need to change. We need to push boundaries. We need to talk to the new generation. We need to make fashion relevant," he said in a video for the New York Times last year. Earlier this year, Rousteing created "My City of Lights," which is a virtual reality experience and headset to help people understand his creative process. In a promo video for Balmain, he says he wanted to help "bridge the gap between fashion and technology."

			 Twitter did NOT hold back.  On Thursday, Melania Trump flew to McAllen, Texas to visit immigrant children being detained after being separated from their parents. But the Internet was in an uproar over her green hooded Zara jacket, in particular because the phrase "I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?" was printed on the back.  Her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said there was "no hidden message," but President Trump contradicted that statement in a Tweet, writing that the message referred to the "Fake News Media." Her stylist also said he had never seen the jacket before, so there's that. Below, the 12 best reaction Tweets to her parka.  If you don't get this one, please listen to this song ASAP.  The question that all of us want to know.  ZING.  Because that's also a very real thing that happened.  And lastly, the best reaction to this whole trash fire of a mess was the creation of ireallydocare.com, which donates to 14 groups that directly provide aid to immigrants including legal and social services to those in need, among other helpful resources.

			 Cold weather sucks, so distract yourself and buy these cute purses instead.  Fashion month gave way to tons of unique bag styles that you'll be sure to see all over the place once spring 2019 rolls around. Take note of the 11 trends that dominated the runways last September, and shop all the fashionable accessories now.  Designers like Erdem, Burberry, and Gabriela Hearst showcased these babies on the spring '19 runways.  A burgundy hue with a bow detail offsets the inherently utilitarian feel of a necklace purse.  A smooth leather material makes this style look extra sleek; plus, you can opt to wear it as a crossbody.   If you really want everyone to notice that yes, you are in fact wearing a lanyard, a cool snakeskin-printed one in pink definitely does the job.  Designers like Marc Jacobs, Dion Lee, and Adeam had accessories that were quite *loopy.*  Thanks to the keyhole fastenings on this strap, you can loop the handle around your arm any way you like.  The handle on this bag can be easily worn around your wrist, while the woven flap and  wooden bead make the style all the more eye-catching.  A sweet little pouch with interlocking handles ensures this bag stays secure.  At runway shows like Coach 1941, Calvin Klein, and Versace, models toted these tiny weekenders down the catwalk.  Want yours to have something extra? The metal studs on this one give it an edgy spin. A pale blue hue and zipper loops that resemble bows give this style a romantic touch.  Contrasting straps make this bag pop, and the cylindrical shape makes it unique from your other purses.  The models at Sally Lapointe, Christian Cowan, and Mary Katrantzou weren't shy about showing off their belongings on the spring '19 runways.  A geometric-shaped top handle makes for a cool structural look.  Yes, the wooden "Ark" bags are the most popular, but it's more fun and unexpected if you opt for this transparent one.   A bag with a croc-embossed handle and removable pouch is oh-so chic. And if you DO have something you'd like to keep hidden, then the zippered compartment comes in handy.  Designers like Simone Rocha, Victoria Beckham, and Maryam Nassir Zadeh all showcased an updated version of this vintage style. Tinted PVC and an interlocking tortoiseshell strap create the perfect balance of modern and retro.  Channel the decade of disco with a bag that's covered in sparkly chainmail.  Like your grandma's purse, but even more sophisticated in tan leather and gold accents.  Designers like Proenza Schouler, Area, and Emporio Armani sent metallic silver bags down the runways reminiscent of crinkled tinfoil (in the best way).  A gunmetal silver clutch will add a sense of sophistication to any ensemble.  A circular bag in the metallic shade gives off a cool futuristic vibe.   The crinkled silver effect takes the western aesthetic of a saddle bag and makes it more trendy.  Designers like Prada, Calvin Klein, and Emporio Armani went for this bold color on the spring '19 runways and sparked the neon green trend that's still apparent today.  You'll give off an '80s vibe by wearing the vivid hue. Plus, the breathable outside pocket on this tote makes it a little sporty.  If you're a fan of bold logos, opt for a colorful crossbody with a thick canvas strap like this one.  The color is definitely loud so if you want to offset it, opt for a bag that has a minimal design such as this triangular one.  Designers like ALEXACHUNG, Rejina Pyo, and Self-Portrait made those reusable grocery bags actually look fashionable on the catwalk.  A feminine tote with a white and red flowers on it will make your next grocery store trip so stylish, yet it also looks great as a regular purse.

			 Feel free to send this list to someone if they need a hint. Struggling to find the perfect birthday present for the woman in your life? Here, 22 chic and stylish gift ideas she'll be SO obsessed with.  If she has an intense cleansing and moisturizing regimen then she'll appreciate a four-product kit that covers all her bases. (This brand is a fave of Meghan Markle's, FYI.)  If she likes a subtle look when it comes to jewelry, a gold watch with a mesh strap and simple face is totally for her.  If she's not one to make a fuss over birthday presents, the least you could get her is a gorgeous arrangement of her favorite flowers. Plus, this company can ship a bouquet with next- or same-day delivery.  Is she known for her extra fashion choices? Then she'll adore bright yellow block-heel pumps with a woven texture.  Her face will look both literally and figuratively lit when she uses this mirror for makeup application, but it also comes with an amazing added bonus: a built-in speaker.  Is she never one to leave the house without a pair of sunnies? Get her a retro style with tinted lenses and gold accents she'll never want to take off.  A top-rated perfume with floral notes of heliotrope and iris combined with stronger scents of leather and suede strike the perfect balance.  Does she watch Fixer Upper on repeat? Then she'll be excited to spruce up her place with a gold-accented decorative tray.   Snag her a cool pair of light-pink corduroys that she can dress up with chic heels or down with trendy white sneakers. A thermal mug comes in handy more often than you think, especially for coffee or tea drinkers. She'll love to tote this cute one to and from work—and everywhere in between.  Treat her with a timeless and delicate gold locket that also has her initial engraved on the front.  If she always has everything planned out months in advance—get-togethers, weddings, vacations, you name it—then an illustrated wall calendar will keep her busy life in order.  A chic candle that smells like Centifolia roses is one she'll definitely be happy to receive; plus, she can use the elegant vessel for storage after it's used.  She'll get so much use out of an eyeshadow palette that features stunning hues in both matte and shimmery finishes.  If she really likes to pile on all her gold jewelry, then she'll freak over this sophisticated style featuring a sparkly white sapphire.  A sequin slip in a gorge shade of purple will definitely inspire her to make some fun plans ASAP.  A crossbody in a subtle shade of pink that has So! Many! Pockets! will become her new best friend.  If she's the most outgoing person in the room, get her a bright faux-fur coat that totally matches her attitude.  Not entirely sure what to get her? A cute gift box with a candle, chocolate, face mask, and lip mask is a great "treat yourself" present.  Are her makeup brushes and jewelry spread out all over her dresser? Then she'll appreciate a pretty mirror that has a handy tray built in to hold everything. A glowing salt lamp makes for the best lighting situation. This one also has an adjustable knob to set it brighter or darker, depending on what she wants the ambience to be.  A set of matching pajamas that comes with a sprig of flowers and a candle is perfect if she loves a relaxing and cozy day to herself.

			 NO 👏 MORE 👏 CHAFING 👏. Ah, ’tis the season of summer fashion! Women everywhere are wearing their best sundresses and white jeans. But now that we’re ridding our outfits of chunky layers, pretty much all of us know of a couple quirks that can ruin our summer ensembles: panty lines, chafing, and skirts that ride up.  For all those summer fashion woes (and more), let me introduce you to the Smooth Slip Shorts from BESTENA, which are made to be worn under any dress, skirt, and, yes, even jeans.   The shorts come in black and  white, and because they’re made from nylon, they have a smooth and stretchy feel to ’em (similar to your favorite leggings). And even though they stick close to your body, they’re super lightweight and will keep you cool and dry from sweat.  If you’re still not convinced, look at the 156 real customer reviews on Amazon and see why they rank with a 4.3-star rating.  One customer says she loves that they’re “low-rise enough so that they don’t poke out the top of [my] skirt or put pressure on [my] abdomen.” Another says they’re so comfy that she wears them around the house and even sleeps in them. The biggest compliment of all might be that one person said these shorts stopped her skin from chafing. “My life changed once I discovered these slip shorts—no more chafing and no more worrying about strong winds lifting my dress.” They’re only $9, so you really don’t have much to lose. The seller even offers free returns on select sizes and colors in case you pick the wrong one. Plus, they’re available for Prime shipping, so if you need them ASAP, they’ll be at your door in a snap.

			 Apologies in advance to my bank account.  New season, new amazing department store sale courtesy of Nordstrom. The retailer is having its annual spring sale in which items are up to 50 percent off including clothes, accessories, beauty products, and home goods now through April 22. So say bye to all your money in 3, 2, 1… Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Channel the warm weather with an adorable sunshiny eyelet top that’ll look good with all your jeans and shorts.  Just because the temps are getting warmer doesn’t mean you can’t wear boots anymore. Enter: these white-hot ankle boots featuring an easy-to-slip-on elastic back.  A rich orange hue looks good on basically any skin tone; plus, the high neckline is counterbalanced with flirty, eye-catching laces up each side.  A one-piece with ruffled details and a front tie is cute for the beach, but even cuter when worn to the bar with denim shorts.  A delicate gold chain gets cheeky when the pendant is a pair of lips.  Move over cross-body purses. This bold orange design is meant to be worn like a backpack over one shoulder and features handy interior pockets.  Behold: the perfect slide to wear to all those spring picnic plans—and well into the summer—thanks to its black-and-white pattern and casual silhouette.  High-waisted denim shorts are definitely a summer go-to, but if you’re looking to add edge, go for this distressed style.   Nothing says “retro” like a shirt with amazing bell sleeves. Wear this floral-printed top with a pair of brightly colored shorts for a cute look.  Slide into this white pair of denim and you’ll see how versatile the hue is compared to your traditional blue washes. They’ll make your legs feel cooler in the summer and complement all your printed tank tops.  Netted bags were all over Instagram last summer, and this season the style will only become more popular. Get on it with a bright yellow design that you can also use as a grocery bag.  Ditch your classic gold hoops in exchange for these marbled acetate ones that face forward. The deep cobalt blue channels the ocean, and the material is also super lightweight.  Start off the season on a bright note with a canary-yellow striped halter jumpsuit.   Black jeans with a straight fit may look edgy, but add some tiny embroidered daisies to them, and they’re so cute!  The sheer sleeves, ruffled hem, and polka-dot print elevate a simple wrap dress.  Your earrings will become the focal point of any ensemble when you show up in a pair of contemporary shoulder dusters.  Get on the snakeskin train with a chic midi featuring a sexy leg slit and low neckline.  Let’s face it: You’ve obsessed over this bag since it first popped up on your feed. Now you can own it because it’s 30 percent off—you’re welcome.  You can’t go wrong with a simple black swimsuit with a side-tie and ruffled neckline.  A denim mini in this color wash is a classic and will go with all your woven summer sandals.

			 Gift cards are for the weak.  Boyfriends can be SO hard to shop for.

Watch these classics together and then literally scratch them off the list to reveal colorful squares. When you get through them all, it makes a memorable addition to any wall. Something unconventional but cool as hell is this custom New York Times book that features the front page the day you were born followed by every birthday afterward. It’s a unique way to commemorate their day. If he likes wearing jewelry, a woven bracelet like this one will last a verrry long time. It’s also not too flashy, so he can wear it every day. All his wires can be so annoying and get tangled in, like, 0.01 seconds, but a slim leather organizing case makes all his cables easy to store and use. A simple silicone phone case might be just the thing he’s looking for, and this one is super grippy so he (hopefully) won’t drop it. Caffeine wakes him up in the morning, but if he doesn’t have time to drink it at home, he can take a cup on the go with this travel mug that’ll keep it piping hot. Who’s ready for game night?! He’ll love a game of Scrabble that you two can play together or with a group of friends. Plus, this one folds into a book shape so you can easily store it upright on a shelf. He’ll never lose a single AirPod again with this handy woven strap he can wear around his neck that keeps both buds secure. Presents don’t have to be all serious, ya know. This itty-bitty beer ornament is cute and will make any tree more fun.  Great for yoga and any other exercise, it’s durable enough to last you a lifetime and so clever it might actually inspire you to hit the mat. He can wear this shirt at Thanksgiving dinner and throughout winter since it’s cozy and its colors are perfect for the holidays. Hint at some travel plans with an actually useful guidebook that has illustrated maps and tips. Plus, it’ll just look great on his bookshelf. Can’t remember the last time he got a luggage upgrade? A new hard-case carry-on will be much appreciated—even more so if you two have an upcoming trip on the calendar. He’ll look so stylish in a knit hat that completes his winter outfits. This one has more than 8,000 reviews and an almost perfect 5-star rating, so you know he’ll probs love it too. His old blazer might be worn out beyond repair, so get him a fresh navy one. He can make this style casual with a striped tee or elevate it with a collared shirt, so he’ll definitely get use out of it. These are stretchy enough that they’re comfy around the waist, but they’re still appropriate to wear to work. Fall is approaching, so he’ll be all about this burgundy cardigan he can wear over his button-down shirts. It’s also perfect if his office is always cold. If he thinks he’s a Chopped champion in his head, the gift of brand-new cooking supplies will inspire tons of new dishes for both of you to make. An *actually* soft beard is possible thanks to this wash and conditioner set especially formulated for facial hair. It has smoothing argan and jojoba oils for a silky-smooth finish. Is he a morning person? Then he won’t ever want to leave this knit robe with contrast piping. He’ll get a lot of wear outta these thick-soled boots made of suede and leather. Plus, they have not one but TWO shades of brown. If he doesn’t already have one, send him a subtle hint to, you know, be better to the Earth with this sleek bottle. It even has a built-in handle on the cap. Outerwear with textured lining will keep him warm in the cooler months, and the corduroy fabric is super on trend for fall. If he’s all about his ’do, a set with clay pomade, a strong-hold spray, and a fine-tooth comb will give his locks that effortless look but, you know, after putting in some effort. Whether he is a huge baseball fan or loves going to concerts, browse around ASAP to score tix to something he’d definitely want to go to—and you can experience it together. Gourmet chef or no, everyone can get use out of this cool air fryer. Its small size won’t take up a lot of counter space, it heats up fast, it comes in five colors, and you can turn basically anything in a yummy crisp. Bombas socks are seriously life-changing, and no, that’s not even an exaggeration. His arches will be so supported, and the two-stripe design adds a cool retro flair. Packing will be a cinch thanks to this water-resistant bag that’ll hold all his toiletries. He can throw it into any weekender or suitcase without worrying about spills. He can charge all his electronics in one spot with this wooden station that also hides all those pesky cords. If he’s been meaning to get new glasses, then this is as good a time as any to gift him a pair. These acetate ones have a classic rectangular shape, and the best news? You can try them on at home for free before you actually buy. Bling out his dress shirts with a pair of knotted cuff links in gunmetal (these’ll last longer than the fabric ones, FYI). If he’s all about grooming and skincare, he’ll be obsessed with a two-in-one cleanser for both his hair and skin. The eucalyptus and rosemary will make him smell amazing, and it washes away all the dirt and grime to leave him squeaky clean. He might be a guy who loves to cook but just doesn’t have the time. A HelloFresh box delivers all the ingredients for a romantic—and easy-to-make—dinner. Sometimes the best present is convenience, right?! *Price listed is per serving and doesn’t include shipping. He’ll feel so fancy when he uses this luxurious sandalwood-scented shaving set that includes pre-shave oil, aftershave, and a badger brush. A red-and-navy hat with that iconic polo logo will complete his outfits this summer. He can enter the world of virtual reality with a durable yet soft headset. Keep him connected with a versatile charger set featuring a slim, high-speed USB with two universal ports to juice multiple devices at a time. Opt for a stylish but simple 100 percent leather belt featuring a gunmetal buckle and an adjustable fit. A fragrance that smells like sandalwood, leather, and iris will quickly become his new fave to spritz before he leaves the house. Plus, it’s a unisex scent that you can totally spray on yourself when he’s not looking. Consider Mark Dredge’s The Beer Bucket List, which has a thorough list of hops-focused information, including a list of the best drinking spots around the globe. If his wrist is in need of something new, get him a brown leather watch with silver accents and a modern face. A denim shirt is a staple in every guy’s closet, and this chambray material is surprisingly so soft. Is he a guy who stays in his pj’s all morning? He’ll also love a pair of comfortable slippers to wear with them while he’s drinking his coffee. Face wash, soap scrub, shaving cream, and moisturizer are all the grooming essentials he needs if he’s on the go. Treat him (and yourself!) to a gift box featuring modern wine glasses, a gold-accented corkscrew, and, most important, a really good cabernet sauvignon. This soft shoe in a minimalist silhouette makes every walking experience cozy and cool. Toast him with a sophisticated set of whiskey glasses and a matching decanter. It’ll look right at home among his liquor bottles. This speaker might be compact and portable, but it doesn’t skimp on providing a full range of sound. Other pluses? It is water-resistant, has an eight-hour battery life, and comes in three other shades. He’s been complaining about your teeny-tiny television for a while, so if a 50-inch one doesn’t do it, IDK what will. This one has all the apps on it, so you can both watch your Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and HBO shows and more with one click. If he’s dropped hints about getting into photography (or about wanting a new camera), a Nikon one that is small enough for travel but takes amazingly clear pics is totally for him. He won’t look like he’s on his way to third period with a modern style like this. It also happens to be waterproof and has a built-in laptop sleeve. A perfect present for someone outdoorsy and active! He’ll want to ride this black-and-red guy everywhere thanks to its comfy seat and seamless gear changes. Are they musically inclined? Or have they always wanted to learn? This stunning electric guitar not only looks great on display, but he’ll also love to shred those strings. A completely wireless charger for all his compatible devices is the perfect gift if he’s into anything high tech. This can also double as a catchall tray for jewelry and keys. Hook this baby up to your TV or phone for major amplified sound. It even has a voice-controlled Alexa built in.  Doesn’t have a designated liquor space yet? This mirrored cart will fit all his bottles and glasses—and inspire him to host the next get-together with his buddies. A razor that feels like a hot towel is, like, every guy’s dream, right? This one is warm to the touch with every stroke for a super-close and satisfying shave. Treat him with a Nintendo Switch he can use to unwind after a busy day at work. Now you can both play as much Mario Kart as your hearts desire since it comes with two controllers. An experience is arguably the best kind of gift, especially if it involves this incredible patio situation in Greece. Want to go somewhere closer to home? Just browse Airbnb for a luxurious staycation too. He’ll love wearing these Ray-Bans with a stylish metal brow bar to complete his ensembles. The best part? You’ll look great in them too!  Give his wallet an upgrade with a slim black-and-red leather one. It’ll fit into his pocket much more easily than his old bulky case. Set the mood with a fancy candle. With notes of cardamom finished with a woody base, this one can even relieve nerves and anxiety. Extra points for the handblown glass vessel. His music-listening days will be forever changed with a pair of over-the-ear headphones—they’re great to wear while traveling and when working at his desk for crystal-clear sound quality. If he’s the creative type (and you’re in the mood to splurge), opt for a tablet that converts into a laptop for double the options. The stylus makes working on the flat surface that much easier.

			 Work all those family photos, girl.   Congrats, grad! You've worked so hard to make it this far, you might as well finish college in style. Here, 17 dresses that'll help you work that graduation stage.  Ballerina-pink is almost a neutral color, so a dress like this pairs well with any graduation gown and tassel. This one, with its romantic Guipure lace, is also lined to keep it from being completely see-through.  You really can't go wrong with an A-line dress, especially when it has a subtly sexy low back with criss-cross straps and a tie.  A wrap dress can be simple, so if you want to up the ante, go for one that also has pleats and a pretty floral pattern.  Your robe usually hits the lower part of your shin (depending on your height), so go ahead and experiment with a dress featuring a longer hem—like this gorge powder blue one.  Flutter details on the shoulder add drama to a simple pink dress, and since your grad robe is oversized, they won't get crushed in the sleeves.  A blue-and-white flower pattern is perfect for a summer graduation. This style also has breezy slits and arm ties, so your dress will stand out from the rest.  A crochet lace dress is a classic for the big day, but this neckline and fluted sleeves add extra flair.  No matter what color your robe, cap, or tassel is, white is always a great option. A spaghetti-strap dress with a scalloped lace hem is one you can wear all throughout the summer—not just on graduation day. Really want your dress to stand out against your solid-color robe? A bright and elegant pattern will do the trick; plus, the silhouette keeps your shoulders cool. Dove gray complements so many other colors because it's a neutral hue, and the one-shoulder cut adds a feminine touch thanks to the bow detail.  If your graduation isn’t taking place in an air-conditioned building, a dress with eyelet fabric will keep you cool while still looking effortless. This style also has a ruffled hem to make it more dressy.  Sheer fabric, like featured on this lilac babydoll, is definitely more breathable in the sweltering heat. The smocking at the bust also offers stretch and looks super cute at the same time. A playful ruffled dress with contrasting trim will look amazing with your black robe and cap—and even more in all those family photos.  A "V" neckline and waist tie take a dress from basic to effortlessly chic. Pair it with metallic or tan heels to complete the vibrant look.  A number with a square neck and puff sleeves has a slight retro feel but can totally be dressed up or down. If you're someone who doesn't want to drop a ton on a dress you'll wear only once, a white one like this is a great warm-weather staple you'll constantly break out of your closet.  A lacy sheath dress is even more eye-catching when it has ladder stitching that looks like teeny tiny cutouts along the bodice.  *Own* that stage in a figure-hugging mini with open shoulders. A pair of neutral heels will keep the attention on your white-hot ensemble.

			 Channel the snow with these lewks.  Whoever said you can’t wear white after Labor Day has some serious issues. I mean, how does one write off an entire color after a specific holiday?! Thankfully, fashion never plays by the rules—and we don’t either. While warmer-weather trends are filled with color—think neons, tie-dye, and bold hues—you’ll def amp up your chic factor when you wear creams and whites this season. Ahead, 25 cute winter white outfits that’ll make you look effortless when you hit the slush-covered streets.  There’s nothing that makes you look more pulled-together than a slim-fitting turtleneck. Wear it with a denim skirt and neutral knee-high boots for an outfit you can wear both in and out of the office. Just because summer’s over doesn’t mean the tie-dye trend is. This multicolored white slip definitely looks cold-weather-appropriate when worn with an oversize teddy coat and cream combat boots. A shirtdress is a great basic to have in your closet. Yes, even in winter! Put a cream sweater or coat over it to fight off the chill, and add a transparent top-handle to finish off the look. You’ll feel like you’re wrapped in a blanket with this ultra-soft pullover. Pair it with a white midi skirt and neutral accessories for that effortless I-just-threw-this-on outfit. Get a coat and scarf in one with an oversize cape that does wonders for neck warmth. Don’t be afraid to wear it with white denim too! Add a simple belt and colorful cowboy boots for some contrast. A matching set makes getting ready in the morning incredibly easy when you’re short on time, and a knit midi with a coordinating cardigan looks polished. (Pro tip: Invest in a slip skirt if it’s too sheer for ya.) Transition between seasons with a classic white smock minidress that is stylish but oh-so comfortable. Pair it with block-heel sandals on warmer days and cowboy boots when the temp starts to drop. Cargo styles are all the rage this season, and not just as pants! So why not try a more elevated cargo skirt in satin? Coordinate with an equally satiny button-down and a polished crossbody bag. A white chunky knit is SO versatile. Dress it up with a patterned miniskirt, tweed bag, and beret, or go casual with jeans and flats. If you’re hesitant to wear white on white, try a simpler option. An all-white denim ensemble is très chic with minimal risk of getting it wrong. Nothing is more classic than an oversize white shirt—especially if it’s under $50. Wear it with jeans or a knit skirt and lots of layered gold necklaces for a sophisticated ensemble. Forget what you may think of cardigans! There’s a reason this little piece of outerwear has stood the test of time. It’s elegant and effortless, and it keeps you warm when the frigid winter air creeps into your office building. White leather bike shorts? You so didn’t know you needed these until now. Make them the statement by keeping the rest of your ’fit (i.e., a blazer, white tee, and black shoes) minimal. If you’ve been living in boiler suits, then this white corduroy one is a must for your winter shopping list. It’ll look killer with some bold high-heel ankle boots—trust me. Pair this mini with tall boots and tights to wear it into colder months. Throw on a ribbed white long-sleeve shirt and you’ve nailed the whole “winter white” thing. Everyone should own a timeless sweater dress. They’re comfy yet totally refined. Accessorize with lace-up booties and a gold-chain crossbody, and this asymmetrical one is a definite knockout. Trade out your blue denim jacket for a white one this season. You might be surprised how much it’ll refresh your basic, everyday attire—it’s just as versatile. A pair of white wide-leg jeans is a must if you’re into a minimal vibe. They also happen to look great with gold hoops and a beige top. This not-so-basic mini can easily transition from work to play, and the tiered frills set it apart from the rest of your LWDs (that’s Little White Dresses to you). A white sequin coordinating blazer and pant set is practically calling your name for all those upcoming holiday events. An understated flowing white trench goes with everything. Imagine how stylish you’ll look caught in a snow flurry. Wear it with white pants or on its own as a dress. A cropped jacket is a great transitional piece when the weather can’t make up its mind. Pair it with cropped pants and a cute lil top-handle for a fancy touch. A white sweater makes the perfect layering piece, but the added neon detail makes a statement even when worn alone. Tuck it into some high-waisted white jeans for a standout lewk. Be the chicest gal in town in an embroidered midi dress that strikes the perfect balance of elegant and sexy (thanks to the thigh-high slit). Throw on some leather over-the-knee boots when colder weather hits. Travel in style or lounge luxuriously in this coordinating cable-knit lewk. Because once it’s below freezing, you’ll totally want a comfy high-waisted two-piece set.

			 Summer’s not your thing? Here ya go. Before you say anything further, just remember all good things must come to an end. Yes, even that hot girl summer you’ve been having. We go through this every year as September begins to approach and it’s time to start thinking about having to dress in actual layers and worry about what shoes to wear in the snow. Here are 13 winter trends—including checks, snake print, capes, and long-long puffers—that will help ease your anxiety of saying goodbye to summer and get you pumped for those chillier temps. Leather literally everywhere during fashion month! McQueen, Fendi, Gucci, Khaite, and Off-White showed it in a range of colors from all black to vibrant hues.  Off-White You can wear this one as a shirt or jacket—the sky’s the limit. Buttery soft leather trousers to keep you warm. Because you can never have too many black leather bags.  Big color energy’s a thing, right? Well, at least, it was on the runways at Balenciaga, Chanel, Area, and Marc Jacobs.  Balenciaga Think: WWMMD (What Would Meghan Markle Do)? Answer: wear this coat, obviously. Comfy and colorful, just the way winter fashion should be. For those cozy days, wear this blue knit with jeans and your fave sneaks—done! Bruno Mars can dig this trend. Be literal 24-karat magic, not just at night but during the day too, as seen on the runways of Celine, Altuzarra, Michael Kors, and Missoni.  Celine The ’80s are making a comeback, and these pants have your name on ’em. *in your Queen Bey voice* “Shinin’, shinin’, shinin’, shinin’...all of this winnin’, I’ve been losing my mind.” Need I say more about this gold top? For those Saturday morning walks with your pup, when the air is slightly crisp...why blend in when you can stand out? If there were ever a time to switch up your outerwear game, it is now. And the switch is to capes, FYI. Capes had a huge moment on the fall runways this season, seen at Chanel, Celine, Miu Miu, Max Mara, and Marc Jacobs.  Chanel Why go for a regular old trench when you could go for a cape trench? This blue cape is so classic yet so modern. This is just an excuse to walk around in a blanket all day, and I love it. Summer was all about slime green, but when the temp cools down, the color of choice is definitely going to be bright orange. Saint Laurent, Jacquemus, Piscavera, Christian Cowan, and Victor Glemaud showed the shade. Saint Laurent If you must put away swimsuits in favor of knits, at least this one is a happy color. Orange + leather = two fall trends in one! Found your next Netflix and chill lewk. Fendi, Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana, Khaite, and Valentino (and many more) all showed us how this see-through trend is not just for nighttime. (Also: Hi, Bella Hadid!) Fendi Loving everything about the puff sleeves and delicate blush shade in this dress.  Sexy + cool in daytime is allowed, just letting you know. And this shirt will help you out with how to achieve that. Sheer zebra for those who want an alternative to leopard.  Looking for an updated interview look? Try the pussy-bow blouse, as seen at Brock Collection, Celine, Burberry, Christian Dior, and Kate Spade.  Brock Collection A not-so-basic white blouse. Or how about the same idea in a print? In case red’s your color. Here’s a trend Blair Waldorf would probably appreciate: printed tights for extra flair, because why not. Marine Serre, Fendi, Maryam Nassir Zadeh, Rodarte, and Versace showed how to properly execute this look. Marine Serre Delicate florals can keep you warm when the temp chills out this winter.

			 Is this the same person? Ashley Graham is a gorgeous model now with a sexy look and a stylist, but, back in the day, she suffered from the same fad style and beauty trends that we all did. Case in point: This bowl cut she once had. On a recent trip home to Nebraska for her sister's bridal shower, Ashley went through tons of #TBTs on her Instagram stories.  The treasure trove of '90s and early aughts images is really a sight to see, and includes flashbacks to her high school prom with some kid named "Brett" and a truly great pair of glasses. Show of hands: Who else had an updo like this for their first prom? The model also shared photos of herself experimenting with very over-the-top makeup.

			 Sure your horoscope says you'll need a lot of hot looks this season, but our astrologer-and-stylist team found the single best one for getting 👏  what 👏  you 👏  really 👏  want 👏. Holy sh*t, guys—you’re going to have a great fall. There are tons of astrological reasons why (we’ll get to that in a minute, but it has to do with the fact that Jupiter—the luckiest planet—is hanging out in Sagittarius for the rest of the year; plus, a few retrogrades are finally bowing out, thank God).    To capitalize on this momentous time for literally everyone, we put Jake Register of Jake’s Astrology to work with our fashion team to find your luckiest look for your peak fall moment. Aries Taurus Gemini .  Cancer 
 Leo  Virgo Libra Scorpio Sagittarius Capricorn Aquarius  Pisces 
  Pack your bags—it’s time to plan a trip. When Jupiter enters Sagittarius on November 8, it’s all about learning. “Aries’ upcoming year essentially has an extra helping of good luck, and the most growth happens in the area of life regarding travel, education, philosophy, and foreign cultures,” Jake says. Meaning? It’s the perfect time to explore a new place and just let loose.  When you go, you’ll want to make sure you pack your brightest, most effortless clothes.  Consider something with warm colors that accentuate your fire sign vibes, then go for a breezy feel in the spirit of the light, carefree atmosphere of your trip. “Aries wouldn’t want anything too tight-fitting during this time, so keep it loose and flowy and comfortable,” Jake says. “It’s a very relaxed, pleasant recreational time.” Pro tip: Keep your beauty look low-key too. ASOS Red Multi-Color Stripe Sweater, $56; Kenzo Ruffled Slip Midi Dress (Available at Shopbop), $760 BACK TO MENU 
  Your fall starts off rough, but good news: Venus retrograde is over as of November 16, meaning your world—particularly as it pertains to your career—is about to feel way more purpose-driven and orderly. “Tauruses are very business-minded, but work’s a little funky for them in the fall,” Jake says. “As soon as this retrograde lifts, they’ll feel refreshed and able to conquer—get back at it.”   To coordinate with your grab-your-career-by-the-reins moment, you need a killer outfit for your next big meeting. “Tauruses don’t have a lot of drama—they’re cut and dry, matter of fact, and that goes all the way to their wardrobe choices,” Jake says. “This time around, though, I think they’d experiment with something that has sharp lines and some architectural flair that’s trendy but still reads office-appropriate.” Consider a neutral jumpsuit, like this one, paired with a striped blouse and mustard turtleneck. These earthy colors pay tribute to your element.   As for your beauty situation, keep it natural: A bold brow and fresh face will work to accentuate this look without taking away from it.  H&M Jumpsuit, $80; H&M Cashmere-Blend Turtleneck, $70; Vivetta Striped Shirt, Price Upon Request;  H&M Loafers, $70; Socks, Stylist’s Own BACK TO MENU As soon as Jupiter enters Sagittarius on November 8, it’s time to focus on your friendships, because your whole crew is feeling closer and more intimate than ever. “For a bit longer than a year, Jupiter, associated with good fortune and expansion, enters the relationships sector of Gemini’s chart,” Jake says. “The next year of Gemini’s life will see a lot of strong friendships being formed and serious relationships established.” Translation: Y’all need to schedule a girls’ night out for as soon as possible after this astrological event.   As for your outfit? “You’ll want to wear something with movement, because Geminis are very flexible,” Jake says. “It needs to have not too much going on but a lot going on at the same time—that’s what Geminis are all about.” Try a lacy top with a pair of coordinating wide-leg pants in yellow, the traditional color of the air sign, which makes you stand out from the crowd. Don’t be afraid of accessories, either. “Geminis love to accessorize and really pile it on,” he adds, and this the night for it.    Beauty-wise, think romantic, with a smudge of brown on your lids and a glossy lip.  For Love and Lemons Tati Lace Ruffle Dress (Available at Shopbop), $273; Rachel Comey Clean Bishop Pants (Available at Shopbop), $345; Mona Sultan Honey and White Polka-Dot Large Neckerchief, $85; Norma Kamali Gloves (Available at What Goes Around Comes Around), Price Upon Request; Aquatalia Suede Ankle Boots, $395 BACK TO MENU Girl, you are in for the chillest fall of your life. In astrology, there are these things called trines, which basically means three planets or other horoscope points are aligned in a triangle, creating harmony. In general, they are going to make you feel like everything is just as it should be in all your relationships—look out for November 6, when the sun is in Scorpio and it trines with Neptune, and December 21, the last day of fall, when Venus is in Scorpio and it trines with Neptune. “These trine moments hone in on Cancer’s relationships and love life, and it’s a great way for them to end the year on a high note, feeling remarkably strong connections to others and lots of emotional satisfaction,” Jake says.   Capitalize on these two days by getting all hygge with your best buds, and either have a wine night in your apartment or grab a low-key coffee around the corner. “Wear something you can get cozy in—but not too comfortable! We don’t want you in a Snuggie or anything,” Jake says. Get yourself an oversize duster sweater you can wear as a dress, and cinch it with a belt bag, topping off the style with a pair of sock booties. Bonus points if your ensemble follows the moody ocean blues associated with your water sign.    Although your aesthetic may be casual, feel free to go all-out with your makeup—consider, for instance, a navy winged liner.  N. Peal Herringbone Cashmere Cardigan, $1,250; Eloquii Belt Bag, $50; Jennifer Fisher Crystal Earrings, $725; Jennifer Fisher Palm Ring, $250; Necklaces, Model’s Own  BACK TO MENU When Jupiter enters Sagittarius on November 8, according to Jake, it’s in the part of your zodiac sign’s chart that has to do with love, romance, and sex, so let’s just say you’re going to want to get. it. on.    So it goes without saying you'll need a killer date-night outfit. Because you’re a Leo, that means something daring, bold, and show-stopping. “Leos like to grab the spotlight—like, she’s going on a date with one person, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t want all eyes on her,” says Jake. “She’ll wear something sexy—and definitely leather.” Think about sporting a black skirt with flirty cutouts. A bright red top will put the emphasis on your fire sign, as will “look at me!” statement patterns like houndstooth and angled stripes.    In the beauty department, don’t be afraid to go bold—try emphasizing your lip liner.  Self-Portrait Satin Eyelet Tie-Sleeve Top, $293; Self-Portrait Black Faux-Leather Wrap Skirt, $282; Miaou Herringbone Jacket, Price Upon Request; H&M Red Tassel Earring, $10 BACK TO MENU “Mars is the planet of passion and energy. When it enters Pisces—the opposite sign of Virgo—on November 15, it brings its fiery touch to Virgo’s relationships,” Jake says, hinting that it’s a great time to spark a bond with a totally new pal.  What better way to do that than to head to a concert together? One night, tons of memories, and a solidified friendship? Yes, please!   Going to a concert means mastering the art of looking chic without trying too hard, something Virgo nails every time. “Virgos aren’t in your face like a Leo or Aries, but she’s still going out and wants to make a splash,” Jake says. “She’ll probably do it by layering some more oversize pieces over sexier, tighter clothes.” With that in mind, take a little risk in a shiny pair of lace-up leggings in a deep teal, a nod to your earth element. That, plus a vintage rocker tee, snakeskin booties, and an oversize jean jacket with funky waxed details are perfect for you.   Don’t overthink your hair and makeup. Instead, go with the flow in a messy low pony with S-waves, face-framing pieces, and a shimmery eye.  MISBHV Denim Jacket, $298; Rolling Stones T-Shirt (Available at What Goes Around Comes Around), $500; Unravel Blue Viscose Laced Up Skinny Pants, $1,111; Aldo Snakeskin Boot, $100; Jennifer Fisher Mini Drew Hoops, $265; Bonheur Jewelry Sterling Silver Collar, $375 BACK TO MENU Libra season goes from September 22 through October 23. That’s when the sun, the brightest part of the Zodiac, is in Libra, and it is all about you. In particular, it’s all about your love life, so it’s time to get flirty. “In general, Libra season is pleasant, light-hearted, social, and romantic,” Jake says.  “There’s a reason this time of year is called ‘cuffing season,’ and that’s because of all the Libra energy in the air!”   So let’s get you a baller date-night lewk, shall we? “Libras are a little bit extra, but not as extra as Leos—they’ll want to look super glam for this date,” Jake says. “As far as what they should wear, definitely something that has a slit, which conveys how open they are to love.” A maxi dress in your air colors would work great: think blues, purples, whites, and light grays. Top off the style with an unexpected matching leather trench and neutral sock booties, and you’ve got yourself a bangin’ fashion aesthetic.    On your face, create a fresh look with blush. For hair, big roller curls will add a vampy, retro vibe.  MISBHV FANTASY Leather Trench Coat, Price Upon Request; Zara Knit Mock Dress, $70; Jennifer Fisher Quad Hoops, $395; Aldo Adwadia Boots, $110 BACK TO MENU Scorpio season—a.k.a. when the sun is all up in your zodiac sign—is from October 23 to November 22, and “it’s a time when you’ll feel confident, refreshed, and able to accomplish work,” Jake says. Take that get-sh*t-done attitude, apply it to your job, and just generally kick ass, OK? And dress to kill if you have an interview or a big presentation coming up.   “This look should be powerful. Scorpios aren’t afraid to wear colors that stand out and catch your eye—reds, purples, blacks,” says Jake. Try a body-hugging sweater dress in fuchsia—with striking patterns befitting your intense, work-hard vibes. Even better if your piece has a cool texture, like fringe, to make it stand out.    Since there’s a lot going on fashion-wise, it’s OK to tone down your makeup, but keep it fun  with a lip that matches the hues of your outfit.  Prabal Gurung Knit Dress, Price Upon Request; Anita Berisha Femme Earrings, $90 BACK TO MENU Sure, everyone else is going have a great fall, but you’re going to have, like, the best. fall. ever. That’s because that lucky Jupiter planet is in your sign, which means you stand to benefit the most. “This is the luckiest planet in the luckiest sign,” Jake says. “It’s going to be a time where you feel great and way luckier than normal.” When that happens (November 8, BTW), take off work, and just live your best life: Start with a major brunch, go shopping, explore your city—it’s going to be a good day.    So…what kind of outfit is worthy of this special, special time for you? “Sagittariuses are really loud and proud, so a bold color, like orange—which is even better because that’s a Jupiter color—would be perfect here,” Jake says. A look-at-me jumpsuit in a flowy silk will do just the trick. Wear a cute thin knit underneath, and you’ve got a comfy, cozy, show-stopping situation going on.    As for your makeup, get your peachiest blush on, mimic it for your eyes, then create your best version of sexy bedhead hair.  A Peace Treaty Marigold Jumpsuit, Price Upon Request; Orange Top, Stylist’s Own; Dinosaur Designs River Rock 2 Drop Earrings, $220 BACK TO MENU Hear me out: You may not be a Libra, but Libra season (September 22 through October 23) affects your sign, making you super confident in your career and in your general atmosphere at work, according to Jake. “When the sun is in Libra, it’s a significant point in time for Capricorns, because it lights up the part of their chart known as the ‘midheaven’ or the ‘tenth house,’ which is the highest point on an astrology chart,” says Jake. “When there’s action in a chart’s midheaven, it’s a time where the sign is fully in the spotlight, all your hard work and achievements of the past year are on display…it’s a time of recognition and praise from colleagues,” he says. So why not accept those compliments in an updated work wardrobe?   As an Earth sign, think about pieces that incorporate silver, metallic, grays, and other earthy tones, like deep green, when you’re upgrading to a trendier aesthetic. A cool, glittery dress with an architectural sleeve could work great, especially when toned down and layered beneath a more approachable shirtdress. If the style is pinstriped, more power to you, according to Jake: “Pinstripes are important to a Capricorn, because they’re structured and organized, and this sign is all about things falling in line.” Pair with coordinating ankle booties and a geometric bag, and you’ll be getting compliments on your wardrobe as well as on your work ethic.    As for beauty, be true to your natural self, and rock a fresh face with emphasized brows and freckles.  & Other Stories Striped A-Line Dress, $95, BCBGMAXAZRIA Silver Techno Knit Sweater Dress, $358; Jennifer Fisher Convertible Globe Duster, $400; Jennifer Fisher Palm Ring, $250, Jennifer Fisher Male Ring, $295; Loeffler Randall Indy Circle Crossbody Bag (Available at Shopbop), $375; Aquatalia White Ankle Boots, $475  BACK TO MENU Libra season, which is September 22 through October 23, also has great effects on Aquariuses. For you, that translates to traveling and learning about other cultures, so take a break from the daily grind, and go on a road trip with your best friend. “This is more the kind of trip where you’re not relaxing, you’re involved, exploring cities—it’s a busy feeling,” says Jake.   Jake adds that Aquariuses are “the sign of the zodiac that’s most eccentric, most different, and that factors into their wardrobe too. They’re a bit boho and hippie with a hint of edge.” Don’t be afraid to showcase that aspect of your style while hitting the road. Think: comfy, eye-catching pieces in blues, grays and whites, which will honor your air-sign vibes. Why not wear a pair of roomy wide-leg trousers with a netted top accented with jewels? Top with a pale-blue trench and a cool cap to bring it all together.    For makeup, get a little quirky, and express yourself. Don't be afraid to take risks with geometric liner—or even a different shadow color for each eye.  Lou De Betoly Embellished Top, Price Upon Request; Topshop Plisse Robe Duster Coat, $110; Acne Studios Pants, Stylist’s Own; Shoes, Model’s Own; Eugenia Kim Hat, $275; Jennifer Fisher Palm Earrings, $575 BACK TO MENU Not going to lie, fall is going to be an emotional time for you, Pisces. For starters, from November 15 until the new year, Mars is hanging out in your sign. And Neptune makes a cameo on December 7, creating a very heightened, passionate trio. “Neptune is Pisces’ ruling planet, so any action happening to Neptune is felt by Pisces…Neptune is dreamy, intuitive, psychic, and passionate—in conjunction with Mars, it’s also energetic, fiery, and explosive,” Jake says. In other words: Hold tight, because December 7 is going to be a wild ride. But if you spend it with people you love, you just might get even closer to them, bonding like you’ve never been able to before. “Mars will be powering up Neptune’s empathetic properties, so having a crazy in-depth heart-to-heart conversation with your girls is likely.” Use this force for good, and have a GNO with your best friends—all while dressing to impress.   Pay tribute to Neptune and to your watery roots by wearing deep, sea-green colors, like teal and dark blue, and something roomy on the bottom, like a harem pant or culottes. “With Neptune being dreamy, a looser, flowy trouser is definitely the way to go,” says Jake. Since this is a girls’ night, though, def get your sexy on in a tighter crop top, which you can wear beneath a bold, patterned overcoat.    Have fun with your makeup look, paying tribute to your sign with an ombré eye that mimics the oil-slick vibes of metallic fish scales.

			 This adorable collection just screams southern charm.  Reese Witherspoon debuted her clothing line Draper James in 2015, and on Tuesday, she brought her colorful aesthetic to the size-inclusive brand Eloquii. The Draper James and Eloquii collaboration features 30 pieces, including gingham shirts, bright spring dresses, and ruffled skirts, in sizes 12 through 28. Witherspoon created two limited-edition collections with the brand that make up the entire 30-piece line: One named "Escape Route," which has a preppy vibe featuring gingham, bows, and stripes, and the other inspired by the West Coast with its tropical and floral patterns. The new Draper James items are available now at Eloquii, Rent the Runway, and DraperJames.com.  "The great part about working with Eloquii is that they’ve already done so much work with their customers. They know what the fits are. They know what their customers like. So it was fantastic to be able to listen to the feedback they already had and design into those ideas," Witherspoon said in an interview with Glamour.  In the same interview she called the lack of inclusion of different body types "ridiculous" and that she likes clothing to have a sense of fun.  "My mother and my girlfriends and I are telling jokes and laughing all day long," she said. "That’s what we try to capture in the clothes."   With its preppy vibes and bold colors, the new collection will make you wish that warm weather would get here sooner. And, as if you weren't excited enough from all adorable size-inclusive options, a second Draper James collab is already in the works and is dropping this spring, according to Eloquii.

			 Because the busty struggle is real. Pretty much every ~busty~ woman would tell you that getting dressed is just a little harder when your cups overfloweth. Cleavage can get way out of control, shirts can gape between buttons, and finding dresses that fit both your top and bottom half is like, forget it! But that doesn't mean they need to ever skimp on style. We surveyed real women with big boobs about their favorite kinds of outfits—here's what they said.

			 Nooooo!!! 😩  Forever 21 is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy as sales decline, sources with knowledge of the plans have told Bloomberg and CNBC. The fast-fashion retailer was already negotiating additional financing options and working with advisers to restructure the company’s debt, but those discussions have stalled, according to Bloomberg.    Weeks ago, the outlet reported that Forever 21—which makes an estimated $3 billion per year in sales—was struggling to pay vendors and landlords and was seeking out ways to “revive its business.” By filing for bankruptcy, the brand may be able to “shed unprofitable stores and recapitalize the business,” Bloomberg reports, citing anonymous sources familiar with the negotiations.    WEAR NOW & LATER | stock up on outfit staples to transition into the new season 🍂 -- Search: 00369001 (tap to shop) A post shared by  forever21 (@forever21) on Aug 21, 2019 at 5:23pm PDT  At the time of writing, Forever 21 has not announced any plans to close any of its more than 800 locations across the U.S. However, as CNBC points out, many of its branches are located in malls, which are seeing fewer shoppers. Similar fast-fashion brick-and-mortars are also fighting (and, at times, failing) to keep up with online and/or direct-to-consumer brands. The UK-based brand TopShop, for example, also recently filed for bankruptcy and closed all of its U.S. stores as a result.   The L.A. Times also projected that Forever 21 lost its “cool factor” and widened its range of merchandise too broadly. “They’ve lost sight of what brought them there,” Roger Beahm, executive director of the Center for Retail Innovation at Wake Forest University, told the paper in July.

			 Petition to bring back Britney’s bright-orange feathered hat, please.  The Billboard Music Awards are coming up again on May 1, but in the meantime, let’s rewind and look at all the delightfully outrageous and completely extra outfits from past red carpets. From Diana Ross’s *very* voluminous ruffled dress to Britney’s questionable (but incredible) feathered hat, here are 28 OTT fashion moments from the BBMAs.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! The “thank u, next” singer gave us all a lesson in lampshading when she wore this poof of a babydoll dress with thigh-high platform boots while performing at the Billboard awards.  Where do we even begin with Lil Pump’s look? There’s the studded jacket sans shirt, the ripped jeans, the Gucci belt and Supreme underwear logo combo, and the *very* sparkly bling.  Also that same year? Tyra’s seemingly Victorian-era-inspired dress with its high neck and extremely ruffled sleeves.  The singer wore this beige getup consisting of an underwire bralette, a trench-coat-esque belted skirt, and over-the-knee lace-up heels that wouldn’t look this good on anyone else.  Vanessa hosted the awards along with Ludacris this year, and one of her many ensembles of the night included this sequin two-piece (that showed off her belly button piercing) and matching headdress.  Ciara was straight-up glowing on the red carpet in this slinky metallic dress that was basically one big side cutout. But dang did she look good.   Have you ever heard of Z LaLa? Apparently, she can sing in 21 different languages (including sign language!) and knows how to rock a showstopping dress. For the 2016 awards, she wore this insanely intricate black gown with a matching headpiece.  Zendaya wore this three-piece suit featuring, like, three different types of animal prints and beaded embellishments, then finished it off with aqua earrings and pumps. So 2015, right?  #TBT to Miley’s pixie cut—and also this jaw-dropping embellished jumpsuit she wore to the 2013 BBMAs.  The same year, Sel donned perhaps one of her riskiest looks: a white gown with a sexy mesh insert, a thigh-high slit, and neon accent colors.  The iconic pop star loves herself a lingerie-inspired ensemble. Case in point? This fishnet, garter, and sheer stocking situation with an extra dose of chains.  Bey hit the stage wearing the strappiest bodysuit you’ve ever seen with a chain-fringe hem for her viral 2011 performance of “Run the World (Girls).” The same year, Kesha wore this cutout dress with a tulle train for extra volume.   Ah, yes, none other than the “Pink Friday” era of Nicki, when her hair was literally hot pink. She contrasted her bright locks with a baby-blue jumpsuit featuring a lotta straps, sequins, and sheer panels.  Brit made quite the splash on the red carpet in this orange duster coat with pink lace trim, matching hot pants, fishnet tights, a rhinestone choker, and a feathered hat. 2010 was like a whole different time, people.  Janet’s twist on menswear was this 2006 outfit, which included pinstripes, a collar, a necktie, and even coordinating wrist cuffs. There’s really a LOT going on here.  The actor, singer, and host went crazy with color when he wore multicolor argyle shorts, a bright yellow sweater, and a patterned tie on the red carpet. (Side note: His show, Wild ’N Out, also premiered this year, can you believe?!)  The icon donned this OTT ruffled dress while performing at the 2004 awards. I guess now we know where her daughter Tracee Ellis Ross gets her affinity for major lewks.  Black Eyed Peas fans, where ya at?! Here, Fergie wore a vacation-print slip dress, a furry shawl, a bright-orange shoulder bag, and red pointy-toe heels to the BBMAs.  The Canadian singer pulled out all the stops with this sexy draped halter dress featuring rhinestone embellishments.   Cher’s fashion choices are almost always extra, but this BBMAs look stands out in particular because just look at all the beads?! Also, she gets extra props because of her matching necklace and feathers.  Back when Gwen was in No Doubt, she was a huge fan of the bra-with-pants look and even wore it at the awards with a cropped jacket, pearls, and her signature red lip.  Kelly Rowland, Beyoncé, and Michelle Williams always knew how to show TF up to an important event—and in coordinating outfits, no less. Michelle sported a denim skirt with neon green accessories (omg, that beret!), Bey wore a strapless dress with pink heels, and Kelly went for a polka-dot ensemble with slouchy boots.  The singer was decked out in a sheer dress with hundred-dollar bills printed on it (her boots and purse had the same print) and multicolor hair. Truly an inspiration.  The “Genie in a Bottle” hitmaker pulled up to the red carpet in a midriff-baring “Las Vegas” shirt, a bright pink maxiskirt, and crimped hair. It was the ’90s, after all, so can you blame her?  Usher—aka your fave artist to get down to in the clurb—wore this incredible all-yellow outfit with a sparkly chain to the BBMAs, where he picked up three awards, including top R&B artist.  All your spicy gals hit the awards wearing outfits that totally fit their monikers (I mean, what could be more Sporty Spice than wearing sneakers?). The group picked up two awards for Top New Artist and Top Billboard 200 Album.  The iconic girl group wore matching outfits featuring plenty of denim, neon colors, and combat boots.

			 Talk about tone deaf. So get this: Imagine you’re a supercute and fashionable woman who is plus-size and you just got paid and want to treat yourself to some brand-new clothes. That’s right, treat yo’ self! Wanting to get the best bang for your buck, you swipe alllll the best deals at Forever 21. The clothing arrives a week later, only for you to find that in your order, the company included a sample of an Atkins diet snack bar. As in...the low-carb diet and weight-loss program. Naturally, your first thought is gonna be, Seriously, WTF? Believe it or not, but this exact scenario happened to a bunch of women, including plus-size shoppers, this past week who recently ordered clothes from Forever 21’s website—which in 2019, makes absolutely no goddamn sense since the average woman is a size 16! Plus-size shoppers who ordered clothes from the brand and got Atkins were pissed TF off and took to Twitter to express why getting the bars felt rude and to question whether non-plus-size shoppers got them too.  I went from a size 24 to 18, still a plus size girl, so I ordered jeans from @Forever21 Opened the package, when I looked inside I see this Atkins bar. What are you trying to Tell me Forever 21, I’m FAT, LOSE WEIGHT? do you give these to NON-PLUS SIZE WOMEN as well? pic.twitter.com/ds8kUTs7T7 my mom ordered some clothes from @Forever21  ‘s plus size collection and they sent a Atkins diet bar along with the stuff she ordered💀 pic.twitter.com/Lxi6XnuOB1 @Forever21 #F21xMe Wish this could have been a pic of me in my #Plussize swimsuits. But no. Its a pic of what jerks you guys are. An Adkins diet bar in my order is NOT COOL pic.twitter.com/64IQMIKrVd tw// eating disorders; body issueshi @Forever21 fuck you for adding dieting bars into your plus size online orders. as someone who struggles with eating disorders this is so disgusting, triggering, and downright degrading !!!! literally fuck this corporation !!!!! Apparently @Forever21 sends out Atkins bars with all of its orders, which sends a wildly dangerous message to ALL of its customers. Not only is it fatshaming, it could also trigger people of all sizes who have EDs. This is as dangerous as it is inappropriate. https://t.co/gPfr3jMUK4 bought a swimsuit online from forever 21 and they sent me an atkins bar along with it lmaoo thank u for reminding me that i don't have a beach ready bod Um, yikes. To do some damage control, Forever 21 has since issued an apology to the customers who received the diet bars, clarifying that they weren’t sent to just plus-size customers and basically admitting that sending them out in the first place was a bad call.   Atkins, on the other hand, took a different approach in their official statement on the matter. Maybe next time Forever 21 can send a clothing coupon in its orders? IDK, just a suggestion.

			 It's time to banish those chokers and fanny packs to the back of your closet (and don't even think about busting out the floral print). For the past few summers, it felt like the same tired trends kept resurfacing: Crop tops. Mules. More damn floral prints. It's boring enough to make even a lapsed fashion disciple want to  seek solace in central air conditioning until September brings its harvest of crisp button-downs and chunky cable-knits. No more. This season, step out of your comfort zone by making a few quick upgrades to your summer wardrobe. You can be as minimal or as extra as you'd like: Layer a few delicate gold necklaces, or go all-out in sweet cherry print from head to toe. Try one, try them all — you do you. 
  Chokers really hit the fashion scene when they regained popularity around 2016 and have been a jewelry staple ever since. Although they're still everywhere this summer, think about going the opposite route by layering with long pendant necklaces.  The style has been spotted on celebs and influencers like Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Baldwin, Aimee Song, and more. Try layering dainty gold chains for an effortlessly chic look.   Gorgeous Gold Necklaces Absolutely Perfect for Layering Summer is usually the time to break out all your floral clothes, but because the print is basically unavoidable during warmer months, it can get boring fast. If you want to wear a fun pattern, but have WAY too many florals taking up precious real estate in your closet, consider the equally cheerful cherry print.  The fruit adds a little '90s nostalgia to any outfit, and it's a fresh way to spruce up your summer wardrobe.  Get Out of Your Floral Rut With These Cherry-Printed Clothes  Once the source of ridicule for tourists and dads everywhere, fanny packs have become cool again, largely thanks to the music-festival scene. But if you're still not convinced of the trend, or simply want to sport a new accessory this season, try a straw bag.   Whether you opt for a beachy tote or a woven crossbody, this summer it's all about the textured material.  These Straw Bags Will Inspire Your Next Beach Vacation  Each summer, as the weather gets hotter, shirts get shorter — and, without fail, crop tops come back with a vengeance. However, if you're looking to stand out in the sea of midriffs this season, consider going even shorter. Enter: the bra top.  You may have seen a Kardashian-Jenner or two wear this ultra-cropped trend, but the statement-making style is totally achievable for everyone. Try it with a pair of super high-waisted shorts or matching pants.  Shop Bras You Can Wear as Shirts  Like chokers, mules are another '90s trend that recently have returned to the fashion forefront. It's impossible not to spot the peep-toe versions on a hot, crowded sidewalk in the middle of summer.  But if you're in need of a footwear refresh, go in the opposite direction and opt for a pair of thick-soled sneakers. And yes, these are totally a summer shoe! Think about all the walking around outside you do this time of year. Beloved by celebs (looking at you, Bella Hadid) and street-style stars alike, clunky-looking trainers are trending, and you'll be so happy to wear something other than those worn-out peep-toe mules.  These Thick-Soled Sneakers Will Become Your Go-To Summer Shoes And there you have it. Your closet — totally refreshed for summer.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Cuffing szn is upon us! Dressing fashionably in the winter can be a huge challenge, but dressing for a date during the season is on a whole new level. Trying to look cute while also staying warm don’t always go hand in hand, and in the dead of winter it’s hard to find motivation to do anything other than bundle up in your sweats and watch rom-coms on repeat. (Just me?) In any case, if you’re going on a date—whether it’s a first date or you’ve been together for years—here are outfit ideas for any occasion, so you can dress to impress. Get ready to ~vibe~ with your potential new S.O. or wow them if you’re already in a relationship, with these 20 winter date outfits.  Nothing says winter date night like a pair of knee-high boots! Pair them with a corduroy dress and a cozy sweater underneath to hit the streets and have a fun day out in your favorite part of town.  If it’s a fancier occasion like dinner and drinks, a mock-neck bodycon with ribbed texture will make you feel confident for the night ahead. Throw on a stylish faux-fur coat and lucite heels to dress it up even further.  Sometimes watching a flick is a great way to connect, especially if you two are movie buffs. Keep it simple but still fashionable in a puff-sleeve sweater and medium-rise jeans, then after the film you can put on your moto jacket to head outside and discuss your hot takes.  Arcades aren’t just for kids, ya know. Go to a local one and grab a beer in a leopard-print knit dress and high-top Converse for a game night filled with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong.  A fuzzy sweater, maxi skirt, and brown boots looks surprisingly effortless, which is great for a low-stakes date like walking around a farmers market. If you end up hitting it off, you can grab some food and take the conversation to a second location.  Through your online chats you both figured out that you love a good read, so a cozy bookstore with a cafe inside and some nooks for chatting is the perf location. A polka-dot tie-neck blouse with a burgundy top handle and ankle boots is a great ’fit to impress your date.  A mini skirt is always a classic, and you can always throw on a pair of tights for more warmth. Coordinate with a slouchy black sweater and black zip-up boots for an edgy winter ’fit. The skirt will also match that glass of Cabernet you're sippin’ on with your date.  PSA: You don’t have to put your dresses away when it’s cold. A knit turtleneck one keeps the cozy vibes going when the temps drop, and it looks great with cream-colored socks and matching booties. The low heels will save your feet when you’re walking around and chatting for hours on end.  A ruffled shirt is flirty, while the black jeans tone it down a bit. When it’s dark at the concert venue, the metallic details will still stand out, and you’ll definitely turn heads with a pair of statement earrings too. Want to wear something more unique? Opt for a pair of corduroy overalls with a flared leg to really make an impression on (and off!) the ice. Wear a black long-sleeve underneath and put on a pair of snakeskin-printed boots for a trendy yet subtle ensemble.  The best part about long dresses is that they can be a part of your wardrobe all year round. Pair this floral one with a black coat and Chelsea boots, and you’ll be comfortable but cute for any travel plans.  You might think a sweater isn’t dressy enough for a date, but you’ll be polished and subtly sexy wearing a hot-pink V-neck cardigan as a shirt. High-waisted black jeans and hoops make it more casual, because you don’t wanna look like you tried TOO hard, right?  Just because it’s cold outside doesn’t mean you have to put away all your LBDs, so get ready for a night out with this sparkly, one-shoulder dress. If you’re meeting up for cocktails at an upscale bar, a martini glass makes a great accessory to this number.  A velvet jumpsuit is perfect for a dinner date after office hours. You won’t seem overdressed, and there’s no need to worry about bringing extra clothes to work. Just pair this with some silver kitten-heel boots and you can hit the town!   A sheer pussy-bow shirt adds a little somthin’ to a classic, all-black winter outfit, and it happens to look killer with belted faux-leather pants. (The roomy sleeves also give you some extra air flow if you're feelin’ nervous and sweaty.)  When temps are literally freezing, opt for a warm peacoat in this gorge lavender shade. Make it the statement piece by keeping the rest of your outfit neutral with a light grey sweater and winter white jeans. (Go with a longer pair and some socks if you need more ankle coverage from the elements.)   An off-the-shoulder sweater is the perfect way to show off some skin in the dead of winter, while still keeping warm. Throw on a scarf and coat, and accessorize with black boots, to stroll through a park with your date.  Faux-leather pants are definitely more edgy than a regular ol’ pair of jeans, and they look amazing with a velvet turtleneck and PVC heels.  Okay, so you’ve settled on a cute cafe to grab a latte one morning and see if there are sparks IRL, but what do you wear? Since it’s super casual, a short puffer over a hoodie will do just the trick. Complete it with jeans, sneakers, and a crossbody for that off-duty model look; plus, dressing down a bit takes the pressure off.  It’s the most classic winter shirt of all time, but a simple turtleneck is transformed with a fun, dotted pattern. If you’re hitting up an art show, gallery, or museum, you’ll definitely match the vibe. Complete it with jeans, a longline coat, and loafers for an elegant ensemble.

			 Three women use it IRL to try out the varsity trend. Imagine this: It’s a regular hectic workday morning. You walk to your closet and effortlessly pull out an outfit that's a perfect representation of your mood and what you have to face for the day. You slip it on, and when you look in the mirror, it is everything.  Then you walk into work and realize you’re naked. Kidding! (Seriously, JK. This isn’t a naked-at-work nightmare.) Whipping together a super easy outfit can actually be a reality thanks to your new digital personal stylist also known as Macy’s The Edit. It's a website showcasing of-the-moment trends and allowing you to easily shop outfits that feel cohesive, on point, and, most importantly, 100% personalized for you.  Here, three unique (slash amazing) women share how they harnessed the power of The Edit to put together varsity-inspired looks they love. “I'm infinitely more confident in general when I feel like I look good. Isn't everyone? ” “On any given day, I’m meeting with executives, attending events, and doing press — I always have to be ‘on’! Plus, I have about zero seconds to get ready in the morning and less than that to actually shop, so I need all the help I can get. I'm infinitely more confident in general when I feel like I look good. Doesn’t everyone? Sometimes a great outfit is the little boost I need to feel like I can tackle whatever I need to tackle that day. With The Edit, having everything already curated and ready to go makes life so much easier. Especially right now — fall is the best time to be a human wearing clothes, is it not? It feels like a fresh start and a way to put a new foot forward, and there’s so much to play with — textures, layering, accessories — that the dog days of summer don’t allow for.  Like a lot of women, I’m more intentional about planning my fall look than any other time of year, so strong pieces I can build a wardrobe around are key. I loved dressing up in this chic varsity trend. Part of what’s fun about fall fashion is that it reminds of you of the start of a new school year. I was a total geek for school, so it was always an exciting time — the varsity trend is a fun way to lean into that.” On Jessica: Tommy Hilfiger Logo T-Shirt, $40, macys.com; Rachel Roy Skirt; Aldo Chelly Platform Sandals in Silver, shop similar at  macys.com; Anne Klein Watch, $59, macys.com. "I like the varsity trend because I love a good uniform." “I’m an actor, so my appearance is important — really important. I walk into a room and have anywhere from one to ten people on the opposite wall asking themselves, ‘Do we buy her as _____?,” and before I even open my mouth, they’re already leaning heavily in one direction. I have to be hyper aware of how I present myself, knowing that it will make up the majority of the impression I leave, and I need to give them as little reason to say ‘No’ as possible. The Edit shows me the trends visually, which helps me figure out what I might like to try next to keep my closet evolving. And because it mixes a whole spread of brands, the styling is more eclectic than what I’ll find on a brand’s e-comm site. It feels creative. And then when I find something that speaks to me, I can buy it right there, already imagining how I might incorporate it into my wardrobe.  I like the varsity trend because I love a good uniform. It feels like a slightly more grown-up version of the school girl scheme I fell for in Japan. It’s my way of making up for ten years of surfer tank tops, Warner Brothers sweatshirts, and skorts. I’m a big kid now."

"Being one of a kind, being different, is a huge plus." “Growing up in the Bronx, I always felt like the underdog. I was too tall, had too many freckles, and I was light-skinned. I was teased and harassed every day. I isolated myself because I was so uncomfortable in my own skin. My mom worried about my lack of self-esteem, so she enrolled me in a modeling school — and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  It was there that I realized being one of a kind, being different, is a huge plus. All of a sudden I found myself making a living off of my freckles! I don’t just want to be a model, I want to inspire people. If you love yourself, you can make a lane for yourself like I did. Fashion shows people who you are — but shopping is not easy for me. I’m super tall, so I have difficulty finding the right length. Also, when it comes to my outfits, I tend to like weird things, so finding things that feel original to me is so important.  Every time I click on Macy’s The Edit to purchase a piece, it’s a breath of fresh air. All of the trends are so well put together and in your face! I love this varsity trend because it's sporty yet casual at the same time. The silhouette is form fitting but not too snug. Having a wardrobe you love makes you feel confident and allows you to say, ‘Okay, I can walk outside and be comfortable and turn heads.’ That's an amazing feeling."

			 Have you noticed how often she's worn this sexy style? As we've discussed before, Kourtney Kardashian has an Italian vacation uniform which basically consists of a bra top with pants. On Monday, we got another example of this when her model boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, posted a cute couple pic: This time, to switch things up a bit, Kourtney topped off the ensemble with an unbuttoned, oversized blue blazer, which let her white bikini-style top peek through. She accessorized with white sandals and looked very good. Meanwhile, Younes wore a pair of medium-wash jeans, white sneakers, and a partially unbuttoned dress shirt. He also looked very good. Let's just say it: These two are hawt.  Younes captioned his sweet snap in Italian, writing, "italia con la mia cara," which means, "Italy with my love." Awwwwwwwwwwwww. So there you have it: Kourtney and Younes are both cute and hot and also always on vacation. Who is jealous? Not me, obviously. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 She stole this look from her sister Kim's style book. The Met Gala may be over, but that doesn't mean Kendall Jenner's show-stopping style is taking a break. On Tuesday night, she attended an intimate dinner in NYC, hosted by Business of Fashion, wearing absolutely no shirt.  Somehow this is very exposed, yet very covered up at the same time. Shall we see it from multiple angles? Girl has got to be wearing a sh*t ton of fashion tape. Honestly, this topless pantsuit situation — which was not fastened until well past the pant waistline area — reminds me of a style move that Kendall's sister Kim is always pulling. Remember this look? Speaking of Kim, she was there too! She wore a very fitted yellow bustier number with corset detailing that was almost reminiscent of her Met Ball ensemble. Kylie also attended the dinner (with BFF Jordyn Woods) and wore a skintight midi dress that highlighted her curves. And let's not forget about mama Kris who was also there in her own sexy LBD. Here's everyone together. 🔥🔥🔥 This crew really knows how to pose. Anyway, BRB, finding a pantsuit, all the fashion tape, and the balls to wear something like this out in public.

			 Uh, there's a lot going on here. Here's what we know: Kim Kardashian played softball on a field in Los Angeles with her mom and sisters on Tuesday. She did so in this head-to-toe Yeezy look: It's really quite something. While this type of athleisure outfit is to be expected from Kim — she's been spotted in similar styles countless times — it's a little confusing in this context just because that is not a sports bra. There's no way it is providing athletic support. If you have extra time, please click here to see what the rest of her family was wearing. Hint: it was not anything like what she was wearing. Nevertheless, if you have a softball game coming up, and you want to give Kim's style a try (for less), shop her ensemble below! $7 SHOP NOW $170 SHOP NOW $14 SHOP NOW Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.

			 She’s hosted a Halloween bash 18 years 👏  in 👏 a 👏 row 👏. Heidi Klum is many things: a supermodel, a self-proclaimed nudist, judge on America’s Got Talent: The Champions, and official queen of Halloween. The woman has been hosting Halloween parties since she was 27 years old! And every dang year, she outdoes herself. One year, she spent $10 million to clone herself (warning: the pics are pretty scary); another year, she committed seven hours of her time to a Werewolf costume. She puts the rest of us to shame! Here’s a look back at all the insane, elaborate, mind-blowing costumes Heidi Klum has worn every October since 2000. For Heidi’s first bash, she wore a costume with vague S&M vibes—spikes, patent leather, you know—and two Pippi Longstocking braids.  Sure, it’s clear that Heidi is in costume here, but looking at this, you’d have no idea how committed she would become to the art of dressing up in the years to come. Heidi leveled up quite a bit for her second Halloween party, dressing up as Lady Godiva—but an injured or dead version, given the blood dripping from her mouth. Heidi wore a floor-length blonde wig and a sparkly white bodysuit, which was pretty conservative by Lady Godiva standards. Legend has it that the English noblewoman rode her horse buck naked through town. Legit.  The horse wasn’t Heidi’s only date to the party (although we’ll give her a 10/10 for pulling off that grand entrance). Her now ex-husband, Ric Pipino, showed up as a knight in shining armor.  Year three of the model’s Halloween hosting duties gave us scary Betty Boop—scary because she wore fangs under her red pout. Why, you ask? The world may never know.  The key to Heidi’s Betty Boop getup was her hair and makeup. The model wore a black wig, curled with Betty’s signature loops, and rocked some serious lashes to appear even more cartoon-like. Here, Heidi poses with model Karolína Kurková, who dressed like a 1920s flapper. Guys, this was before Instagram existed! Can you even??  Ric was Heidi’s date once again and he opted for an Elvis Presley costume. Those platform shoes totally steal the show, IMO. It’s unclear what exactly Heidi dressed as in 2003. A...golden...monster...alien? What’s obvious is that she went all out, from her braids all the way down to those wild boots. The model spray-painted her body with gold glitter, rocked a set of gold teeth, and painted her eyebrows gold to finish off the look. If you were lucky enough to attend Heidi’s party in ’03 (any of you???), then you already know she made a grand entrance: She arrived in a gold space ship onstage. Ooookkkkayyy then. In 2004, Heidi arrived at her party dressed as a scantily clad witch with scarlet hair. Her makeup was amazing, as usual. She also kindly gave a skeleton a piggyback ride on her way in. She is committed, okay?  Apparently, the model had a whole “fly into the party like an actual witch” thing planned, but she ended up getting stuck in her harness (see exhibit A), which undid the witch illusion. Hate when that happens! It doesn’t look like her failed stunt put a damper on her fun though. Here’s Heidi posing with her then-boyfriend Seal, who was dressed as the phantom from The Phantom of the Opera. Heidi loves wearing a good stiletto boot with her Halloween costume, and I’d reckon to say that she may have even planned her whole look around her footwear this year. In ’05, she wore black patent leather thigh-high boots to complement her gothic vampire ensemble. Chiiic.  The model finished off her vampire costume with long fangs, an enormous curly wig, and a bleeding heart pinned to her corset dress, as one does. Seal showed up dressed as a cop. Based on the Getty archives, it seems like a lot of handcuff jokes were made. Back in 2006, Heidi and Seal arrived at her annual shindig as actual couple costume #goals (sorry, but it’s true!). He went as Eve and she was the proverbial forbidden fruit. Name a more iconic costume, I’ll wait. It was later revealed that Heidi was concealing a pregnancy, and suddenly the bulky costume made a lot more sense for the Victoria’s Secret model.  No one can say that Heidi doesn’t make sacrifices in the name of Halloween. “The problem with that was that I was so big, I couldn’t fit into a car, so I had to get a convertible at the last moment just so I could get to the party,” she told the New York Post. “I couldn’t drink water because my arms didn’t reach my face. I couldn’t even sit. That wasn’t so much fun—I didn’t fully think that one through!” After such an ordeal with her apple suit, Heidi opted for a much more relaxed look the following year. The model arrived in a gray bodysuit dressed as a fierce feline.  At first glance, Heidi’s 2007 getup seems simple, but the model went above and beyond with things like makeup and accessories. In addition to colored contacts, fangs, and a stick on nose and whiskers, Heidi wore a collar around her neck that read: “If Lost, Please Return to Seal.” A bright blue bodysuit fitted with additional arms and gold jewels helped Heidi pull off her costume as the Hindu goddess, Kali. Seal coordinated with his wife, wearing a warrior costume.  Heidi said that her assistant came up with the idea for this elaborate costume. “My husband and I were in India last year, so she said, ‘Why don’t you do an Indian goddess? Like a scary Indian goddess?’ And I said ‘Okay!’’ But Hindu leaders criticized the costume, saying that it was “denigrating.”  Heidi and Seal twinned in 2009 as two crows. While the costumes made the couple look like monster-size birds, the getups weren’t at all practical. “It was bad. My husband was driving and he could hardly see anything,” Heidi said. “When you have a beak on, you can’t talk to anyone, you can’t really drink. It’s not a good costume.” Noted! Even though most of her face was covered with an elaborate headpiece, Heidi still went all out with her makeup, rocking long lashes and a full face of face paint. The already 5'9" model isn’t necessarily a shrinking violet, but add some boots on stilts and robot armor and you’ve got the supermodel-robot costume that Heidi arrived in at her party in 2010. Heidi fully committed to the superhero getup, complete with colored contacts, a sky-high red wig, and glittery skin that combined Iron Man’s metallic armor with Mystique’s bold colors.  Heidi described the costume as being “larger than life” and she was being literal when she said that: She towered over everyone at the party—including her husband, Seal.

			 Mark May 12 on your calendars now, people. Just do it.  If you needed to be reminded, Mother's Day is May 12. But just in case you're a procrastinator, there are plenty of items out there that'll be delivered to your door in two days or less. Here are some of the best Mother's Day gift ideas on Amazon, which even offers next-day and same-day shipping on certain items if you're really in a bind—so you can have your gift-giving bases covered just before mom's big holiday. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? subscribe here. Her cheekbones will be absolutely *lit* with a highlighter palette featuring four gorgeous shades that she can use individually or all at once.  Her under-eye area will thank you when she uses this super lightweight eye cream. It includes hyaluronic acid, shea butter, and caffeine to moisturize, minimize fine lines, and reduce puffiness.  If she's a bath person, she'll totally love this bamboo tray that props up a book, has a designated phone spot, and (most importantly) a wine glass holder.  A yoga mat that rolls up all by itself might seem like magic, but it actually exists! This one is like one of those slap bands: It lays flat during a workout, then with one roll, it conveniently curls back up. No one likes spending five minutes of their day untangling their headphones. Mom will love these wireless AirPods that will stay put in her ears and also come with a handy charging case.  A pair of ballet flats with cute lace-up details that have more than 60 5-star reviews? Say no more. They'll be her fave new footwear.  Dress up her sofa or bed with an ultra-soft woven throw. She can nestle in it when she's watching a movie, reading a book, or drinking coffee on the porch.  If she's not a bright red statement lip kind of person, try a deeper pink shade with a hint of shimmer. It is also hydrating and offers the perfect amount of shine.  Mom's home will smell like a relaxing garden with a rose-scented candle that also has deeper notes of patchouli and oud.  Mother's Day is the perfect opportunity to upgrade your mom's old, worn-out cookbook with a new recipe collection.  Treat her to a hydrating toner that restores and soothes skin; plus, the pink bottle will look so cute by her sink.  Moms always love to tell you to put a coaster under your drink, so why not get her this chic yet functional marble and gold set?  Sometimes, a heartfelt, handwritten card—like an elegant one with florals and gold lettering—is all Mom wants. Treat her to a simple yet gorgeous mother of pearl necklace with a gold chain, which she can wear with any outfit.  If she has a major sweet tooth, beautifully decorated chocolate-covered strawberries might be the ideal gift.  She'll be reminded how awesome she is every morning when she uses this gold-accented mug to drink her coffee or tea.  Moms are always busy, and they deserve time to relax with calming, lavender-scented bath salts.  Flowers in an elegant vase are a simple yet classic gift. An elegant gold wine chiller is a gift she'll obsess over and use all the time when company is over.  Fashion-forward moms will love a trendy new pair of wide-leg jeans, which pair well with printed tops.  If you feel like splurging a little, a 14k gold diamond ring will become her new go-to piece of jewelry. Mother's Day is the perfect time to buy mom a brand-new (and very fluffy) pair of slippers that she'll adore wearing around the house.  If your mom likes to keep everything in the same place, she'll appreciate a wallet that performs double-duty as a phone case.  A classic floral scent that's not too heavy will become her new favorite fragrance she can add to her vanity.  If your mom loves hosting dinner parties, she'll adore a matching set of pink floral napkins. An easy-to-use (and very portable) photo printer is perfect for moms who scrapbook or simply love putting photo albums together.

			 She took the religion theme seriously and got raptured, tbh. She deserves it!! OK so it's 9:15 p.m. on a Monday night and I'm about to go to bed tbh but festivities at this year's Costume Institute Gala are just getting started! The celebs and rich people lucky enough to have scored (or, in the case of the rich folk, paid a pretty penny for) tickets have all walked the red carpet in their fiercest habits and wimples, and are now pretending to be interested by the Vatican Guard's pantaloons before the real fun and games get started. And by "fun and games" I mean drinking games. It's not a Catholicism-themed Met Ball until someone turns water into sparkling wine, after all! Transubstantiation is so on trend rn. That said, for the SECOND YEAR IN A ROW, Beyoncé is not in attendance  — this, incidentally, means her last Met Gala look is that unfortunate latex gown everyone thought looked like pimples. In 2017, she took a rain check given that she was heavily pregnant with her twins Rumi and Sir; this time around Entertainment Tonight reports that she RSVP'd "thanks but no thanks" in the end, because her husband Jay-Z has taken her on a relaxing vacation ahead of their "On The Run II" tour. Bey had apparently been planning on attending, with her designer of choice, Peter Dundas, having been "working for weeks" on her dress before she changed her mind. For Pete's sake, Bey! Maybe she's at least wearing it on a beach somewhere? Of course, another good reason for her no-show? This year's theme — "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination" — is pretty serious affront to the Church of Beysus Christ, let's be honest. Repent and confess y'alls sins, Met Gala-goers, for it may not be too late to ask forgiveness. (Selena Gomez, looking at you in particular in this hot sunbed mess of an ensemble.) Beysus is nothing if not benevolent.

			 We’ve got you covered—literally.  Everyone’s taste in lingerie is different—but whether you want to feel cute, sexy, cozy, or comfortable (or all of the above), there’s a brand out there that checks all the right boxes. Here, 25 favorites that deliver on fit and quality and will make you feel confident as hell.  While the brand also offers bralettes, balconettes, T-shirt bras, and more, the seamless designs are the true MVPs here. (This style in particular has a four-star rating with more than 600 reviews. ) They lay super flat against your skin, retain their stretch, and have a buttery smooth fabric that doesn’t irritate.  Yes, you can totally order cute lingerie on Amazon! The retailer's own brand, Mae, offers sophisticated  pieces, like this deep V-neck bodysuit, for super affordable prices. Its underwear and bras have tons of great reviews, too, and who can turn down sexy, elevated designs on a budget?  The New York-based brand is all about comfort, but its designs are also so dang cute. Certain designs go up to a DDD, and the pretty pieces are ideal to incorporate into your outfits (e.g., wearing them under a slightly sheer shirt).  J.Crew’s lingerie features lots of cute patterns (like this floral number), sheer fabrics, and contrast trim. Bralettes run from XS to XXL, while cup sizes range from 32A to 36D. The brand actually based its intimates line off of its best-selling swimwear, so if you own a J.Crew bikini, odds are the lingerie will fit similarly.  Always find yourself veering away from plain black bras and underwear? Dora Larsen is the brand you’ll want to look into. Her creations often feature tricolor designs, like this yellow, white, and pink set seen here. Everything is also under $100, so you don’t have to stress about dropping too much cash for expensive-looking lingerie.  This brand is all about show-stopping pieces—I mean, just look at this verrry exposed bra. Sure, they might not be the most practical for everyday use, but the brand definitely focuses on eye-catching designs that you can pull out of your drawer for special saucy occasions.  The New Zealand brand gained popularity when Girls actresses Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke starred in its viral unretouched campaign in 2016. It offers sets in a range of dreamy colors like pale pink, pastel yellow, olive green, white, and lilac. Bra sizes range from A to E and the bottoms from XS to XL, and also feature high-waisted, brief, and cheeky styles.  Rihanna changed the cosmetics game when she launched Fenty Beauty in 2017, and she did the same with the release of her size-inclusive Savage X Fenty lingerie line. The spectrum of styles include super sweet lace pieces, saucy corsets, and leather pasties. Bra and bottom sizes range from 32A to 44DD and XS to 3x, respectively.  If you love cutesy sets that you can also use for everyday wear, give this brand a try. The lingerie company, launched in 2014 by Dutch designer Marloes Hoedeman, offers luxe-looking pieces that are also relatively affordable.  The supermodel-turned-designer has worn lingerie a LOT, especially as a staple on the Victoria’s Secret catwalk back in the day, so it’s safe to say she’s familiar with its form and fit. Heidi’s designs toe the line of sexy and sweet (like this plunging sheer bra with matching briefs) and come in an array of styles—even maternity bras—so you’re guaranteed to find a set you love.  Founded in 1996, this Italian brand has been making waves stateside because of its affordable prices and classic styles, like this polka-dot one here. In addition to its matching sets, it also offers slips, camisoles, and bodysuits, so if you like donning sleepwear both in and out of bed, take note.  ThirdLove created its first bra in 2013, but the direct-to-consumer brand experienced an insane surge in popularity this year thanks to its launch of 24 new sizes—including half sizes—and the subsequent wait list of thousands of women waiting to try them. Bras are available in cup sizes A–I in band sizes from 30" to 48", and bottoms are available from XS to 3X.  Don’t be scared off by the fancy name. Fleur du Mal is a New York-based brand that uses French lace and silk to make its super luxurious lingerie sets, like the one pictured here. The company also makes silk robes, so if you’re willing to splurge on the cost (fair warning: they cost a pretty penny) know that you can lounge around your apartment and look hella chic.  Love yourself a cute printed pattern? Then Morgan Lane is totally up your alley. Some styles from the brand even feature hand-drawn illustrations by founder Morgan Curtis. In her designs, you’ll find a cheeky and playful aesthetic, but also a comfortable fit with her wide straps, unique back closures, and not-too-tight elastic.  If you’re looking for support but also want to feel sexy, try Addition Elle. Its designs often feature standout details like mesh inserts, cutouts, bows, or lace trim that transform a basic matching set into something you’ll want to wear on special occasions—or simply because you feel like it.  The brand’s designs often include lace fabric, lace-up straps, and sheer panels if any of those suit your fancy. The mix of fabrics like velvet, lace, and satin make for super special pieces that are also comfy to wear all day long.  The brand has an impressive mix of everyday styles like thongs, briefs, and bralettes and more standout pieces, like this black lace teddy with front-tie details. The brand will become your go-to for its array of comfortable designs and its sexy aesthetic.  If you appreciate minimalist designs, Negative Underwear is the place to look for simple, yet steamy sets. The brand is a fan favorite, and its styles often sell out. Consider this label if the first thing you do when you get home is take off your bra—the designs are so comfortable, you'll want to keep them on.  This is totally the brand for you if you’re on a budget but don’t want to look like you are. The luxe pieces look like they should be a LOT more expensive—take this ultra-sexy bodysuit that’s only $45, for instance. The modern designs, which often feature lace inserts and strappy details, will become a staple in your lingerie drawer.  In 1996, founders Ali Mejia and Mariela Rovito created Eberjey, a brand that combines high-quality, durable fabrics with its signature lace designs. In addition to its classic lingerie, it also offers chic pajama sets and teddies that’ll make going to bed feel like the most luxurious part of your day.  This brand’s impressive size range spans from XS to 4X and also offers insanely sexy styles, like this strappy balconette bra and matching briefs with geometric cutouts. If you’re looking for that one “wow” piece of lingerie, scroll through the pieces here and you’re bound to find one—without dropping a ton of cash, either. You can also sign up for a monthly subscription box of styles curated especially for you.  Launched in 2012 in Los Angeles, the Scandinavian-inspired brand offers romantic lace sets and also more bold patterns, like leopard  and zebra print. The lingerie has a delicate aesthetic, but it’ll withstand daily wear with its durable lining.  Lively is known for its trendy and comfy bralettes, although it does offer some underwire and strapless styles. You’ll find great basic sets on its site in black, gray, and beige, but there’s also the occasional pattern and pop of color. Especially noteworthy? The label makes a special bralette for larger busts that offers more support. Genius.  The brand, known for its comfortable yet colorful lingerie, is a fan fave when it comes to excellent fit. Its signature lace fabric doesn’t irritate the skin, while the stretch allows a snug fit that doesn’t cause slippage. You’ll love wearing these sets lounging around your house.  If you need a brand that offers larger cup sizes, Elomi is just the one for you—it goes all the way to a K cup, FYI. While it’s diverse in sizing, it also features stylish designs, like this lace and spotted set. It’ll have you covered for every occasion, whether you need a cute T-shirt bra or want something more strappy and sexy.  Looking for non-boring styles that are available in inclusive sizes? Then you’ll want to peruse Cacique’s selection stat (the brand is Lane Bryant’s intimates line). The styles don’t skimp on support, but they still offer cute patterns and colors, as evidenced by this lace-and-houndstooth underwire set.

Then, it keeps it at that temp for hours. He’ll never have to wait to drink his coffee again. He may not be the next Top Chef, but his kitchen doesn’t have to give that away. This curated set includes everything he needs to jump-start his cooking journey. For the best man with a discerning palate, this cognac is something he probably hasn’t tried yet! It’s wonderfully complex and smooth.

			 A model and fashion lawyer are teaming up to create a program for anyone in need. In the wake of the #MeToo movement and Time's Up, more people across different industries are breaking their silence on the injustices and inappropriate behavior they've experienced. The fashion industry has been grappling with the same issues, but now, a model and a fashion lawyer are answering the question, "What comes next?" with the creation of a new platform, the Humans of Fashion Foundation, which launched on Tuesday. The HOF Foundation is essentially a website (humansoffashion.org) with an advisory board of top lawyers and law firms, doctors, counselors, and therapists willing to help anyone in the fashion industry — not just models, but also makeup artists, stylists, photographer assistants, and others — in need of their skills, and pro-bono if necessary.  The resource is the brainchild of Kristina Romanova, a 23-year-old model who has worked with brands including Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Marc Jacobs, and Antoniette Costa, a 32-year-old fashion lawyer who has worked with well-known companies like the Yankees and Louis Vuitton.  Co-founder Kristina explains the mission behind #HOFFoundation and how it will address sexual harassment and abuse in the fashion industry. 📹 by @daveprokopec #nonprofit #Fashion #NYFW. A post shared by  Humans of Fashion Foundation (@humansoffashionf) on Feb 6, 2018 at 5:56am PST It's particularly important to have a resource like this in fashion, Costa points out, because many people in the industry are freelancers and have no central HR department to consult. "With the advent of Instagram, there's even more of a need to have a system in place," Costa says, because talent, photographers, or makeup artists who have large followings there — and use the platform to book their jobs — might not have any representation at all. "A Harvard business study found that by the age of 31, 46 percent of women in America have been harassed," adds Romanova. Having flown to the U.S. to start her career in modeling at age 16, she has many of her own stories. "There have been many times I've been in uncomfortable situations," she says. "Men sometimes would be touchy on set or say inappropriate things. I never knew how to deal with that [early in my career]. It would have been nice to have a place to go to, someone to talk to for advice." While HOF Foundation was formed, for the most part, as a way to provide guidance and support to anyone in the industry who has dealt with inappropriate sexual behavior, it also aims to help models and industry insiders with other issues, including visa disputes, depression, eating disorders, and other medical problems. "Protecting your rights or getting advice shouldn't be based on who has the money to pay for it," says Costa.  Right now, in order to connect with a professional through the HOF Foundation, all you need to do is go to the website, and reach out to the e-mail listed (humans@humansoffashion.org) explaining your case. In the future, the duo plans to create an app, which users can download for free. From there, you'll be able to navigate and find the kind of professional help or support you need, and reach out directly. Costa and Romanova acknowledge there's a lot of positive change happening in the fashion industry right now. They see the Humans of Fashion Foundation as their contribution. "The silence has been broken [on sexual harassment], but what is there to do now?" Costa says. "There has to be something to do afterwards."

			 GET. SHOPPING. Even with luxury designers at her beck and call, Meghan Markle can't seem to stay away from her favorite high street brand J. Crew. On Thursday morning, the Duchess of Sussex arrived at the Sentebale Polo 2018 match to cheer on Prince Harry, wearing a chic Caroline Herrera denim midi dress, nude heels, and a J. Crew straw clutch you'll now wish you owned. A clear favorite amongst the royal ladies, Pippa Middleton also carried the Fan Rattan Clutch at Wimbledon earlier this year.  Feel #MeghanMarkleEffect kicking in? Well you can buy the affordable piece, currently on sale, for $35 with the code "FLASH". If you're feeling bold, there's also a bright yellow version on sale for $30. Stock up now before they fly off the e-shelves and you're left in the dust.

			 It is *SO* unique. Um, HOLY CRAP, guys. You need to see this, so let me get to the point: You know how Emily Ratajkowski got suprise-married at City Hall in NYC a few months back? At the time, she just had a simple gold band from now-husband Sebastian Bear-McClard, but, like, that has ALL CHANGED because now she has this gargantuan double-diamond situation that will literally blind you. From space.   Did I tell you or did I tell you? This thing is huge and so unique. The two stones in the setting appear to be teardrop- and princess-cut. Together with a narrow, gold band, they sit just beneath her original, thicker wedding ring. It is truly a stunning look.     Even though this new ring is, like, W-O-W, Emily will most-likely always cherish her simple gold band, as her husband literally forged it and his own. "We walked into Chinatown and bought an ounce of gold and [Sebastian] was like, 'We'll melt down the gold and make the rings,'" she told Jimmy Fallon. "It was supposed to be temporary but I'm now growing attached to it and I don't wanna get rid of it. I just feel like making it yourself—could it be more personal?" Well, now she quite honestly has the best of both worlds. Congrats, you love birds! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 It’s not as easy and effortless as it looks.  You will never see me in a pair of ass-less chaps or a chain-mail bra. Also, posting an Instagram photo is a painful, time-consuming process for me. (Captions = so hard.) Understanding these two facts, you may wonder why I jumped at the chance to attend a festival at which that’s the main dress code and social media snaps are basically the currency.  Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment? Maybe I have been totally brainwashed by my feed? Either way, I found myself at the unofficial Instagram event of the year, the Revolve Festival, which takes place just outside the Coachella grounds in Indio, California.  #REVOLVEfestival officially starts now! 🌸✨ follow along & watch our stories for day 1 of the hottest party in the desert A post shared by  REVOLVE (@revolve) on Apr 13, 2019 at 2:57pm PDT In case you weren’t aware, Revolve is a website that sells supercute clothes, accessories, and beauty products. Every year, it puts on a weekend-long celebration the same dates as the Coachella Music Festival’s Weekend One, legit around the corner from the entrance.  Guests at the Revolve shindig have to be invited to attend—you can’t really buy a ticket, although the brand and certain affiliated influencers do giveaways for lucky followers. Once you’re inside, everything is free, including food, alcohol, and performances by people like Cardi B and Offset, Tyga, and SZA (this year’s lineup). There are also no-cost braid bars, freebie merch stations, and LaCroix as far as the eye can see. Every station is set up perfectly for pictures, and everyone you meet there is shameless about taking them. Oh, there’s also a chair swing and a carousel.  always enjoy LaCroix 💦 add some flavor into your day with a @lacroixwater at #REVOLVEfestival A post shared by  REVOLVE (@revolve) on Apr 13, 2019 at 4:24pm PDT Scroll on to see how one non-influencer learned the ins and outs of Instagramming the most Instagrammable place on earth. 
   Don’t feel pressure to pack certain clothes you *think* are festival-y. The truth is, festival fashion is anything you want to wear to a festival. It doesn’t have to be ass-less, fringy, or completely see-through, unless you want it to be (and you do you, plz). I made sure to stuff lots of layering pieces in my suitcase, because believe it or not, it gets COLD at night in the desert. I also had a color scheme because I couldn’t decide on the outfits I wanted to wear ahead of time, so this way, I could mix and match everything. In case you’re interested, my color scheme was pink, red, white, and neutrals. Don’t forget important desert necessities. It’s dusty and dirty on the festival grounds, both at Revolve and at Coachella. Bandannas are important so you don’t get dirt up your nose. Sunglasses serve the same purpose of protecting your eyes. Chapstick and close-toe shoes are also great, FYI. ALSO: Do NOT forget to wear all the sunscreen.  ☀️ #revolvefestival prep with @supergoop - link in bio to shop @laviedefawn A post shared by  REVOLVE BEAUTY (@revolvebeauty) on Apr 13, 2019 at 8:12am PDT Stay in a hotel built for the ’gram. I.e. the V Palm Springs, which turns into ~Hotel Revolve~ during the first weekend of Coachella. Revolve hosts many of the influencers who come to its festival, including VS Angels, former Bachelor contestants, and media at various houses around Palm Springs, California.   we’re here! 🌴☀️ just checking in at #hotelREVOLVE #REVOLVEfestival A post shared by  REVOLVE (@revolve) on Apr 11, 2019 at 6:50pm PDT The hotel is the best place to be, though, because that’s where Revolve puts up the vast majority of its guests. It also has all the free food (I was partial to the shrimp tacos) and drinks (margs all day, TYVM), shuttles to the festival, and more.  BOOK NOW Hotel V, Palm Springs   Staying cool with iced matchas! ☀️#CoachellaWeekend #FindYourHilltop #VPalmSprings #hotelREVOLVE #REVOLVEfestival A post shared by  V Palm Springs (@vpalmsprings) on Apr 14, 2019 at 9:21am PDT  Related: There was a fun swing on my room’s patio!  There’s a swing in my room! #revolvefestival A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Apr 12, 2019 at 2:52pm PDT Take advantage of the pool floats. At each of the houses and at the hotel’s two pools, there were colorful floats aplenty. These make for great pictures, as pretty much everyone on my feed proved.   a ray of sunshine ☀️ @pamallier in the @lovewave milly top + shorts - tap to shop! A post shared by  REVOLVE (@revolve) on Apr 12, 2019 at 10:40pm PDT  Head to the festival. Upon entering it, you’ll quickly realize that everywhere you turn, there’s a photo op. The first 100 feet consist of a series of floral and patterned archways. I had taken approx. 12 steps when I found this one:  Had to crop out an anonymous passer-by’s major thong moment to make this pic safe for the ‘gram 🌺🌸🌼. #REVOLVEfestival A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Apr 15, 2019 at 4:26pm PDT It’s too good to waste on one outfit, so it’s great that the festival lasts two days. Some influencers take extra advantage of all the pretty flower vibes and millennial-pink carnival rides by bringing a bag full of other outfit options that’ll squeeze the event space for all it’s worth.  Me: *Has never flashed a peace sign for a picture in my life.* Me as soon as I walk into #revolvefestival, apparently: *✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️* A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Apr 18, 2019 at 9:47am PDT Ride all the rides. The chair swing and the carousel at Revolve Festival are definitely picture perfect, but they’re also actually super fun to ride.   Save a horse, ride a carousel 🎠 (idk, I’m running out of caption ideas) A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Apr 16, 2019 at 9:45am PDT Go to that ~other~ festival too. You know the one. The real one? Nabbing tickets to Revolve Festival doesn’t mean you have to miss out on the headline performers playing at Coachella. My friends and I went to the Revolve grounds during the day, then headed to Coachella in the evening when most of the major acts took their place onstage. Hello, Ariana!  thank u from the bottom of my heart to everybody who dedicated their time and energy to this beautiful moment 🖤 i’m almost done posting  about it. and an extra thank u to @diddy for the most special words and energy. 🖤 i was kinda speechless n trying not to cry. i love u forreal. thank u.  another extra thank u to my sis @nickiminaj for handling that shit with me. we couldn’t hear shit lmao but the audience’s energy carried us thru! 🙈 i love u endlessly and can’t thank u enough for being there. another one for the books lol. A post shared by  Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Apr 15, 2019 at 4:03pm PDT Of course, there are plenty of places to snap pics there too, but the biggest thing you need in the shot to prove you went? The ferris wheel in the background. You can kinda see it in the distance here:  En route to a glass of Prosecco 🎡🥂 A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Apr 13, 2019 at 9:32am PDT Unwind.

			 Our 35th president loved to layer, apparently.  While you may know and love them best as the brand behind your favorite graphic tees and frayed denim skirts, Abercrombie & Fitch has a long history of creating classically American clothes. Even John F. Kennedy wore Abercrombie & Fitch — specifically, their chinos — and the brand is celebrating that style moment with a capsule collection inspired by the 35th president of the United States.  Available in stores and online today, the collection includes a sailing jacket, a hooded fleece, swim trunks, and a modern interpretation of the infamous chino (with a high waist and straight leg).  The color scheme? Red, white, and blue, of course. A rope motif also figures throughout, a harkening to Kennedy's love of sailboating. "The team is proud to honor and highlight JFK with a collection inspired by the American icon’s timeless style and adventurous spirit," Abercrombie & Fitch said in a press release about the collection. The only bad news about this collection is that it's designed for men. While anyone can certainly wear a cool chino or a cozy fleece, we're ready for the Jackie O capsule, A&F.

			 Here’s what you gotta know to prepare!!!  Summer is the best season for a lot of reasons: the warm weather, beach trips, vacations, and the fact that you can finally wear all your cute sandals and maxi dresses. But above all? Amazon’s Prime Day always takes place this season, duuuh.    The site announced that it’ll be happening this year not just on a single day but over the course of TWO days. On July 15 and 16—and even in the days leading up to then—you can score tons of items at a discount. The press release says more than One. Million. Deals. will be offered globally. Whoa.  Everything from Schwinn bikes to Levi’s jeans to Alexa devices to this Toshiba Fire TV that’s already on sale?!  Also in the mix are featured Lightning Deals, where limited quantities of items will be heavily discounted—but they sell out VERY fast.  GET YOURSELF A PRIME MEMBERSHIP HERE  Well, for starters, you can get unlimited access to TV shows (highly recommend Fleabag, BTW) and movies, enjoy discounts and deliveries from Whole Foods, and also receive same-day shipping for FREE—wild, right?!—in select cities. If you’re a college student, you can get a free six-month trial here, and if not, you can still test it out for yourself with a 30-day trial here. You’ll also be able to reap the benefits of Prime Day and finally understand why all your friends are talking about it.   As a seasoned Amazon shopper myself, my advice is to smash the Bookmark button and keep checking back for new deals that’ll pop up over those 48 hours. In the meantime, you can browse these Prime Day launches, which are new products offered specifically for members that you can preorder, or they’ll become available on the 15th.   And you best believe we’ll be updating this post as more cute things go on sale leading up to Prime Day. You’re so welcome.

			 In her book, the supermodel writes that she often felt like she was torn between two different body types.  At the start of my career, I lived in a “two body” world. One was full of beautiful white girls who would excitedly be like “OMG, you are so skinny!” The other was my beautiful African-American community of friends and family, who were always trying to fatten me up.  So when I gained weight around the age of 22, after years of successful runway modeling, I didn’t care. All the black people clapped their hands, like my body was coming along nicely and I’d finally started listening to what they’d been telling me since I was 12. The modeling world, on the other hand, felt differently. They weren’t happy. In fact, they were pissed. I will never forget a certain man from the industry and the look on his face as I sat across from him at lunch. I thought he was about to tell me I’d booked a huge job, but he said, shaking his head, “You’ve had your moment. There are only about two or three girls who can become icons every 10 years, and you couldn’t possibly do that. You can be a catalog girl now.”  The words flew out of his mouth so fast that I knew this was the speech he pulled out of his files for just such an occasion. This was the “You is over, bitch” lunch.  After years of being the It Girl, now I was about to become the Out Girl. I went home and cried to my mother. I said I wanted to keep modeling,that I’d lose weight, that I’d try anything. My mother grabbed me by the shoulders and told me to stop it. Soon we were sitting in our favorite pizza place at our usual table in the corner, and Mama took out a pen and paper and handed it to me.  It’s just one week until Mother’s Day! My Mama loves me despite all my attempts to drive her crazy! 🤪  Order #PerfectIsBoring today and get it for your Mama, Auntie, daughter, granny, or anyone you love! It’s a fun, quick and easy read for everyone! 💛  @cindycrawford read it in a day! #FierceGift #LinkInBio A post shared by  Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) on May 6, 2018 at 10:06am PDT “Now,” she said, “write down every client in the industry that likes ass.” “Ass?” “Who likes that ass?!” she demanded. By the time we’d finished our pizza, I had a list of commercial clients who booked the bold and bootyful. I sat back and looked at the list, now mottled with grease stains and dots of tomato sauce, and I slowly started to smile. My career didn’t have to be over. It just had to be different. I stopped focusing on runway work and started to think of other places to model… yes, even catalogs. I ended up getting booked to do the Victoria’s Secret catalog, which was new at the time. That first shoot turned into a 10-year contract, and that catalog became a very big deal. I became the first black girl on the cover, which turned into my being one of the original angels.  It wasn’t long after that that I was asked to pose for Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit issue, which was a huge deal for me as well. All these years later, I am still doing what I love. So straight up, this is what I learned: When a career opportunity looks like it might turn out to be a dead end, don’t turn around and go home.Success is not a straight line; it is a winding road. There are all sorts of curves and roadblocks and traffic jams.  The important thing is to keep going. Climb, crawl, leapfrog, high-jump, pole-vault, catapult—do whatever you gotta do to get and staywhere you need to be. And if you get a few scrapes and bruises along the way, cherish them. Those are your scars from the journey and show how hard you worked to get where you are. Oh, and don’t forget to smize.

			 Make like the red-dress lady and dance your way through the night.  If you’re looking for some Halloween costume inspiration this year, look no further than your emoji keyboard. There are so many options to choose from, and you’ll be instantly recognizable. Here, 20 emoji costumes that’ll make you 😂.  Tag yourself. I’m the pizza girl.  Really a wide range of emotions happening here.  When you love sushi so much that you dress up like it.  Definitely a diverse group of friends.  When you’re in love but you’re also emojis.  The perfect response to the inevitable question, “What are you going to be for Halloween?” If you and your friends are really good at papier-mâché and also have a shared love for these lil monkey emojis, this is the group costume for you.  You and your bestie probably use this emoji all the time, so why not embody it for Halloween?  If your bae is willing to do an emoji couples costume with you, never let them go.  An eggplant beanie? GENIUS.  You don’t even need emojis when you can text photos of yourself doing all these poses to the group chat. Name a more unusual emoji trio. I’ll wait.  Who knows why these dancing emoji ladies have bunny ears, but that’s exactly why they’re so iconic.  Relax, they’re fake scissors!  These guys TOTALLY nailed it.   Throw on heart sunglasses, glue heart-shaped felt onto a yellow shirt, and you’ll look so in love for Halloween.  And then there’s the emoji that embodies all your weekend plans—what would we do without the salsa-dancing lady?! Sure, this emoji may be poop, but it looks pretty happy about it.  Paint me like one of your French girls.  This little purple devil always looks like it’s up to something, but it also makes a pretty cute costume, right?

			 You and your wallet will be VERY happy with these. If you love shopping for new clothes but hate looking at your bank account balance after, I have news for you: There are so many websites out there with affordable—but still fashionable—styles that will save you money and leave you looking cute as hell. Here, 15 inexpensive retailers that will make shopping a win-win for you and your wallet. This Swedish company is known for its insanely-low prices and trendy styles—it's basically the clothing version of IKEA. If you need something new to wear to work or for a night out, you can easily find a variety of items, like the oversized blazer here for under $35.  Odds are you've heard of/have already shopped at Forever 21, but if you're one of the few who haven't, it's filled with inexpensive styles, like embroidered tie-front tops, flowy maxis, and matching sets that would make great additions to any summer wardrobe. Your money will go a LONG way at this store because everything is so dang cheap, which makes it the perfect place to search for trendy bright colors, '90s vibes, and street-style fashion.  If you are in a pinch and need an outfit for a hot date/engagement party/music festival stat but don't want to spend your entire savings account, ASOS is the place to go. They have plenty of styles to choose from, whether you want a casual mesh top or a formal gown for a wedding. Plus, its two-day shipping feature is a game changer.  Amazon fashion is so underrated! The site has tons of trendy and affordable clothes, like this sweet floral wrap dress, for instance. And if you have Amazon Prime, the free shipping will save you even more money that you could spend on—you guessed it—more clothes.  Pretty Little Thing has everything from comfy matching sets like this one to simple crop tops and OTT dresses with cutouts, but what's even better than the range of styles is the ridiculously low prices. If you can't resist a good deal, the site also includes sections with tops $7 and under and $8 dresses.  Calling all Target lovers! In addition to its incredibly chic home decor (and literally everything else it has to offer), the store also has very cute clothes that you'll want to wear ASAP. Take this striped jumpsuit, for instance. Target's clothing brands, like A New Day, Universal Thread, and Xhilaration offer trendy styles at a fraction of the price, and that just adds to the list of reasons why Target is actually the best.  Princess Polly is one of the best-kept E-comm secrets on the internet. Find cute dresses suitable for both day and night, all for less than $60. The site also has Insta-worthy tops, bottoms, outerwear, and accessories. While this site does offer some items at a higher price point, it also has affordable styles, like this $42 knot dress with ~sexy~ cutouts. If you sort the categories from the lowest to the highest price (who doesn't do this, TBH?), there's plenty of amazing steals including  $15 skater dresses and $19 tank tops you'll want to wear with everything.  Uniqlo is THE place to go for low-priced basics like relaxed T-shirts, cardigans, and boyfriend jeans. The brand also keeps up-to-date by providing trendier options like breezy culottes, high-waisted, cut-off shorts, and striped maxi dresses, while the price point on any given item is rarely above $50.   Uniqlo also offers maternity wear and has cool collabs with designers like Tomas Maier and J.W. Anderson, which can help elevate your wardrobe without breaking the bank.  Missguided is a great brand for those who have an edgier style but don't like spending a ton—take this bodysuit and ripped jeans combo, for example.  Although it mostly targets fashion risk-takers, the brand also has classic options for both curvy and straight sizes. And if you're looking for pajamas, lingerie, or swimwear, Missguided has you covered there too.  Old Navy has inclusive options without expensive price tags, including specific categories for tall, petite, and plus sizes as well as maternity clothing. Its jeans will become your new fave denim staple. The brand also has cute activewear, so you can cover all your bases on just one site.  Mango is a Spanish fast-fashion retailer with trendy, low-priced styles that puts a twist on staples in your wardrobe. Take this classic tank dress in a refreshing watermelon color, for example. The store also has colorful shirt dresses that are perfect for the office, and tropical-printed shirts that work well at the beach. No matter what you buy, your wallet won't regret it. Tobi is full of trendy, flirty pieces all at reasonable prices. The site also often has sales for 60 percent off! This snake-print skirt, which was originally $72, is only $28 thanks to one of these regular promos. A favorite brand of Cardi B and Kylie Jenner, Fashion Nova has the some of the most celebrated cheap jeans on the internet for, like, $40. It's also known for its incredibly extra bodycon dresses and matching sets. FashionNova is also super size inclusive and also has activewear, swim, and lingerie, all at the same low prices.  Okay, so you might not associate Walmart with *super* fashionable clothes, but this khaki utility dress with plenty of pockets might change your mind. The company introduced new apparel brands, like Time and Tru and Terra & Sky to up their style game with on-trend—and inexpensive—clothes. Who knows? Walmart might just become your new go-to store.

			 #TBT to the meat dress.   Lady Gaga is a true style chameleon, and there are so many versions of her: You have "Just Dance" Gaga circa 2008 with her blunt bangs and unique pop star ensembles all the way to A Star Is Born Gaga with her super-glam red carpet moments. She can really do it all, people. Here, 30 pics that show her dramatic fashion evolution through the years.  Lady Gaga performed at Lollapalooza wearing a disco ball–like bra, black underwear, and thigh-high fishnet socks.    Here, she posed in a sculptural black dress with gold crystal-esque details and neutral booties while backstage at the Y 100 Jingle Ball in Florida.   Lady Gaga wore an epic bow-shaped updo and a taupe strapless dress at a VEVO launch event. Her hairstyle is a true *gift*. Gaga donned a lacy black gown with feathered details, a headpiece, and a gold mask to the MTV Video Music Awards in New York City.   Lady Gaga performed at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles in a sparkly silver bodysuit, ripped fishnets, and lace-up boots. But the real question is: What on Earth is going on with her shoulders?!   Gaga showed up to the Brit Awards looking like a wedding cake in this wild tiered getup, complete with a sky-high hairdo and face mask.   Lady Gaga rocked a straight-up stellar look by Armani Privé at the Grammy Awards, which featured celestial rings, rhinestone heels, and a silver star she held the entire time on the red carpet. Now that's dedication.   Ah, yes. The iconic meat dress. Where would we be without this controversial but no doubt memorable ensemble? Gaga strolled up to the MTV VMAs dripping in raw meat from head to toe. It was probably the first and last time a celebrity went to a butcher shop to go shopping for a fancy event.   Lady Gaga continued to show her love of ridiculously high platforms at the CFDA Fashion Awards. She opted for a black mini with a voluminous train and mesh sleeves, then added color with her vivid red nails and a bright-turquoise bob.   Gaga showed up to the Grammys red carpet in a giant egg then burst out of it in a yellow-ish latex outfit to kick off her onstage performance. Egg Gaga > Normal Gaga, IMO.  At a press conference in Mexico City to promote her Born This Way album, Gaga donned this sheer cobalt blue midi (with matching nipple tape, no less) and her now-signature black platforms.   Lady Gaga wowed in this strappy red Versace dress with her newly auburn hair in Milan.   Always one for dramatic entrances, Lady Gaga emerged form a black and gold carriage at the Herald Square Macy's in New York City wearing an alien-like headpiece and equally spacey reflective gown.   Speaking of dramatic entrances, here's another! At the AMAs, she channeled Rapunzel/Lady Godiva in a lavender dress and long blonde hair while riding atop a mechanical puppet horse powered by people.  For her Artpop album, Gaga attended a press conference in Tokyo wearing this tartan outfit that also looked like it featured a tail wrapping around her?  Gaga channeled old Hollywood glamour in this strapless beaded dress and pink scarf by Versace at the Oscars.  After the red carpet, Gaga attended the Vanity Fair Oscar after-party in a white gown (also by Versace) featuring embellishments and side cutouts.  Gaga looked majorly artsy in this red-and-black squiggly-print outfit and short white wig while walking around Milan.  Lady Gaga continued the black and red theme one year later in London with this wrap coat and accessorized with thigh-high hosiery, pumps, and oversize sunnies.   The singer made an unexpectedly subdued statement at the Billboard Women in Music awards with minimal makeup and a matching bra top and silk skirt set.  Gaga paid tribute to David Bowie with this striking patterned coat dress, blue eyeshadow, fiery red hair, and strappy platform heels at the Grammys. She later performed a medley of Bowie songs to honor the icon, who passed away from cancer a month prior to the show.  That same month, she wowed in this Brandon Maxwell suit with a sweetheart neckline, pleats, and a flowing train. She was nominated for her first Oscar for Best Song "Til It Happens to You," and sang an emotional rendition at the show.   At the Manus x Machina Met Gala, Gaga showed up, yet again, in a pair of lace-up platform heels, which complemented her bedazzled outfit featuring a bodysuit and cropped jacket.  Lady Gaga looked extremely rock 'n' roll in a risky underboob jacket with spiky sleeves, high-waisted patent leather shorts, and matching thigh-high platform heels. Man, she really loves those things!  Lady Gaga put on an amazing Super Bowl performance (remember that viral stadium jump?!)  in this sparkly long-sleeve bodysuit  with matching boots. She even took the rhinestone factor up a notch with her bedazzled eye makeup.  At the Cannes Film Festival Lady Gaga practically broke the internet when she stepped out in this feathery Valentino frock. I mean, I'm pretty sure when you look up the word glamour in the dictionary, it's just this picture.  Just one month later, she wore this silver paillette gown with a strappy back and leg slit at an Entertainment Weekly event.   Lady Gaga looked killer in an oversize Marc Jacobs suit at Elle's 25th Annual Women in Hollywood event. Like, there's a lotta fabric happening here but she looks so GOOD.  At the Golden Globes, Gaga wore this custom periwinkle Valentino number, which was a nod to Judy Garland who was in the original A Star Is Born movie. Oh, and she also wore a casual $5 million in Tiffany & Co. jewelry. She picked up an award this night for "Shallow."   Sure, Gaga's Alexander McQueen dress with its exaggerated hip-shelf things and black opera gloves was amazing, but how about that massive yellow diamond necklace by Tiffany?! She (and Bradley Cooper) quite literally stole the show with their performance of "Shallow," and she won her first Academy Award for the song.

			 Proof you don't need to spend a ton of cash to buy him an amazing present. Father's Day is coming up (it's on June 16, ppl!), and you're probably thinking what you possibly could get him without draining your savings account. Here, 20 gift ideas that are all $50 or less, which your dad—and your wallet—will love.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! A li'l griddle that cooks eggs and pancakes (and even desserts?!) is the way to your dad's heart; plus, at only $10, it's a major steal.   Polarized sunnies with a classic tortoiseshell frame will look good with any of his summer outfits.   Not much of a gift guy? The least you could get him is a simple new T-shirt. This technical one is quick-drying so he can wear it to the gym, but it's casual enough to wear as a normal shirt too.  He can dress up his basic black suit for fancy occasions by simply adding a pocket square. This trio gives him options and are guaranteed to match any of his ensembles.   There's nothing like an amazing food spread to really get a party going. This bamboo board comes with a hidden built-in drawer that includes knives, chalk, and chalkboards to label each kind of cheese.  A rich but not-too-overpowering scent is the perfect gift for dads looking to switch up their cologne.  Socks that allow you to print a phrase or nickname on them are so much more unique than his countless pairs of plain black ones.  Dads always could use some relaxation time, and what better way to treat him than with a soothing clay mask? Trust me, he'll love it more than he cares to admit.  Get him a pair of cool Vans slip-ons that'll become his new favorite shoes.  A toiletry case resembling a mini suitcase(!!!) with a polycarbonate shell makes it extra durable during travel.  There's nothing like a brand-new pair of black and gold cufflinks to really spruce up a suit jacket.  A fancy cocktail shaker will ensure your dad is the go-to bartender at any and every party.  George Clooney's Casamigos brand makes some dang smooth tequila that dads will totally love. A smaller bottle (this guy is only $25!) means he can easily take it with him to parties and mix up some mean margs.  The black and navy hues keep this timepiece classic, while the small round face with silver accents make it sleek and sporty. If your dad is picky about which cards he keeps in his wallet, get him a slim two-toned case that fits only the necessities. You can never go wrong with a classic silver-buckled leather belt, which will instantly dress up his outfits.  This versatile collared shirt is relaxed enough to wear with jeans but polished enough to wear with dress pants.  Odds are your dad already has a pair of flannel-lined slippers that are old and worn out, so get him brand-new ones that he'll love to strut in around the house.  A weekender that easily fits a laptop and has convenient outer and interior storage pockets for all his loose items is one he'll want to take everywhere.  A silly mug is always a classic dad gift. He can "fuel" up on caffeine in the mornings with this clear glass one.

			 "It's not too hot, not too cold, all you need is a light jacket!" As a very wise beauty queen once said, April 25th is the "perfect date" for a light jacket — "it's not too hot, [and] not too cold" either. And she's right!

			 They don’t look super comfy but they’re definitely cute, so maybe they’re worth it? If you follow all the ~fashun~ ppl on Instagram, you might have noticed a certain footwear trend that has trickled down from the spring/summer ’19 runways and popped up on your feeds.  “What trend?” you ask? That would be these downright sexy “naked sandals” that are perfect for hotter temps ahead, thanks to their cool, foot-baring, minimalist silhouettes.     Every naked sandal you need for Spring 👡 #MOSocialEdit A post shared by  Caitlin Burke (@caitlinburkenyc) on Jan 22, 2019 at 1:29pm PST  One of my favorite pictures from @parisfashionweek ⚡️ 📸 by me @styleinscandinavia  #streetstyle #pfw #parisfashionweek #burberry #céline #inspiration #fashionweek #styleinscandinavia #susanstjernberger A post shared by  Susan Stjernberger (@styleinscandinavia) on Jan 16, 2019 at 9:53am PST  They’re generally defined by superthin, barely-there straps and the fact that there’s very little coverage going on—i.e., you’re basically showing off your feet more than your actual shoes. (On a related note, I hope your toes are lookin’ better than mine after being shoved into boots all winter.) They’ve also been referred to as “floss heels” because, well, some of the straps are about as thin as that stuff you tell your dentist you use everyday. (That’s a LIE and we all know it.)  
  These sandals are basically the shoe equivalent of spaghetti-strap tank tops and they seem like they’d H-U-R-T to walk in. To see for myself, I wore these Dorateymur ones in gold one day recently. They were actually more manageable than I thought initially. But I have to say, the longer I wore them, the more constricting they felt around the tops of my feet—even while just sitting at my desk.  By the end of the day, my feet were aching for something flat to wear—preferably with memory-foam insoles. However! They do make a great office shoe—aka when you keep a stylish pair under your desk to switch out of your maybe-too-casual sneakers—and the back strap made them more supportive than sandals that don’t have one. Also, if you’re looking for a cute style this season to wear for a couple hours on a rooftop bar, while picnicking in the park, to go on a coffee-shop date, or whatever else you do for a shorter amount of time in the summer, then these are definitely IT.  If you DGAF about pain and just love you some sexy shoes, shop these styles with me because they just look so summery and happy and fun!!!

			 Even royals love the Met Gala!  Every year the Met Gala's attendees include A-list celebrities, models, and fashion designers, and now, even royals are included in the exclusive mix. Princess Beatrice of York — a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth and eighth in line for the throne (just a fun fact!) — made her Met Gala debut in a vivid purple gown complete with billowing sleeves and a high neckline. And, because she's a princess, a shiny headpiece is almost required right?  She completed her look with a black clutch and metallic heels. Her appearance at the Met Gala comes just just less than two weeks from her cousin Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle.  
  The purple hue, though, is known to be a royal color, so it seems that Princess Beatrice really thought through her look. I wonder what Queen Elizabeth — who loves a brightly-colored outfit — would think of her dress?  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Once you see it, you can't un-see it. All of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters released new campaign images for Calvin Klein on Wednesday, but, um, fans are noticing a slight problem in the pic of all of the ladies together. Like, WTF is going on with Kourtney's limbs? Let's zoom in a little so you can get familiar.  Even closer: Kourtney's right arm looks like it is about half the size of her left one, yes? And the more you stare at it, the weirder it seems, because that's not how they look in real life. At first you're like, OK, but maybe they just caught that arm at a different angle—is that her wrist? But then it's like, That's a really long wrist area, if that's the case, though.  Once you see it, you can't un-see it—amiright? Anyway, here are some lovely pics of Kourtney using that arm to throw out the first pitch at a Dodgers game in L.A. yesterday!

			 She's TOO CUTE.  Eight-year-old Daisy-May Demetre is the star of River Island's latest kids' activewear campaign, and the photos are so inspiring.  In the ads, she wears a mesh white T-shirt over a sporty floral crop top and matching leggings, as well as her red prosthetic blades.  Demetre was diagnosed with fibular hemimelia (underdeveloped fibular bones) when she was born, and, as a result, both her feet were amputated when she was just 18 months old. That hasn't deterred her from pursuing her modeling goals or hitting the gym with her dad.  A spokesperson from the British retailer said in a statement to Huffington Post U.K.:  The model signed with Zebedee Management in 2017, an agency that represents people with disabilities, and she walked in London Fashion Week in February.    #Repost @minimode_lkfw with @get_repost ・・・Where it all began at London kids fashion week big thanks to them for getting my journey started 💜💜 🔥🔥SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT 🔥🔥🔥 MINI MODE, London’s Premier Kids Fashion Week is really excited to see @daisy_maydemetre_zebedee blowing up. 💥💥 As most of you know, we’re all about inclusivity in kids fashion and I’ve worked with @zebedee_management for the last 2 years now championing what they do so we’re feeling super proud to see Daisy on the @itvnews and @metronewspaper @riverisland @riverislandpr @ted.  At our Inaugural Show in February I had grown men telling me that she brought tears to their eyes which really shows what and inspiration she and her family are!! @big_al_demetre you guys rock.

Almost a year ago, Target's children's brand, Cat & Jack, launched a 40-piece line made for children with disabilities. In April, Tommy Hilfiger unveiled its Spring 2018 campaign that expanded upon its adaptive clothing options, which featured details like magnetic buttons, adjustable hems, and Velcro closures for people with disabilities. And in July, ASOS debuted a rainproof jumpsuit that is wheelchair accessible. Hopefully River Island's new campaign will push even more retailers to follow suit.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Bring on the puff sleeves, ruffles, and pleats, please.  We’re almost in October—and the crisp air and PSL mania is almost upon us—but, of course, fashion is always one step ahead. If you’re already thinking about what to wear next year, here are 12 of the biggest trends from the spring/summer 2020 runways. Some might not be that surprising, whereas others are waaay outta left field (beige...in summer?), but they’re all equally gorgeous. And as soon as spring rolls around, you’ll know *exactly* what to shop for.  Just because there’s minimal fabric doesn’t mean this style can’t be chic. From knit to snakeskin, these bras are ones you’ll def want to show off.  Bevza LaQuan Smith Cynthia Rowley  The longer, the better with this trend. It adds tons of drama, and it’s just fun to twirl around in, okay?  Area Christian Siriano Oscar de la Renta You’ll look like a marble statue come to life with this breezy style.  Proenza Schouler  Sies Marjan Prabal Gurung  The knit style is definitely not going away in warmer months, but that’s because the see-through fabric is ideal to wear from the beach to the street.  Staud Kate Spade Jonathan Simkhai You might have a black or navy pantsuit, but choose this shade to really make a statement—whether you’re in the office or going out on the town.  Christopher John Rogers Helmut Lang Christian Siriano Wrap yourself up like a gift this season with a huge-ass bow. It can be the focal point of your outfit or blend in more subtly.  Brock Collection Christian Cowan Cong Tri It’s time to live out your ’80s prom dreams with All. The. Pink. Ruffles. Just pile ’em on!  Marc Jacobs Vaquera Oscar de la Renta This bold silhouette is popular now, but according to the runways, it’ll be back and better than ever come spring. Just look at how puffy!  Khaite  Carolina Herrera  Tory Burch  Pick your fave color—and then make it extra see-through.  Sally LaPointe Zimmermann Ulla Johnson  Boring white shirt? I don’t know her. Give it some oomph with oversize sleeves, an open shoulder, or a super-cropped cut.   Bevza Pyer Moss  Helmut Lang  Give solid-colored pieces a lil something extra with this fun textured treatment.  Pyer Moss  Marc Jacobs  Jonathan Simkhai Blind everyone (in the best way possible) next season with the whole spectrum of colors.  Christopher John Rogers  Christian Cowan Christian Siriano Channel the citrus dessert in your whole ’fit and you’ll definitely turn heads.  Tibi   Christopher Kane Staud The poncho is basically the new trench when it comes to transitioning between winter and spring. I don’t make the rules.   Sally LaPointe Roksanda Burberry Become best friends with these brown tones next season because they’re gonna be EVERYWHERE.  Burberry Ryan Roche Simone Rocha The playful print gets a grown-up twist with structured silhouettes and modern details. Suddenly, I only want to wear dots from now on.

			 Are these the most versatile pants...ever? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Packing for a trip is the worst. You always end up bringing the wrong items along, the clothes don't match, or—worst of all—you're either severely under- or over-packed. (My luggage typically falls in the latter category).  One way to make the process easier? Invest in a pair of reliable, versatile jeans, like these Lee Riders Shape Illusions. They look cute on literally every body type and are just dark enough to go with basically everything you own. Pro tip: Check out the tops from the Lee Shape Illusions collection while you're at it—they're also suuuuper flattering!  In the video above, The Today Show Style Editor Bobbie Thomas shows how the jeans can be worn again and again throughout a trip. For your travel day, pair the dark jeans with a jacket (airplanes... brrrrr!) and white sneakers. You'll wear the sneaks the following day, too: with the jeans, a statement sweater, and a little backpack. Don't forget your sunnies!  Throw a cute cami and a leather jacket in your bag for your night out. You'll ditch the sneakers for black heels, add a bold lip, and you'll be ready for wherever the night takes you (fingers crossed it involves pizza)! Check out the video to see the full travel looks, and don't forget your Lee Jeans.

			 Bougie on a budget.  In case you didn’t know, Amazon Prime isn’t just for watching Fleabag and impulse buying a Game of Thrones chopping board (just me?)—you can totally use it to buy some amazing fashion. And this week, the site took it a step further, launching a service called Personal Shopper by Prime Wardrobe. If it sounds fancy that’s because, well, it IS. (But without the fancy price tag since it’s only $4.99 a month.)  You have to be a Prime member to access it (sign up for a free month here tho!) and through the service you create a style profile and fill out a survey, which establishes your personal style (duh), fit, and budget preferences. Within days, you’ll receive suggestions from your stylist—yes, they’re a real person!—and you’ll be able to choose up to eight items that will be delivered straight to your door. Yay, convenience! But if you’re not a fan of all of the products, don’t stress. They come in a resealable box with a prepaid label, so returns are simple even for the laziest of online shoppers (i.e., me).  You have a seven-day try-on period of your stylist’s selects before you return any items, and you only pay for what you decide to keep. Also important to note? According to the site, the styling service includes women’s apparel in sizes 0–24 and XS–XXL/3X, as well as women’s shoes in sizes 5–12. (Men’s clothing and accessories aren’t available just yet, but will be coming soon, JSYK.)  In order to use it, just access it via THIS LINK or search it on the Amazon app.  Prime Wardrobe has the same try-before-you-buy feature with seven days to return any items, while Personal Shopper has these same features with the added bonus of specific styling suggestions from more than half a million items. The curated selection of brands also include 7 for All Mankind, Calvin Klein, Levi’s, Rebecca Taylor, Champion, adidas, Amazon Essentials, Daily Ritual, and more.  According to Amazon, its “fashion stylists come from varied backgrounds in the fashion, retail, editorial, styling and creative fields” and “are trained to select items and styles based on fit, color, styling, seasonal and current trends.” Of course, you might not like everything they pick for you, but that’s okay! The more info you share about your preferences, the better they can narrow down what you like (or don’t like). You can also update your profile at any time.  Now shop away like the celebrity you think you are in your head!

			 The Duchess of Cambridge is a big fan of the Superga 2750 COTU Classic Sneaker. Kate Middleton has a wardrobe fit for a Queen...or a Duchess. But in addition to her crisp shift dresses and whimsical fascinators, the Duchess of Cambridge also has an enviable casual wardrobe. She's frequently spotted in jeans, tees, and sweaters—and a certain pair of Superga sneakers that retail for just $65. And today, you can score her kicks for even less: the Superga 2750 Cotu Classics are part of Amazon's huge Prime Day promotion, and are marked down to just $44.99 in certain color and size combinations. (And honestly, even if your size and preferred color aren't on sale, they're still a steal at full price.) It's easy to see why Kate loves these shoes. They're comfortable enough to walk in all day long, making them perfect for traveling, shopping, or keeping up with your kids. And they pair well with just about anything in your wardrobe, from jeans and shorts to weekend skirts and dresses.

			 And, honestly, the photos that go along with it are FIRE. On Wednesday, Iskra Lawrence posted some bomb bikini pics on Instagram. In them, she wears a simple sporty top and a pair of matching black cheeky bottoms. You can see them for yourself here:   Often, Iskra posts some kind of motivational message with her pictures, because she's all about self love. This time, she wanted to make sure a couple of underlying points are emphasized: 1. Not every single bikini post has to be about body positivity! You can post something just because you like it. 2. Don't feel like you have to post images of yourself in swimwear because other people do it, or because you think photos like that will get more "likes." Read her full post: Seems like common sense, but it's good to have a reminder like this every once in a while. Keep flexin', Iskra! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 That's ice cold, Kanye.  There’s no denying that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are a fashionable power couple, but during a discussion panel with Business of Fashion on Monday, she revealed that he had a lot to do with her athleisure vibes and more elevated — if not completely OTT — fashion that she's now known for.   “I always thought I had really good style until I met my husband, and he told me that I had the worst style,” Kardashian said. “He was really nice about it and cleaned out my whole closet. I probably had 250 pairs of shoes, and when we were done cleaning it out, I had two pairs left and I cried.”   It’s not the first time Kim has talked about her husband’s impact on her style. In a 2015 appearance on Live! With Kelly and Michael, she revealed that when the pair first started dating, Kanye and his stylist went through her closet and put aside everything that wasn’t “cool enough.” And when she walked in, it was a “pile to the ceiling of shoes.” Here's the iconic clip in question:  But for all the items he cleared out, he replaced her closet with entirely new clothes.  “There were racks of clothes of designers I had never heard of before, like Lanvin and Givenchy,” she said at BoF’s event. “[Kanye] had all these fashion books and one by Carine Roitfeld and said, ‘One day Carine will style you,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah right, I don’t know who this is.’ Now, she’s one of my good friends. I wanted to learn. I wasn’t offended when he said that. When he did that, he wanted to teach me.”  Another example of Kanye giving his expert fashion advice was when, in a January episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, he sent her an e-mail saying, “You cannot wear big glasses anymore. It’s all about tiny little glasses.”  Kim also spoke about the challenges she encountered when she first began to evolve her style. “I went to Paris and started meeting with these people, and no one would dress me at the beginning,” she recalled. She says Givenchy’s then-creative director, Riccardo Tisci, was the first person to take a chance on her and taught her about specific fits and cuts of clothes. Kim then became close with Balmain’s creative director, Olivier Rousteing.  “None of the samples would fit me, so they started to design things that were more curvy and that would fit someone who had more of my body type.” This goes to show that even reality stars and moguls like Kim have to work on finding their sense of style — but to be fair, even Kanye's fashion has come a LONG way. The couple went from this in 2012:  To this in 2018:  What a difference six years can make!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 HAPPY FRIDAY! If your workout wardrobe is in dire need of an upgrade, it looks like today’s your lucky day. Because Lululemon—yes, the brand that almost NEVER goes on sale—is offering some massive discounts right now. It’s all part of their We Made Too Much sale, which features up to 50 percent off some of their most popular clothes and accessories, including leggings, sports bras, and APL sneakers. You can even score some awesome discounts on gear like gym bags, yoga-mat carriers, hats, and more. (Yeah, now is the time to stock up!) But because there’s so much to choose from, it can be a tad overwhelming. To help you sort through all the deals, check out some of the best pieces from Lululemon’s incredible sale—but act fast before your size sells out! These training tights are made with buttery-soft fabric and a perfectly comfortable high-rise waist to keep you feeling great all workout long. This is one of the best sports bras you can buy at Lululemon, and now it’s on sale! It feels comfortable and supportive whether you’re doing a HIIT workout or going on a long run. Plus, the crisscross straps look adorable! You can never have too many workout tanks, right? This sleek high-performance tank is designed to stay put during your yoga poses, squat reps, and more. If you’ve been in the market for a new gym bag, this sleek duffel is a perfect choice for toting all your gear. It includes interior and exterior pockets for everything from your water bottle to a change of clothes. When the weather chills out, you’re going to want a shirt that keeps you cool, dry, and warm. Throw on this pullover after a yoga class or just pair it with some cute jeans for a comfy feel and stylish look. The Align Pant II is a Lululemon fan favorite (myself included). And there are seven gorgeous colors available as part of the Lululemon sale. If you’re more of a backpack gal, this pretty dusty-blue rucksack is a great choice for transporting your workout clothes, sneakers, and more. The Free to Be bra offers slightly less support than some other Lululemon choices, but it’s the perfect pick for low-impact activities like yoga and Pilates. And its pretty straps in the back will be your new fave! These leggings are a game changer for warmer temps. In fact, they’re my favorite leggings to wear during hot summer runs. The fabric is miraculously compressive and light at the same time, so you’ll feel like you’re wearing nothing as you glide through miles. This sports bra is perfect for high-impact workouts, especially for women with bigger breasts, because it offers a TON of support. And the seamless style will prevent any unwanted chafing. If you’ve been lusting after a pair of APL sneakers, now’s the time to pounce. Lululemon is offering 50 percent off these stylish kicks—and there are six different colors to choose from. If you prefer airy over fitted tanks, this one is a solid choice. It comes in three different colors and looks perfect over a strappy sports bra. If you prefer a high-neck cut, opt for this gorgeous sports bra. It will keep you covered, even during the most complicated inversion pose in yoga. A sturdy workout jacket goes a long way. This style works as a light tank in spring or a sweat-wicking layer for cooler weather.

It comes in two colors—chardonnay and merlot—costs $89.95, and is available on Amazon. The bag comes with two reusable bladders for the wine, and the place where the wine goes has an insulated pocket to keep it cool too, just FYI. Go out and live your best wine tote life, y'all, but also please drink responsibly.

A gorgeous coffee-table book is a safe bet when it comes to a present, especially if she has an eye for design. This one will win her heart and add a fun pop of color to her living room. These Lucky Brand boots are popular for a bunch of reasons: They come in tons of colors, they’re super comfortable, and they go with everything.  PSA: Metallics are neutrals! And with this news, a sleek and shiny card holder makes a great gift for your in-law. Whether she wants to run errands after her yoga class or just wants an extremely comfortable pair of leggings to wear around town, this lace-up design from Year of Ours is definitely a winner.  She’ll appreciate this candle for its heavenly notes of lilac, citrus, white musk, and patchouli—and its pretty faceted vessel.  Trainer Anna Kaiser has a slew of celeb clients including Alicia Keys, Shakira, and Kelly Ripa.

Cheers!  A cute skincare duo is an easy, inexpensive purchase that seems luxe, especially if it’s from cult-fave Sunday Riley. Her face will look absolutely radiant after she uses the clay cleanser and smoothing lactic acid treatment.  A bottle of perfume that’s not only gorgeous but also smells like lavender, orange blossoms, and musk will be her new favorite scent.  These pretty floral prints will freshen up her walls, and the wood frames will go with any other colors she has in the house.  A personalized cutting board is a meaningful present that will have her thinking of you every time she’s cooking.  Is the dog secretly her favorite child? She’ll love this rose-gold collar and adjustable leash set.  This tic-tac-toe set pulls double duty and functions as a decorative piece and, of course, a fun game. Now that’s what I call a win-win. She’ll adore this set of multicolored tortoiseshell cuffs that she can wear all together or as separates.  You can never have too many makeup brushes! This gold set will look pretty even when it’s not in use.  Every woman needs a go-to pair of sunnies she can throw on and feel fabulous. These Warby Parker’s do the trick. Give her a nice frame with a cute pic of you and your partner for a simple yet thoughtful present she can display.  Liberate her from her tangled wired headphones with these Bluebooth ones. She and her morning run will thank you. She will have the prettiest mat in her yoga class with this marble pattern; plus, it has a non-slip grip with plenty of cushion.  This card and iPhone case in one is ideal for days when she's in a hurry and doesn’t want to carry her huge tote.  This pillow, blanket, and eye mask set will make those long flights to come visit you way more bearable.

			 Where can I get these? Amid all the drama surrounding Selena Gomez's and Justin Bieber's relationship, Selena had a sleepover with a few of her best friends and was photographed laughing away in a picture posted to a few of her pals' Insta accounts on Tuesday. Other than the fact that she looked v. v. happy, fans immediately spotted that all the girls in the pic were wearing the same pajamas, and honestly, it's adorable: 
  it’s a pajama jam A post shared by  Rebeka Walters (@rebeka_w) on Apr 2, 2018 at 11:04pm PDT  Commenters wanted to know right away: Where TF did they get those jammies? Most likely, everyone assumed that because Selena is a celebrity, the loungewear would be pricey, but it's not! It's literally this ultra soft, $20 pair from Target!!! Rejoice! The set is available in five different colors, but the one that Selena's crew went with is called "Pom Pom Pink." Fun! Selena, cool if we join you next time? Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Love you, fam. If what you want this holiday season is to secure the upper hand with all your relatives—including your pets—scroll through this list of amazing finds for everyone on your list. A photo album that holds all your family portraits—and embarrassing candids—is one that you can always break out over the holidays to reminisce with everyone.  It can be difficult to find a fashionable cross-body bag that's not the size of a wallet, which is why your sis' will totally love this mini tote that also happens to have a strap. It's chic and will hold all the random stuff she keeps in her purse!  You can't help but feel a little nostalgic for the days when you built forts as a kid, so odds are your little sister would love a playhouse that she can stock with pillows and blankets and use as an escape from the world for a bit—or at least from your parents.  If your brother's old shoes have holes in the bottom and he's been too lazy to replace them, then a textured tan pair with dark brown contrast might be just the thing he needs.  Your little bro' will totally freak (in the best way) over a delightfully weird balaclava that's great for cold weather.  Your mom might insist that she doesn't need a gift every year, but you can (and totally should!) surprise her with a necklace featuring a teeny-tiny heart that she'll wear all the time.  If your dad is obsessed with tech gadgets, then he'll love to play around with a WiFi speaker. It also happens to work with the Amazon Alexa, so he can ask it to play any tune he digs.  Does your grandma make the most heavenly pie, but her baking pans are more than a little outdated? Then she'll love a gorgeous dish that's oven-safe and makes all the pastries she serves up look even more mouth-watering.  Your grandpa will love kicking back in this monogrammed, fluffy robe while reading the paper and drinking coffee in the morning. Does your uncle love mixing up a good drink or two? Then snag a modern stainless-steel cocktail set that he can use to make all those amazing holiday drinks like spiked eggnog or a hot toddy.  If she's a fan of relaxation time (I mean, who isn't?), your aunt will so appreciate a soothing bath oil that will make even the most stressful day melt away; plus, it'll make her skin so so soft.  It can be hard to think of a gift to give someone who you don't see very often, but a scratch-off movie poster seems like a no-brainer. It's interactive, it'll make them watch movies they may not have seen before, and, if nothing else, it'll look cool on their wall.  Little baby cousins are the sweetest (and they're generally not picky about presents, which is a bonus!), so they'll absolutely adore a fluffy stuffed bunny they can tote with them everywhere they go.  Odds are she has a lot of energy (oh, to be a kid again), so a classic red bike is the perfect way for her to get outdoors, explore, and pedal her heart out—with a helmet, of course!  He'll look even cuter than he already does in a tiny yet very stylish cardigan; plus, layering pieces will keep him cozy in cold weather.  If you don't know her skin type, get her a luxurious set that's gentle enough for almost anyone. You really can't go wrong with a pair of socks, especially when they have a cool pattern that differentiates them from his other plain, boring ones.   Even your pup deserves a gift for being good (well, most of the time), so give him a new turkey-shaped toy that looks deceptively delicious.  Your cat will love this half-lounge-chair, half-scratcher for its versatility, but you'll love it for its architectural shape and modern design.

			 And how many times they actually wear an outfit. Instagram influencers make so much of their lives public, but there are some real behind-the-scenes details most followers never see. Last week, I was surrounded by a resort full of these social-media mavens who attended a trip to Mexico with me and clothing retailer Revolve, called #REVOLVEsummer.  On Wednesday, we all took over a private beach cove, relaxing and splashing around in the ocean. It was amazing to soak up the sun, but I also took the time to chat with a few of these ladies about Revolve’s latest super-affordable brand, Superdown, and the side of being an ~influencer~ that most fans don’t know. Like, when do you tell your fans you have a significant other and what if, when you introduce them to your followers, they all slide into bae’s DMs? Or, how many times do you *really* wear an outfit and WTF do you do with all the clothes you can’t fit in your closet? Actress Madison Pettis, Lottie Tomlinson, and model Tatiana Price were kind enough to indulge my queries about fashion and influence—read on to get all the inside details! Madison Pettis: Yes. Lottie Tomlinson: I’m in a relationship.  sleeepy 💤 A post shared by  LOTTIE 🕊 (@lottietomlinson) on Jul 13, 2019 at 11:22am PDT Tatiana Price: I have a boyfriend.  Madison: I’ve talked to so many girls about this. I know girls who’ve had a boyfriend for, like, five years, and they’ve never posted about them—the world has no idea. But then some people like to share those moments! I personally share what I’m doing in my everyday life that’s fun and makes me happy. So whenever I’d feel comfortable sharing and Storying, I’d do that, but I probably wouldn’t do a “This is my boyfriend!” official post.  This must be the place 🕌 #RevolveSummer @revolve A post shared by  Madison Pettis (@madisonpettis) on Jul 14, 2019 at 3:12pm PDT Lottie: I think once you know it’s going to be more of a long-term thing, that’s when you do it. When you’re still deciding, getting to know each other, I keep it private then.  Tatiana: The best time to introduce a BF to your followers is during the summer—on vacation—because, you know when you go on vacation, it’s real. Three days of me, just me! All side situations, they’re gone. We’re on vacation! That’s when it becomes serious, that’s when to introduce him.   can’t nobody tell me nothinnnnn😂 . @revolve #revolvesummer A post shared by  Tatiana Elizabeth Price (@tatianaelizabethh) on Jul 13, 2019 at 7:19am PDT Tatiana: First off, I don’t tag him. I treat him more like friends and family—if my dad had an Instagram that was super low-key, I wouldn’t tag him. If my boyfriend was an influencer, I’d tag him all the time, but he’s not. I’m not hiding him or anything, but…the fans find him anyway. And they have slid into his DMs. I’m secure in my relationship—we love each other. We read them together and just laugh at it because it’s kind of funny. I don’t get it as bad as a lot of other girls do, though. I think if they’re really a fan they’re doing it in a does-he-really-love-her kind of way, trying to get the inside scoop. But it’s like, Dude…. Lottie: I once put one of my fans who had slid into my boyfriend’s DMs on my Story. I was like, “You know he’s with me, like, don’t message him!” But, to be honest, he doesn’t really get it that badly—but he doesn’t check them anymore either.   In paradise #revolvesummer wearing @loversfriendsla @revolve 🌴 A post shared by  LOTTIE 🕊 (@lottietomlinson) on Jul 10, 2019 at 4:44am PDT Madison: I’m really bad. If I photograph it and it’s a picture that got seen by some eyes, I oftentimes don’t wear it again. Especially if it’s, like, a moment for a dress, I only wear it one time. But there are pants I’ve had forever, and shoes, and bags—you keep the staple pieces around. Tatiana: I have a trick for wearing things more than once and still getting the photo. I will wear an outfit five times—around different people—in five different settings and get five different photos. I figure out which one is best, and then post that one. Like, I can’t wear this [points to her yellow tiger-stripe swimsuit] around you guys anymore, but I’ll wear it around other people. Outfits that I really, really like, I never take pictures of, so I can keep wearing them over and over again.  straight out the jungle 🦓 . @revolve #revolvesummer swim @lovewave A post shared by  Tatiana Elizabeth Price (@tatianaelizabethh) on Jul 12, 2019 at 6:29am PDT Lottie: Once you get a pic in it, you can’t wear it again. But I might re-wear single pieces, like jeans, but if it’s a proper head-to-toe lewk, just once. Lottie: I do a regular clear-out. The charity shops love me. I’m constantly bringing bags of clothes to them. Madison: I bring a huge box to my weekly Wednesday girls’ night with my friends. They go crazy. They’re swatching things, trying on, testing out, trading. They get really excited about it. Whatever they don’t want, I donate.  mamacita 🌴 @revolve #revolvesummer A post shared by  Madison Pettis (@madisonpettis) on Jul 10, 2019 at 2:47pm PDT Tatiana: I give a lot of stuff to my best friend. I also have a Depop and I donate a lot of stuff. I try to be conscious of getting too much stuff though, because I want to be good for the environment. I don’t really want to be getting things I’m not going to use or wear, so I’m selective. I’ll politely decline if a company reaches out and I’m not into their products. I pick out things I truly like, wear them a couple times, and give them to my best friend.  Lottie: I love wearing these crochet sets, like the one I’m wearing now.  They’re lightweight, you can wear them in the sun and won’t feel too hot. I’ve also got a pair of blue-and-white striped Superdown denim shorts that I keep wearing all the time. And I’m into this white jumpsuit I got from them that’s good for nights out.  I love summer 🌷 @superdown A post shared by  LOTTIE 🕊 (@lottietomlinson) on Jun 29, 2019 at 1:09pm PDT Tatiana: Silks! Silk makes you look expensive, it’s sexy—you can pair it with jeans, with any print, it works always. I have a green silk tie-front Superdown shirt I love, I actually wore it today. They also have a bandana-looking silk shirt that’s so cute. I’m also always accessor-ied out. I love full jewelry, gold statement pieces, scarves, earrings, body chains….  muy caliente🌶 . @revolve #revolvesummer A post shared by  Tatiana Elizabeth Price (@tatianaelizabethh) on Jul 11, 2019 at 12:29pm PDT Madison: For me, it’s all about minidresses and white sneakers for the summer. I have a white, ruffly Superdown minidress that looks great on my tan skin.  Madison: I just wrapped up Season 2 of my Facebook Watch series called 5 Points—it premieres August 5! The first season was so much fun and I love the cast to death.   Vacation’s done, but I’m not finished 💜🏝 #RevolveSummer @revolve A post shared by  Madison Pettis (@madisonpettis) on Jul 16, 2019 at 2:01pm PDT Tatiana: I’m just really excited to move from New York to L.A. and then I’m excited to get more into YouTube so I can get really real with people and show more of my personality. Instagram is so glam, but I want to share more of myself with the world than just that.  Lottie: I’ve got my own tanning brand called Tanologist and we’ve just launched in America in Target. That’s my biggest project at the minute and I'm so excited about it.

			 End the painful bouncing and too-tight feeling once and for all! Sports bras are comfy and amazing—except when they're not. I.e., when they're not actually supporting anything and you're 10 minutes into a run with some super awkward, wildly uncomfortable chest pain.  The only way to know you're buying a good one is to go in deep on all those customer reviews, but it can take a long time to sift through the crap to find your next workout staple. Well, don't worry about that anymore, because this list of athletic bras for all sizes from Amazon have been vetted by hundreds of reviewers and you can scroll on to see which ones best fit your needs. Welcome! Especially on women with larger busts, sports bras can create a lot of unwanted cleavage action. If that's not your go-to gym look, you'll want a bra like this one with a built-in modesty panel that still looks cute. Bonus: This bra is super supportive, even in higher-intensity workouts, and promises no bouncing. Goes up to size 50J. Notable 5-star review: Boxing, sprinting, dancing, and other high-impact sports are a breeze in this super supportive bra that works just as well as wearing two at the same time. It comes in a ton of cute colors and goes up to size XXL (40DD). Notable 5-star review: For medium impact workouts like jogging and hiking, this simple, but still stylish ombre piece seems to do the job. It comes in a variety of colors and goes from S to XL. Notable 5-star review: In my opinion, everything should be adjustable. This bra has a hook-and-eye closure at the back, and comes with straps that you can adjust to make it tighter across your chest. It also goes up in size to 46I. Notable 5-star review:   This combination of attributes is hard to find, especially for fuller busts, but this bra goes up to a 36DDD. Notable 5-star review:  Function doesn't always have to be top of mind when buying a sports bra, especially if you're more into lower-intensity workouts, like yoga. This T-back style is super cute, and comes in 14 different colors and in sizes XS through XXL. Notable 5-star review:  Mesh paneling and lots of cleavage are what this bra is about, so if that sounds like you, step right up. This style also comes in three cute colors and goes from XS to XL. Notable 5-star review: Sometimes you just don't want to wrestle with a sports bra, by pulling the tight fabric over your head and around your boobs. That's where a hook-and-eye closure can make a major difference. This style features that element, plus it's got a cute, strappy back going on and it's great for medium and low impact workouts, like hiking and yoga. Plus, it goes up to size 5XL. Notable 5-star review: The longline bra, with it's croptop-esque feel is super trendy right now and this particular one gets great reviews. It provides full coverage, features cooling mesh panels on the back, and comes in a variety of colors. Sizing ranges from XS to XL. Notable 5-star review: Putting on a sports bra and taking it off are some of the most frustrating parts about wearing one at all. A zipper-front closure solves that problem for you and this one comes in a cute patterned style and goes up to size 5XL. It also has tons of support. Notable 5-star review:  Listen, if you've already got a ton of sports bras, and you're not looking to buy more, but you want something that will improve their performance, this band is the product for you. Secure it so it lays across the upper part of your chest, and around your back—it will provide extra support. Notable 5-star review: Reviews have been edited for clarity.

			 Get dress inspiration from Hollywood’s most iconic fictional brides. Weddings are all about fairy-tale endings and love and compromising on your future in-law’s ridiculously long list of requests (no oysters during cocktail hour?! But I love oysters during cocktail hour?!). Let’s take a beat from all that noise and turn to pop culture, a place where extravagant nuptials come with no price tag and designer dresses are always accessible. It’s nice here. Behold: The most iconic wedding gowns from your favorite TV shows and movies.   Has anyone recovered from the Vivienne Westwood wedding dress Carrie Bradshaw wore in the 2008 Sex and the City movie? Obviously, the dress caused, er, complications for her and Big, but TBH, I’d choose this dress over Big any day. Miranda Hobbes always did things her own way (see: getting adult braces and eating cake from the trash), and her wedding to Steve was no exception. She opted for a velvet outfit and a bouquet of leaves. You do you, boo!  When Charlotte York married Harry Goldenblatt (you know, the husband she could have sex with), she wore this very true-to-her-character dress: classy, not too revealing, and super stylish.  When you think of Meghan Markle in a wedding gown, it’s probably the off-the-shoulder bespoke Givenchy gown that she wore to wed Prince Harry in 2018. However, her character on Suits, Rachel Zane, wore a sleeveless V-neck in her (season 7) wedding to onscreen love Mike Ross. Whether or not Robin choosing Barney over Ted (at least mid-series) was the right move is debatable, but one thing she certainly did right was this Monique Lhuillier dress. So pretty!  Ugh, doesn’t this dress (and this ensemble cast) just make you want to run away to a Greek island for the summer?  Has there ever been a more iconic television moment than Monica Geller, Rachel Green, and Phoebe Buffay lounging around in wedding dresses they bought just for the sake of it? No, I think not.  Let’s also not forgot the dress Rachel wore in the Friends pilot, when we meet her after she runs away from her wedding to orthodontist Barry Farber. Please note the fab crown/veil situation here.  Okay, I promise I’ll stop after this, but I feel like we also need to take a moment to appreciate the simple white dress and long veil Monica wore to marry Chandler Bing in season 7.  Maggie’s dress in Runaway Bride was just big and pretty enough to distract wedding goers from noticing that she’s probably wearing sneakers underneath that skirt. Hey, when a girl’s gotta dash, a girl’s gotta dash. You were probably too distracted by the Portokalos family’s antics to notice Toula’s (Nia Vardalos) wedding dress. The V-neck and the detailing were pure gold. Audrey Hepburn had many iconic movie looks, including this short satin-and-tulle Givenchy wedding dress. So. Freakin’. Chic.  I get that we’re all supposed to root for Julia Roberts in this movie, but TBH, Cameron Diaz’s fun, structural gown kinda had me hoping she’d end up with the dream guy.... After watching them flirt from their desks basically every single episode, Pam Beesley and Jim Halpert—the whole world’s fave TV couple—finally got hitched in season 6. Elizabeth Taylor’s wedding dress did not disappoint in the 1950 movie Father of the Bride. That combo of silk, buttons, collar,  and lace is everything you could want in a fictional wedding dress.  When Katherine Heigl’s character, Jane, finally gets her turn to walk down the aisle (and let’s try not to think too hard about the gender politics of this movie here), she opts for this understated and elegant gown. Magnifique!  You might not have noticed Allie’s (played by Rachel McAdams) wedding dress ’cause you were too busy crying throughout the movie, but here it is, and yeah, it’s some good vintage!  And speaking of fab wedding gowns from an earlier era, Rose’s beaded and silk tulle dress in Downton Abbey is all kinds of gorgeous.  A dress that needs no introduction: The one worn by Claire Danes in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet. Such a shame about how that marriage ended though. In season 5, Grace pulls a Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas by getting married to Leo, her boyfriend of two months. Will obvi walks Grace down the aisle, and even though she and Leo get divorced, they remarry by the end of the series.  Did Katniss Everdeen ever end up marrying Peeta Mellark in the Hunger Games movies? Debatable. But did Jennifer Lawrence get to wear a stunning, futuristic wedding dress either way? She sure did.  Say what you want about Disney princesses being bad role models for young viewers, but I one hundred percent endorse Ariel’s wedding dress as role model for wedding dresses. Those animated puff sleeves are E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.  This 1965 musical classic is great for many reasons, not the least of which is Maria’s (Julie Andrew) classically modest and sophisticated wedding dress.   Jessa from Girls (played by Jemima Kirke) was obviously never going to wear a traditional wedding dress, so instead, she went with this boho minidress for her surprise wedding in season 1.  We love a medieval royal wedding dress. I mean, that texture! That crown! Sure, Buttercup wasn’t too happy about this marriage, but at least she got to wear a great dress for a hot sec? Maybe? It’s fiction, you guys! Grey’s Anatomy’s Cristina Yang wore a crimson dress and carried a color-coordinated bouquet for her season 7 wedding.  Two other Seattle Grace Hospital doctors who looked great at their wedding? Dr. Arizona Robbins and Dr. Callie Torres, who both nailed the bridal look.  If you ever wondered what vampires wear to their weddings (anyone? just me?), it seems like they stick with the traditional suit and a white Carolina Herrera gown, as Bella and Edward demonstrated in Twilight.  Now that we know how vampires dress to get married, let’s look at lab-made monsters, shall we? According to Bride of Frankenstein, lady monsters wear flowing dresses like this one. Noted. If anyone could pull off a nontraditional blue wedding dress, it’s Blair Waldorf, who ended up getting married to (and then arrested with) Chuck Bass in the sixth season of the Gossip Girl series.

			 She’ll love them, I promise!   Purchasing a gift for your boyfriend’s mom can be a HUGE task—you’re not sure how much to spend, let alone what to even get her. Obviously, you’ll get to know her better the longer you date (she could be your future mother-in-law, you never know!), but if you’re meeting for the first time, you might be asking your BF so many questions about what she even likes.  Don’t stress just yet! We rounded up the best presents for her at multiple price points, so you can find the *perfect* item within your budget—and something you know she’ll actually use. One less thing to worry about when meeting the fam for the first time, right? Whether his mom loves to garden, try out eco-friendly beauty brands, decorate her home, or wear monogrammed pieces...here are 30 gift ideas she’ll totally love. A pair of gold hoops might be too basic, but this style, with its stone and chain details, differentiates itself from the rest of her earrings—and looks super chic. Everyone needs a reusable water bottle—it’s called being nice to the planet Earth, hello! The special thing about this one is that Mom can sip (there’s a straw!) or swig from this stainless steel double-wall, vacuum-insulated water bottle. It’s the perfect thing to throw in her purse to stay hydrated. Moms love flowers, but this will last a whole lot longer than a bouquet. Diptyque makes the most chic, coffee-table-worthy candles so you can show her you have some serious taste. Who needs a fancy DSLR camera when this guy is slim enough to fit in her pocket? It shoots, prints, and makes stickers of her photos, so it’s great for parties, events, and scrapbooking! You may have just met your BF’s mom, but this gift will instantly make you her favorite. If she’s into her skincare routine, she’ll appreciate this dose of hydration. This USDA-certified organic facial oil brings back moisture to a dull complexion and is perfect to use either daily or during flights. It’s also made without parabens, silicones, petrolatum, synthetic fragrances, or dyes, so yay for clean ingredients! Your BF’s mom might not have even known this existed, but it will change her life! In addition to the bowl, there’s an app that determines the exact food needs of her dog to help make pet care super easy. Also, the spill-proof dog design is dishwasher and microwave safe, so cleanup is simple. An extra layer is so handy to have around since fall is almost upon us. (Side note: Can you even believe that?!) This one comes in countless colors and scrunches down neatly into an included carrying bag with a drawstring closure. If you don’t know what to get her, you can never go wrong with a reed diffuser for a light and fresh scent throughout a room. It’s great if she always has people over, so she can keep this in the guest bathroom or bedroom. This trio of vases is so pretty as a set or on their own. Ceramic pieces add a nice decorative touch to any home, and these three have a unique multicolored design that looks so chic. This bold-colored passport case and luggage tag mean she’ll never lose her important items. It’s a thoughtful and fashionable gift, and it comes in So. Many. Colors. Both items are packaged together in a beautiful bronze gift box and can be personalized with her monogram. If she’s more of a gold person than a silver one, this double-chain necklace is simple enough that it goes with everything, but it’s also plated in pretty 18-karat gold. Who knew that shampoo could be...refreshing? This one has natural peppermint extract and amino-acid-based cleansing agents, which gives that much-needed jolt to wake up in the morning. It’s like drinking coffee in the shower but more, uh, sanitary. Your BF’s mom might love to throw parties, so this book is the perfect way to prep for her next event. From a bar-cart party to a holiday breakfast, this book will give her new ideas (and you will definitely be invited back to the next fete). Monograms give any gift a personal touch, and this travel jewelry case makes jet-setting with valuables chic and easy. Made from a heavy canvas material, all her items will have their own designated spot. Trust me: This is not your average lip balm. It’s a total upgrade from her run-of-the-mill chapstick that delivers rich moisture with a hint of a rosy hue. Your BF’s mom will see the difference in quality immediately, so it’s worth the splurge. She can never have enough pretty notebooks, and now her to-do lists and scribbles will look so good in the pages of these floral ones. A bold color is ideal for finding this lightweight pouch amidst all the other items in her daily tote bag. This case can carry her cosmetics or any other small essentials that might otherwise fall to the bottom of her purse. For stylish travelers, this fun marble-print hard-shell trolly is definitely a statement. There are also two separate packing compartments with 360-degree spinner wheels.

			 Your local supermarket just got a whole lot sexier. If you've seen any of Emily Ratajkowski's countless bikini looks on Instagram, you probably know that she launched her own swimwear brand, Inamorata, in November 2017. However, on Wednesday, the actress and model branched out from the swimsuit category and launched Inamorata BODY—a new line that includes bralettes, underwear, bodysuits, bandeau tops, and tube dresses.  In an Instagram post announcing the release, she called it "so much more than lingerie," and that's because, judging from the photos, you can also wear the pieces doing everyday activities, like, IDK, grocery shopping at your local supermarket.  OK, OK, so maybe not the last one, but you get it. The 18-piece line, priced from $18 to $55, includes lacy bras, underwear, and thongs, but it also offers bodysuits, crop tops, and tube dresses that are the perfect mix of lingerie and loungewear. The items are available online now, though the site won't ship them until Feb. 11.  Ratajkowski's minimal, more muted BODY collection is a departure from her swimwear styles, which are colorful and extremely strappy. But if transitional, functional, and comfortable undergarments are up your alley, shop some standout pieces from her latest launch below.

			 So. Many. DEALS. Congrats, you survived Thanksgiving and finally made it to the REAL holiday that is Black Friday. In case you just woke up after sleeping off all that turkey and pie, there are a ton of Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals happening including one from your fave retailer Nordstrom. It's happening today until Dec. 2, and has amazing deals up to 50 percent off on clothing, accessories, beauty products, home goods, and more. So basically, you better jump on all the discounts before things start selling out. (That's what I'll be doing the rest of the day, TYVM.) Scroll through for some of our fave picks from the Black Friday sale!  This Thread & Supply sweater has over 250 reviews and an almost perfect 5-star rating because it's basically a fuzzy blanket that happens to look way cute.  Capri Blue's candles are a fave not only because the vessels look dang gorgeous (look at this iridescent one!), but the scents fill any space with a heavenly fragrance.  Why choose just one hue when you can get this Madewell sweater that has three? And because they're various shades of tan and cream (aka neutrals), you'll wear this guy with everything.  The curved heel and sleek silhouette of this suede style makes them a winter staple. They also come in black leather, FYI.  Umm, a Rebecca Minkoff bag for 50 percent off?! Don't mind if I do.  Trekking through the snow (or puddles or slush) will be a breeze with a pair of waterproof boots with a thick sole for extra traction.  This personalized necklace makes a great stocking stuffer—or it's a nice gift for yourself, TBH.  While everyone is rocking teddy coats this winter, you'll definitely stand out in a star-printed trench coat that has hidden pockets and contrast lining.  Applying your makeup (or taking flawless selfies) is a lot easier with a light-up mirror on your vanity.  You've always wanted a breezy Reformation skirt, so now's your chance to snag this one at 30 percent off.  If you don't own a pair of these babies yet, they look amazing with any skirts, dresses, or over a pair of ultra-skinny jeans.  Speaking of very skinny jeans, this edgy AG  pair feel like leggings, but look like jeans. *Adds to cart ASAP.*  Need a new pair of frames? Opt for a leopard-printed pair that'll complement any face shape.  If you've been searching for that perfect New Year's Eve dress, a velvet mini with ruching and subtle sparkles might be right up your alley.  You'll never want to take this pajama set off thanks to the soft ribbed fabric and comfy drawstring waistband.  A suede mini in this warm brown shade is calling your name. Wear it with a black turtleneck and sock booties for a super chic look.  Your brows will look more defined, voluminous, and will *actually* stay in place with Benefit's popular fiber gel.

			 Her pug is not for sale though, sorry! In a surprise announcement that confirmed her new husband before anyone even really knew she'd even been dating him, Emily Ratajkowski confirmed on Friday that she'd just gotten married to her then-boyfriend of a few weeks, Sebastian Bear-McClard.  To break the news, Ratajkowski shared some sweet wedding snaps on Instagram, with the caption, "Soooo I have a surprise. I got married today." For the occasion, she'd worn the cutest mustard pantsuit (along with a very chic black wide-brimmed hat, and a small veil attached) at her wedding. Oh, and that suit is from Zara, and the two-piece retails for around $200.   As the model and actress chose the striking suit for her nuptials, it's highly likely that the items will sell out quickly. But for now, at least, both the vintage-inspired flared pants, and the long belted jacket, are available on Zara's website. While the pants retail for $69.90, the jacket is listed for just $129. Zara Flared Pants, $69.90 buy now Zara Long Belted Jacket, $129 buy now According to reports, Ratajkowski quietly split with her longterm boyfriend Jeff Magid, and started seeing Bear-McClard sometime in 2018. They were spotted together for the first time in February following a dinner date in California. Bear-McClard is a movie producer who recently worked on Robert Pattinson's Good Time. Next, he'll produce Jonah Hill's Uncut Gems.

You’ll want to wear this embellished blazer again and again! Just switch up the accessories, and it’ll be your tried-and-true statement dress. (Use some fashion tape though!) This luxe number with dotted mesh sleeves will definitely catch everyone’s attention. Combine it with a sleek closed-toe heel to look super polished. A body-hugging silver sequin dress is definitely the thing to wear when it’s the season of all things merry and bright. The polka dots on this ruched mini add a festive appeal and make it playful. Try this number with tall boots or opt for a simpler look with strappy heels. For more DRAMA, try this pleated maxi dress for a fancier affair. An off-the-shoulder silhouette always looks amazing with long statement earrings, FYI. This jewel-tone wrap is festive without being overwhelming. Give it the cool factor by dressing it down with a lug-sole bootie and a thick chain necklace or opt for block-heel sandals. Glam it up in this multicolored frock! You’ll be life of the party in a V-neck bodycon with a fun zigzag pattern.

This vibrant lace design is practically made for a holiday party. Combine it with matching red barely-there sandals to complete the ’fit. You’ll be the chicest person on the block with this sequin fringe dress. Simply throw on an oversize coat when you’re outside in the cold. If you like cutouts, get a load of this gorge green dress. The square neck and spaghetti straps make it classic, but the leg slit makes it sexy. A retro vibe in the form of this polka-dot midi with a keyhole cutout is oh so cute. Don’t be afraid to wear a standout winter white, folks! A plunging velvet number is great for the holidays and the loose bow adds an extra fun detail. This shiny dress is sleek, especially when paired with a black clutch and embellished heels. If you want a classic look, give this dress a whirl. The ruffles, one-shoulder silhouette, and low slit are undeniably elegant. If you like plaid patterns, opt for this matching drop-waist dress this holiday season. Add a classic black pump to keep the look sophisticated. Offset the long sleeves with a shorter asymmetrical hemline. The embellishments on this dress are shiny without overdoing it too. This Lurex tie-waist dress is downright stunning. (This one comes in three other sparkly shades as well.) If you like a halter, give this style a go. The lace trim at the front makes it sweet, but turn around and the backless vibe makes it flirty. Go with a graphic-stripe maxi dress for the holidays. For a tough-girl look, try pairing this dress with a combat boot, or choose a chic kitten heel to make it more dressy.

			 An investigation.  Ever since Pantone dubbed "Rose Quartz" 2016's color of the year, it's been *the* hue of a social media-minded generation of millennials, invading every facet of their lives, from beauty products (hi, Glossier!) and home goods (yes, millennial pink trash cans exist) to technology (at this point, who doesn't have a pink iPhone case?) and even eating establishments.  But I'm here to make a strong case for the arrival of what Man Repeller dubbed Gen-Z yellow — the bright, cheery color that's about to be the next big hue. It started popping up on celebrities like Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively, Kendall Jenner in 2017, and even this gorgeous ASOS model who went viral in April wore the color. And let me tell you: You're about to see it EVERYWHERE.  If millennial pink is the cool, trendy Instagram girl who carefully curates her feed by snapping pics in front of artsy graffiti walls and documenting all her lattes, Gen-Z yellow is her carefree, bold, outgoing younger sister who lives for spontaneity. She's a little more effortless, but with this bright yellow color, she obviously still wants to be noticed. Although the trend skews bright and canary-colored, you can experiment with different variations (mustard, pastel, neon, for example) and tailor the shade to suit your personality. If you're still not convinced — or simply think the color is WAY too bold for you — read on for celebrity style notes on how to wear Gen-Z yellow.  If you're wary of bright hues, start small. In the above examples, you can wear the shade in the form of shoes, sunglasses, or a bag to give your ensemble a pop of color. Rock sunny sneakers like Bella Hadid, block those UV rays like Kylie Jenner's yellow sunnies, or wear a yellow shoulder bag like Emma Stone wore on the set of La La Land (the same movie in which she also wore that scene-stealing dress). Accessories will warm yourself up to the color before wearing a full-on yellow outfit (see No. 5). $80 SHOP NOW $28 SHOP NOW $60 SHOP NOW $56 SHOP NOW Prints and accents are a great way to break up color, and although these outfits are still vibrant, the brightness of these yellows is much more subdued. Take a style cue from Blake Lively, who chose this strapless Oscar de la Renta column with an abstract, yellow-accented pattern. You also could choose floral or plaid ensembles, like Kate Bosworth and Emily Ratajkowski, respectively, featuring white and other hues to tone it down.  $198 SHOP NOW $74 SHOP NOW $395 SHOP NOW $225 SHOP NOW Another way to wear the trend is to pick one yellow item, whether it's a skirt, top, dress, or shorts, and then balance it out with neutral colors. This means that yellow can be the focus of your outfit without being too overpowering.  Beyoncé chose a black J.W. Anderson sweatshirt and clear PVC Gianvito Rossi shoes to put the emphasis on her bright wrap skirt. Hailey Baldwin wore beige sock booties and black sunglasses with her slip dress, while Kourtney Kardashian opted for a simple black hat and white sneakers.  $78 SHOP NOW $40 SHOP NOW $27 SHOP NOW $126 SHOP NOW Ready to dive wholeheartedly into the trend? These monochromatic ensembles pack a punch and guarantee that you'll be spotted from a mile away. These outfits are coordinated to a T, even down to the shoes and the bags, and are the perfect inspiration for upcoming warm-weather looks. Gigi Hadid wore a sequin Prabal Gurung dress with equally yellow accessories, Rihanna actually glowed in this yellow top and skirt combo by Oscar de la Renta, and Kendall Jenner paired her delicate, bright lace tank with paperbag waisted pants of the same hue.

			 Breeze through “adulting” like it’s NBD with these cool presents.  College was fun and all, but it’s time for you to kill it in the next phase of your life. Here are a bunch of gifts that’ll make you feel like the 20something adult you are.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! A trio of best-selling products—including wave spray, air-dry foam, and rose oil for both your strands and skin—is the perfect travel-size gift. Nothing says “getting my sh*t together” like penciling your post-grad plans and goals into a pink floral calendar. A marble cheese board will make your fancy-looking snacks seem even fancier at your next party. Plus, this one has convenient handles, so it’s easy to pick up. Want your shadows to *really* stay put? This long-wear formula ensures that all the sparkles stick to your lids and that the vibrant shade won’t fade. If you already have a post-graduation job on lock and don’t have time to hit the beach, apply this illuminating powder to your face for that sun-kissed glow. A tote bag you can bring to work that’s also stylish enough to wear on the weekend is basically a necessity. Hopefully your post-grad plans look something like this beachy phone case, but if not, at least you can carry the pretty scene with you. If you’re moving to a new place, it’ll look so much bigger (and way more chic!) with a set of four gold-accented mirrors. And speaking of new apartments, yours will feel more like home with a rosy two-wick candle to light up any room. The metal frames make these durable, but the color and round shape keep them stylish. Every woman needs a chic leather bag with a delicate chain, and although this one is compact, it still fits all your essentials. A kit that includes exfoliating body polish, face mist, and a lip conditioner not only looks pretty but will also leave your skin oh-so-soft. Upgrade your bar area with this marble cocktail shaker, coordinating tumblers, and stainless steel jigger that’ll give you a great excuse to have your friends over. A transitional dress to wear to the office and out on the town is an ideal addition to your post-grad wardrobe. Wear this with black flats to the office, then throw on some heeled sandals for drinks after. This book gives solid career advice and attempts to answer the age-old question: “How can I have a job I love that also pays my rent?” This exfoliating mask, with its hyaluronic acid and kaolin clay, is just as good as getting a professional facial in no time at all. A thin case in a trendy rose-gold shade is perfect to hold your business cards. You know, for all that networking you’re going to do. Four rings with pavé designs that you can wear all on one finger or separately will elevate your accessory game. Your fragrance collection will be transformed with this grown-up rose and jasmine scent. If exfoliating is a must in the shower, get this heavenly-smelling scrub with tropical notes of coconut and citrus. A delicate diamond pendant is a great way to say “Congrats for making it through four years of lectures, papers, and group projects!” For those post-grad travelers (or anyone in need of a luggage refresh), this lightweight polycarbonate carry-on has a hard case and a lock to protect your valuables. Not-too-high heels that conveniently slide on and off are the way to go in the workplace. You’ll look polished, and your feet will be comfortable all day. You can wear gold jewelry, like these elegant chain studs, with basically any outfit. If you have white or plain-colored sheets, the best way to add personality to your bed is with multicolored pillowcases, like these pink-and-blue ones. Cute decor, like a pink vase, will make your first post-grad apartment that much more homey. This rose-gold piece with a simple watch face looks like a pretty bracelet, but it will also help you be on time. A gold honeycomb wine rack doubles as home decor and a functional holder for all the pinot noirs and chardonnays you accumulated in college. Get a blazer that’s professional enough to sport at your new job but trendy enough to wear when you’re out of the office. If you made it all the way through college without one of these babies (they’re basically a necessity for hosting parties), you definitely need one after you graduate.

			 Honestly, it will be hard not to get these for yourself. Whether your friends are moving into a new apartment or first-time home-buyers, scroll on to find the perfect gift to fit their space. Give them a doormat that’ll make every future visitor feel at home. Everybody can use another tray for crackers and dip. Next time they have friends over for dinner, they can set the table with some elegant linen napkins. Gold candlesticks with a geometric base make for a striking centerpiece. A bouquet of fresh flowers will brighten up any of their new rooms. Nothing says “adult home” quite like eating over a placemat—a braided seagrass version adds a fun rustic vibe. Metal straws will keep guests’ drinks cold *and* reduce waste. Sweet-smelling dish soap is way easier on the nose than your typical kitchen sink soap is—it’ll make washing the dishes feel like a trip to the spa (okay, maybe that’s an overstatement). An easy-pour oil and vinegar serving set is way better than the grocery-store bottles that get super sticky. Plus, it’ll look great on the table all year round. Sure, they *could* keep their coffee beans and sugar in their paper containers, but aren’t canisters just way cuter? A striking copper French press is the perfect gift for coffee connoisseurs. Their new guest bathroom is just begging for a nice, floral-scented hand soap. Okay, this is admittedly so random, but how cute is this hedgehog toothpick holder that’s the perfect quirky tchotchke for their bar cart? A refurbished copper teapot from the 19th century will add history to their new digs. These pillar vases will be right at home on their bookshelves or windowsills. If your friends are cheese lovers, they’ll absolutely adore a copper three-knife set. Taking the cork out of a bottle after a long day shouldn’t be an arm workout. Ensure easy opening with an electric corkscrew. Gold floral measuring cups will keep their baking precise. Someday, they’ll have people over and realize they didn’t refrigerate the chardonnay beforehand. A beverage chiller will get them out of a warm-wine bind in a flash. An updated—and super cozy—blanket for those Netflix-heavy nights in. Even if your friends aren’t big mule drinkers, they’ll love sipping their favorite beverage from a hammered copper vessel. A sleek and simple spice rack will keep them organized in the kitchen. No classy bar cart is complete without a few distinguished-looking decanters. Do your BFF a favor and gift her these super aesthetically pleasing bath accessories. Way better than those plastic bottles from the drugstore. Ever try to google baking measurements on your phone while your fingers were covered in flour? Yeah, not fun. Magnets ensure that all the tricky conversions will be close at hand without gunking up their gadgets. Gift your friend the beginnings of her very own home bar, complete with an array of different glasses, a strainer, and a shaker. A marble canister keeps wine chilled while it’s on the table—meaning your host won’t have to get up and grab the bottle out of the fridge for every refill. Such a time-saver! This hamper is stylish and useful. If your friend already has a system for their clothing, they can still use it to store extra throws or blankets for the living room or guest bedroom. An accent pillow in a pretty pink color is the perfect pop of color for their living room.

			 If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em, right?  Sometimes it’s good to get a refresher of all the best, most popular clothing brands out there, because you might be like, “Duh, I definitely need to hit them up the next time I go shopping!” Of course, “popular” and “best” are subjective, but these names and retailers are pretty much universally recognizable and include the full spectrum of designs at every price point. Here, 35 of the best brands you’ll want in your wardrobe ASAP.  Daily Ritual offers simple silhouettes and ultra-soft materials so you can easily dress them up or down with the right accessories. It’s def a fan fave of Amazon shoppers—this V-neck has an almost perfect 5-star rating! You know all about the trend-driven UK retailer, and honestly, it has great pieces at a not-so-scary price point. Although its U.S. stores are sadly closing, you can still shop for fun pieces, like this pretty spliced long-sleeve, online or at Nordstrom. Ref does a breezy, printed midi SO well. (You’ve probs seen a celeb wearing one of them on Insta at some point.) The sustainable brand also has tons of other options, including swimwear, outerwear, jewelry, and shoes, so you can get a head-to-toe look in one place. It’s no secret that UO’s brand has some truly amazing pieces (the jeans are like no other; plus, they’re super inexpensive). You’ll find practical versatile bottoms, tops, jackets, and more with a bit of a utilitarian feel, like this trendy jumpsuit. J.Crew’s sister brand has a younger and more carefree aesthetic—I mean, this cute animal-print midi skirt is proof. It offers styles in a wide range of sizes, so you can find the best fit. (The high-waisted shorts are my personal fave, just throwin’ it out there.) This Austin-based workout brand has completely transformed the athleisure space. It seems you can’t go anywhere without seeing someone in the multicolored leggings. The pieces easily transition from the gym or yoga to brunch—especially its best-selling exercise dress, which just launched in a bunch of new shades, yay! Name a more iconic jean company, I’ll wait. A pair of Levi’s is a go-to for that classic denim ensemble, and the brand has a ton of styles—high-waisted, mid-rise, straight, skinny, wide-leg, boot-cut, you get it. And it also has WAY more than just jeans. Get yourself a soft tee, a corduroy jacket, overalls, or a leather moto too. FP is known for its romantic, boho vibe, and you’ll find things like breezy lace dresses, oversize knits, and tie-dye shirts there. Its soft activewear is also pretty amazing, and it has plenty of other categories, like intimates and swimwear, to shop from. You know American Eagle from your middle school days, but the brand has only gotten better thanks to its inexpensive yet trendy pieces and inclusive sizing. Its Aerie line also has great loungewear and intimates pieces that fit a range of body shapes. If you’re looking for something in a pinch, there’s no doubt that Forever 21 has what you need. The selection is massive, and it has diverse sizing. Plus, you don’t have to drop a ton of cash to snag something cute. If you’ve been invited to a wedding, you might have shopped for a dress on this very site. While it does have a bridal section, it also includes more casual dresses and everyday clothes like wraps, T-shirts, duster coats, and slips, like this printed one. One of Nordstrom’s exclusive lines, BP. is undeniably popular with shoppers because of its accessible price point and mix of designs from dressy to more laid-back. This chic lace cami, for example, can be both depending on how it’s styled! You might think of only denim when you hear “Lucky Brand,” but its Western vibes (think turquoise jewelry, floral dresses, and leather boots) mixed with an edgy aesthetic (think band tees, bombers, and camo print) means you can find more than just jeans there. Yes, J.Crew is like walking into every preppy girl’s dream. There are striped crewnecks, colorful blazers, and shirt dresses, but it also has incredible basics that literally anyone can wear, like this chambray button-down. And if you’re wondering why it’s popular, Michelle Obama and Meghan Markle count themselves as fans, so.... Like Zara, Mango is also a fast-fashion retailer from Spain that has a huge variety of designs that you can wear to the office, on the weekend, to a bar with your friends, and everywhere in between. Targeted toward the Gen Z and millennial crowds, Revolve’s Superdown line is perfect if you are into a trendy lewk but don’t want to spend all your $$$. Many designs have a tight-fitting “going out” vibe, but there are also more low-key pieces like this adorable square-neck black top. We stan a Target outfit, and the store’s A New Day brand is seriously so cute. It offers clothes in an inclusive range of sizes that you can wear for literally any occasion, like this elevated leopard-print tank and skirt combo. I’m sure you don’t need an intro to this brand, but here it is anyway. The athletic-wear company is known for its leggings (you see that U-shaped logo everywhere, right?!) and cozy styles for every kind of workout—from low-impact yoga to intense kickboxing. Sure, it’s pricey, but once you feel the fabrics, you won’t want to wear anything else. Sophisticated and chic, Kate Spade designs are always colorful and play with bold prints, like this collared knit sweater. If you love embracing bright hues (and getting a buncha compliments), this brand is worth the more expensive price tag. Ever go into an Anthro store and wish your whole apartment looked like it? Same. In addition to the cute home goods and decor, its fashionable clothes feel grown-up yet fit every kind of personality, whether you have a boho, preppy, edgy, or minimal aesthetic—or all of the above. The great thing about Zara is its on-trend clothes and the sheer volume of options available. The not-so-great thing? Because literally everyone and their mother shops here, odds are, you might run into someone wearing the same exact outfit. Oh well, at least you know it’s cute, right?  Almost synonymous with the word “America,” Polo Ralph Lauren’s designs have that classic look, like this iconic Polo Bear logo shirt and khaki shorts. From vintage-looking patchwork pieces to cable-knit sweaters, every piece has that hint of Americana. The more budget-friendly version of Michael Kors is MICHAEL Michael Kors. Because of course. You can find this brand at almost any department store, and it has fashion-forward statement pieces—like this gorge printed maxi dress—that you’ll wear over and over again. It can be hard to find brands with inclusive sizing that *actually* have cute clothes, but Eloquii is changing that for the better. It ranges from 14 to 28 and has ensembles that are perfect to wear to the office as well as a weekend brunch. Specializing in comfy knits and joggers, Lou & Grey is the epitome of cozy casual—without looking like you just rolled out of bed. So you’ll still be put-together in any of its clothes but you’ll feel comfortable as hell. I mean, just look at this hoodie and wide-leg pants combo. You don’t have to make your wallet cry to snag yourself a fire look. ASOS’s own brand is the way to go if you want a statement piece on the cheap that actually holds up, like this amazing floral shorts suit. The brand’s items are all made ethically in factories and have an amazing quality that stands the test of time. From its pants to its cashmere, it’s the perfect place to go for basics you’ll wear All. The. Time. Kylie Jenner and Cardi B are fans of the retailer, if that gives you any indication of the aesthetic. Many of its clothes are form-fitting, like this pretty off-the-shoulder dress, but the prices are almost too good to be true?! (They also release dupes at a speed that rivals lightning, but that’s another story.) Influencers go crazy for this Australian boutique, but one glance and it’s easy to see why. The pretty pieces, like this white-and-blue floral romper, are practically made to be photographed. Going on a tropical getaway? You’ll def want a beachy Tularosa dress for yourself. The brand is outrageously popular on Revolve and has tons of new pieces that trickle onto the site at an impressive rate. Need a ’fit that makes heads TURN? This well-known Revolve brand has everything: neons, snakeskin prints, cutouts, mesh, and so much more. This brand is available at almost any retailer, and you can recognize its pieces almost immediately. They often feature ruffles, florals, cutouts, and fun prints, so people will definitely take notice the next time you’re walking down the sidewalk. One of UO’s iconic brands, Kimchi Blue (which recently relaunched) is all about airy silhouettes, smocking, and patchwork that lend to its vintage-y, cool-girl look. Nordstrom’s exclusive brand has that downtown edge for a night out with your BFFs, but it does have dressy clothes too. People are obsessed with the designs on the retailer’s site, and it also has inclusive-sizing options available. The retailer’s own basics brand is SO popular on the site, thanks to its ridiculously low prices and simplistic styles that you can wear on their own or layer with other pieces, like this classic striped turtleneck.

			 Who run the world? Moms. On Friday, model Valeria Garcia walked down the runway at the Marta Jakubowski show during London fashion week, and, in the finale, she surprised everyone by opening her black blazer to reveal a breast pump under her bra.  It's actually the Elvie pump, a waitlisted item, which is a silent, wearable device for pumping breast milk that doesn't feature any tubes.  In case you're interested in more info about the Elvie: According to the product's website, it syncs with your smartphone to monitor the volume of milk and can be controlled remotely. It also tracks your pumping history each time you use it. In short, once you check on your phone that it's almost full, you can stop it just by pushing a button on your phone. Then, you can detach the main compartment from the device to funnel the milk into a bottle. As a bonus, it discreetly fits inside a nursing bra so you can pump basically anywhere—even during a fashion show.  Garcia's feat of strutting down the runway while pumping milk is definitive proof that 2018 was the year that moms owned the runway.  ICYMI: Last week, model Slick Woods revealed she was IN LABOR when she walked in the Savage X Fenty runway show in nothing but pasties and a lacy bodysuit.   A lewk, 14 hours of labor, and A king is born. This is the face of a WOMAN IN LABOR, we hold shit down most of us don’t even know how much we’re going through, I’m here to say I CAN DO WHATEVER THE FUCK I WANT WHENEVER THE FUCK I WANT AND SO CAN YOU.

			 If Kim can do it, I can do it. When Kim Kardashian released photos of her wearing Yeezy Season 6 last year, the first thing that caught my attention was the fact that she was wearing bike shorts. My most recent memory of the style had been, up until that point, seeing them on professional bikers or at the YMCA on my fellow Pilates classmates.  Fast-forward a couple years later, and bike shorts are suddenly a "thing"—nay, a fashionable trend. Although Kim Kardashian by no means started it—celebrities from Madonna to the late Princess Diana also wore the shorts in the '80s—her Yeezy campaign last year was a catalyst for their comeback.  Since then, they've appeared on her sisters Khloé, Kourtney, and Kendall; outside of the Kar-Jenner sphere, celebrities like Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski have been photographed in them. Most recently, at Monday night's MTV VMAs, Ariana Grande wore a pair under her metallic, Tinkerbell-esque dress. It makes total sense if you're into cycling or like more coverage when working out, but wearing them to award shows? This was new territory.  But it's not just a style reserved for A-list celebrities or reality stars. Bike shorts undoubtedly have been popping up all over your Instagram feed on the profiles of countless style bloggers.   Disclaimer: I've never worn bike shorts, not even for working out, so for the sake of journalism, I decided to try the trend by incorporating the tight-fitting bottoms into outfits I already owned. Although I was initially doubtful of their fashion potential—I just couldn't wrap my head around that fact that something made of spandex could be considered stylish—it was an eye-opening few days.  Day 1: Office Athleisure  On my first day, I thought I'd ease into the style by pairing my shorts with a simple white T-shirt and Keds. But although I felt comfortable—this Athleta option is SO soft—I was self-conscious from the moment I stepped onto the subway to work. They hugged my butt and thighs way more than your average denim ones would.  All day I felt like I should be heading to a workout class even though I had absolutely no intention to exercise, which in turn made me feel guilty about not hitting the gym. A domino effect of emotions, truly.  Day 2: Summery Vibes When I decided to take on this bike-shorts challenge, I knew I wanted to try a different type of look with each outfit. So for the second day of the week, I chose a floral, off-the-shoulder top and brown leather espadrilles to get away from the whole athleisure aesthetic I went for the day before. The style is inherently sporty, so I tried to offset it with summery details to make it more wearable.  I felt a little less weird about wearing spandex to work, since I was starting to get used to it. "Are those the bike shorts? They look good!" my coworker Rachel said on our way to a meeting. But I still wasn't entirely convinced you could wear them out in public unless you happened to be on a bike sporting one of those fancy helmets and reflective glasses. You know the ones.   Day 3: Here for Business OK, so this day I really decided to challenge myself by attempting ("attempting" being the key word here) to make bike shorts more work-appropriate. Kim Kardashian usually pairs hers with a blazer and no shirt underneath, but because walking around shirtless in the office probably warrants a call to HR, I decided to pass.  lululemon.com $58.00 SHOP NOW Instead, I opted for an oversize striped button-down and loafers. It seemed like a good combination in theory, but after looking in the mirror at work—I don't have a full-length one at home—I realized the outfit very much channeled Tom Cruise in Risky Business.  The gray spandex bottoms peeking out from underneath the shirt made them look a little TOO much like boxers for my comfort. So while this outfit offered more coverage, I felt even more exposed than usual. I couldn't wait for the day to end so I could rush home and change.    Day 4: Hitting the Beach With the previous day's look in mind, I decided I liked wearing crop tops best with bike shorts due to the high waist, so I went with a striped cropped T-shirt and white slides. The shirt is actually made from terrycloth, so I felt like I was wearing a cozy beach towel, and I gave the outfit even more of a beachy vibe by accessorizing with shell hoop earrings.  lululemon.com  $58.00 SHOP NOW By this point, I was even more on board with the bike-shorts trend because this outfit wasn't very far off  from what I would wear on a normal day. The fact that they all were so amazingly comfortable to wear (especially this Lululemon pair) also overruled my self-consciousness. And was it just me, or was I moving even faster throughout the day? Either way, I felt aerodynamic as hell.  Day 5: Going Out  On the final day, I made more of an effort to turn bike shorts into a *lewk* and chose a bright, printed-button down, which I still love even though it makes me look like a dad on vacation. I paired it with navy bottoms and espadrille wedges to dress up the outfit and differentiate it from shoes I previously wore. Even Cosmo photographer Ruben commented, "Awww, you actually tried!" when he saw the ensemble.  Jokey comments aside, this look was definitely my fave. I knew the orange and blue color scheme would complement each other but I was still surprised at how well the outfit came together. While it might have been a little much for a day at work, I could easily envision myself wearing this on a summer night out.  I was so inspired by this look and kept thinking of more ways I could incorporate the shorts into other outfits—until I realized it was the last day of my experiment.  In Conclusion  It makes total sense that Kim Kardashian, someone who has an infamous butt, has become such an avid fan of the skintight style. While initially I was doubtful that I could pull off the look—how could my butt possibly compare?!—and hesitant about wearing bike shorts for one day, let alone for a week, they really did grow on me. They weren't too long or too skimpy, they fit amazingly well, and they were super easy to dress up—all you have to do is throw on some wedges or heels, and you're done. After the week was up, I was glad to wear something other than spandex, but I'm not ruling out bike shorts completely. If one thing's for sure, the experiment made me think a little harder about the outfits I wear, and it's definitely inspired me to take more risks with clothes—even if that means just throwing on some stretchy shorts.

			 Zoom in to see what it is. Selena Gomez's gorgeous Coach Met Gala look was very long, see-through, ethereal, and extremely bronzed. All of these aspects have been discussed, but you may have missed this one important detail: a religious message written right on the front of her handbag. Here's the full ensemble: And here's a closeup of the bag: In case you can't read it easily, it's a Biblical passage from the book of Proverbs that reads: According to an Instagram post by Coach, this was a personal touch that came directly from Selena, and was actually embossed with her own handwriting.  Embossed by us, hand-written by Selena.

			 These aren’t THE dress, but don’t they look pretty on her? Brittany Cartwright grew up on a farm in Kentucky, but she always knew she’d have a fairytale wedding. Some princesses meet their Prince Charmings at a ball—she met hers in Vegas. In a matter of weeks, Jax Taylor swept her off her feet and whisked her away to an enchanted land full of reality-TV cameras, tequila-infused gummy bears, and goat-cheese balls. I’m speaking, of course, about the kingdom of Vanderpump Rules.  In case you’re not aware of the actual best show on television, Pump Rules, as the cool kids call it, centers around a group of friends in L.A. who work at SUR, the restaurant owned by Bravo mogul and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills OG Lisa Vanderpump. Pretty much everyone on the series has slept with each other or done some incredibly terrible thing while drunk (except Lisa, who can do no wrong … at least on this show), but the beauty of it all is that they can’t quit each other and actually exhibit some of the most loyal, unconditional examples of relationships in modern society (LOL). 
  If you do watch the show, you probably know that Brittany, now 30, started appearing on screen in season 4 after meeting Jax, now 39, one fateful night in 2015 while the two were vacationing and partying in Vegas. (Brittany was visiting her now-maid-of-honor, Cara, who had just moved there; Jax was celebrating castmate Scheana Shay’s birthday. Another cast member, Katie Maloney, intro’d the pair, and, well, you know the rest.) Brittany quickly dropped her life of bartending and beauty pageants in Kentucky for a new one in L.A., moving into Jax’s apartment just weeks later. She thought she’d make maybe one or two casual cameos on the show, on which Jax happened to be a main character. “I didn’t expect to be filmed as much as I was,” she tells me after a four-hour photo shoot with an early call time. “I had no idea I’d end up as what I am now—a series regular.” The two have had major ups and downs—including that time in season 6 when Jax messed around with a coworker and friend of Brittany’s in the bedroom next to a sleeping elderly person (whom said coworker was supposed to be assisting—you can’t make this stuff up, folks). But they say their bond—like many of the other Pump Rules’ casts’ relationships post-scandal—is stronger than ever. The proof? The gigantic princess-cut diamond in a halo setting sitting on Brittany’s ring finger after an intimate (but televised, so not like, intimate-intimate) proposal at a Malibu restaurant in June 2018.  Some fans think bubbly Brittany—who, BTW, is just as sweet IRL as she seems on the show—deserves a better partner than Jax (who also acts exactly the same as he’s portrayed by producers, down to that thing he does with his eyes, where they get really wide but also really squinty at the same time without blinking). They don’t listen to that noise, though, because after four years together, the two are busy getting ready to tie the knot in two months—the wedding, Brittany recently announced on the ’gram, is June 29. Brittany won’t reveal the dress she’s going to wear because obviously she wants to keep it a secret until the big day. (She will, however, disclose that the designer is Netta BenShabu and that the gown will be customized.) The couple isn’t even going to take the traditional “first look” photos ahead of the ceremony, according to Brittany. “The first time he sees me, I’ll be walking down the aisle,” she says.  When I ask Jax (because, yes, he was on set, too) if he’s ready for the waterworks that’ll surely ensue, he says simply, “There’s going to be a lot of emotions at this wedding.” But I fans of the show need some sort of wedding-dress fix ahead of their nuptials, so a bridal photo shoot had to happen. “Oh my god, I feel like a princess—no. I feel like Carrie Bradshaw!!” Brittany says as she enters the studio in early April and sees the racks of white dresses—she’s up early, after a late night filming Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.  Remember Carrie’s wedding photo-shoot scene in Sex and the City: The Movie? The shoot is basically just like that, only with “Hell on Heels” by Miranda Lambert playing on loop in the background. We try on tons of gowns, ranging from Southern belle to avant-garde. Brittany loves everything equally. “This is real fashion—editorial, not just regular dresses,” she tells Jax as he arrives on set just in time to eat the crispy-chicken wrap she ordered him for lunch. She’s talking about a dark, see-through gown with a massive bow that she’s wearing. “You are Carrie Bradshaw,” Jax tells her. “OMG, I have been saying that all day!” she gushes. Also on display: feathers, bows, and wide-brimmed hats—because statement-making accessories and voluminous skirts are really the only drama that’s necessary on a wedding day. 
  The whole cheating thing—and the pair’s subsequent breakup—happened at a low point in Jax’s life in 2016–2017 (you can catch it all on season 6 of the show). Things were looking up for the couple in March 2017 as they filmed the reunion episodes and revealed they were back together. But then another rough patch hit in December 2017, when Jax’s father passed away. Jax credits Brittany being by his side as his ticket out of a destructive, alcohol-drenched lifestyle. “I’m not proud of the man I was,” Jax says. “I was in a dark place. She turned things around.” They share meaningful glances with each other while talking about this period, and the energy in the room is optimistic—positive about their future. But being a couple again doesn’t erase some of the hurt they experienced. For one, post-cheating, they’ve both been inundated with hateful messages on social media, and people constantly ask Brittany why the hell she’s putting up with Jax again. “I love him so much—I don’t know how to stop loving him,” she says. “Forgiving is just how I was raised to be.” Brittany leaned heavily on Jax and her family for strength and doubled down on that sweet, forgiving nature while dealing with those embarrassing moments in the public eye. The thing she wishes people would understand more than anything? “This is my actual life—like, it’s not a fake thing!” Fans often mistake personalities on reality TV for characters in a scripted drama, and, at least in the case of Vanderpump Rules, that’s not true. Jax even says producers get a bit fed up with the cast for hanging out so much when they’re not filming, because they’re worried they’ll miss out on key plot points. (Honestly, same.) The worst part, though, she says, is watching it play back months later. Jax agrees. “Oh my god, we’d get to a really good place, and then she’d have to relive it and we’d be back in that moment,” he says. By the way, they do watch the show together, except when the episodes are too painful. “All those emotions I would think I was over would come right back,” Brittany says. To get through this kind of stuff, the pair has sought couple’s counseling and Jax also goes to therapy to work on himself. It’s been a roller coaster for sure, but “we’re so happy and excited,” Brittany says. Which brings us back to… Lots of little girls have princess-y wedding dreams and outgrow them. Brittany has wanted a wedding at a castle since she was a child—and she’s going all in on it. She’s getting married at a place called the Kentucky Castle—a sprawling hotel property that looks positively medieval, down to its turrets. It’s even in the town of Versailles, Kentucky (which, yes, was named for its French counterpart, though locals there pronounce the l’s—“Ver-sails,” Brittany says).  Let’s talk decorations: For the ceremony, think classic white elegance, especially in the flowers and other details. Afterward, at the reception, things’ll get a bit more fun and colorful, so stay tuned. 
  The only difference between the wedding of young-Brittany’s dreams and the one she’s getting is the time of year. “I always imagined getting married in the winter, but ours is in the summer, in June,” she says. (And although the couple won’t say whether or not the wedding will be televised, the show films in the summer, so…) Brittany and Jax are also going to have Twelve. Attendants. Each, Brittany tells me exclusively. “It is such a big wedding party,” she says, while laughing her infectious, rumbling laugh. “We’re gonna have 24 people up there with us!” The two jokingly wondered if everyone will actually fit up at the altar. By the way, Brittany’s bridesmaids are wearing Wtoo by Watters dresses, and her best friend from college, Zack Wickham, will be a bridesman on the big day. (Everyone from the wedding party will celebrate Brittany and Jax in Miami soon with an epic joint bachelor/bachelorette party, Brittany and Jax revealed exclusively to me.) One thing that’ll be absent from the wedding? “Drama—I don’t want any drama,” she says. “We’ll see!” Jax chimes in, to which Brittany interjects: “Jax! I just want everybody to have fun.” I can’t stress enough how excited I’ll be if this gets filmed—let’s all have a beer-cheese party!

			 Sleek and comfortable.  Emma Stone, a presenter at this year's Oscars, wore sleek, satin cigarette pants to the show. That's right, pants. It's 2018 and women can wear pants to a fancy affair.  Emma, who won Best Actress last year for her role in La La Land, paired her pants with a red jacket, which she tied off with a bright pink sash. (All Louis Vuitton.) The color combination is stunning.    The look is a departure for Emma, who usually walks the red carpet in more opulent gowns, like the Givenchy Haute Couture gown she wore to last year's Oscars. So now you know: Emma Stone can slay the red carpet in pretty much anything.

			 These will go great with your dancing shoes. If the wedding invites are already rolling in, and you don't know what on earth you're going to wear, keep scrolling for some major dress inspo. You'll stand out at the ceremony and reception wearing any of these numbers—without taking attention off the bride, of course!  Nothing says, "It's spring!" like a good ol' fashioned floral dress. This one has a subtly sexy V neckline. The best part? It unbuttons down the front so you can wear it as a duster over a pair of jeans later.  If the invite says it's casual, a sunny yellow maxi dress with tassel ties and flutter sleeves will do the trick. Pair it with a small clutch and white slides you're set.  Headed somewhere warm for a friend's nuptials? A blue patterned mini dress will definitely keep you cool. Accessorize with statement earrings and matching block-heel sandals to complete the look.  While this dress code can cause a lot of confusion, it basically means you can wear a cocktail dress, like this elegant long-sleeve one, if you don't want to wear a long gown. The bold pattern will catch everyone's eye, while the pleated skirt and ruffled sleeves make it extra fancy.  Headed to a church for your friend's big day? A polka-dot midi dress with ruffles in the skirt and sleeves will look super sophisticated—especially when worn with ankle-strap heels.  A slinky slip dress in a gorgeous shade of gold will totally fit the vibe of a wedding in the hotel lobby and reception on the rooftop.   Are the nuptials taking place next to the ocean? Get yourself a stunning halter-neck maxi dress that channels the vibrant color of the water. A pair of sandals make walking on the sand a breeze.  If it's a modern ceremony taking place at a museum or gallery, a sculptural-looking dress with knotted details at the waist is perfect. Accessorize with velvet heels in a blush tone to keep all eyes on your cool look.  Outdoor weddings can be romantic and beautiful, but they can also be uncomfortably warm. A cold-shoulder silhouette with delicate lace fabric will feel breezy in any heat.   If it's a super formal occasion, go all out in a full-length one-shoulder sequin gown with a thigh-high slit.  OK, so if it's not as formal as a black-tie wedding, but it's somewhere in between, a tiered midi dress with a cape detail is the way to go.  Yes, "beach formal" is a thing, but what does it mean? Basically, anything you'd wear to a nice restaurant or on a summer night, like this dreamy pink and white ruffled maxi dress, is a good option. Throw on a pair of kitten heels or sandals and you're wedding guest ready.  If the bride and groom aren't too fussy over the wedding attire, opt for a cute spring dress with a bow at the neckline. Beige block heels and a matching chic top handle bag make it just the right amount of dressy.  If it's a wedding held at the bride or groom's family's residence, opt for a cute yellow midi. The color will get tons of compliments, while the ruffled neckline adds an extra detail.  A striped wrap dress like this is great to wear to work and even better at a wedding, especially when it's accessorized with a woven clutch and bright yellow mules.  A sequin dress with black heels is really a classic look that can't go wrong. Add a standout black clutch and some shimmery jewelry to take the sparkly ensemble to the next level.

			 Leave it to the royal granddaughter to make a true statement.  Most of the Royal Family came together to attend Easter church service at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on Sunday (no Harry or Meghan though — here's why). And while it's always nice to see the family together, this outing was particularly special. Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank made their first joint public appearance today. And in true Princess Eugenie style, the 28-year-old wore the most unconventional Easter outfit of the crew.  While her family members, including her sister Princess Beatrice, went for more traditional coats and dresses, Eugenie went with a $4,000 Oscar de la Renta paint-splattered buttoned dress with a fuchsia Juliette Boterill Millinery hat.  Everyone on Instagram seems to love her choice, as many called it "whimsical" and "cute." One person even wrote, "Yes, Princess Eugenia’s outfit is my favorite!"  Eugenie and Jack are set to marry on October 2, 2018, just months after her cousin Prince Harry marries Meghan Markle.  The Duke and Duchess of York are delighted to announce the engagement of Princess Eugenie to Mr. Jack Brooksbank. pic.twitter.com/ct45JvDfbq Including the arrival of Kate Middleton and Prince William's third baby, the royals have a lot to celebrate this year!

			 Shorts outfits for all!  It’s almost summer, folks. You can almost taste the warm-weather days ahead, so you’re probably thinking about shorts. Which ones should you get? How do you wear them? Scroll on for plenty of styles and all the outfit inspo you’ll need. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! If summer you is all about vibrant colors, get after it in a pair of coral shorts with a tie-front waist, a neutral cropped tank, and a jean jacket. A vintage tee will never not look cool with denim shorts and classic Chuck Taylors. No better way to make a statement than to wear three pieces from a coordinating suit. This high-waisted shorts look in a pink floral pattern is sweet and dramatic. The bike-shorts look is somewhat divisive, but if you’re into it, go for it in a pair of camel-colored ones with a cropped tank in a slightly lighter shade. Top the whole ’fit off with a white jean jacket. Looking for a breezy option that will make you feel covered but still show enough skin to keep you cool? Go for a crochet tank in a sweet seafoam color that works super well with a crisp white short and slides. An ombré pair of checked blue shorts goes great with a white square-neckline top and a straw bag, if this look is any indication. Trying to get away with wearing shorts at the office? This ensemble will do the trick. Set off a pair of baggy boyfriend shorts with a coordinating jean jacket in a fun print that’ll take the simple combo to new levels. Meet your new fave beach ensemble. This crochet pair of overalls will look great with your strapless bikini and a matching pair of flip-flops. Low-key meets cute as a button with these comfy drawstring shorts and a bow-topped tank. Want something that stands out a bit more than denim and a tee? Go for a pair of embroidered mustard shorts and a blouse with voluminous sleeves. Who says bike shorts can’t be sweet? This floral pair adds a delicate pop of color to this otherwise all-neutral outfit. Lean in to the tie-dye trend this summer in a pair of shorts in the funky design. It’ll go great with the white tube top you already have in your closet and some dad sneaks. Can’t get more summery than wearing white from head to toe. This cute matching set includes a sexy crop top and a ruffle-waisted pair of shorts. Nope, it’s not a romper! It’s two pieces, which means you can get triple the wear out of this frilled shorts and one-sleeve design. What’s better than a regular pair of jean shorts? A pair with three tones, duh. Wear these with a plain cropped tee and a neutral jacket for those chillier summer nights. Found the perfect pair of vacation shorts for ya, BTW. All they need is a simple tank and you’re ready for drinks on the beach. Your denim jacket’s a different wash than your shorts? No prob. This mismatched style still works with an oatmeal shirt layered beneath. Add a li’l pop with a pair of blush shades. Hoping to create a little drama without going all out on a full look? Go for a printed pair of shorts with a bow-tie front and combine with more subtle neutrals. This shorts + tie-dye bodysuit combo = your summer uniform. When it cools off at night, slip into these blush shorts and a sweater with ruffled details at the sleeves, please. How cute is this baby-pink striped button-down and shorts look with a camel-colored crossbody and black slides? A dressier shorts look you need in your life: a white-and-tan striped linen design with a silky matching tank and neutral heels. Just FYI. Wanna wear some shorts out? Great. Pair these white paperbag ones with a balloon-sleeve crop top and flatform gladiators. Doesn’t get comfier than a knit bralette and ultra-soft tropical-print shorts paired with Chuck Taylors. Frilly meets sporty with this pair of scallop-hem cargo shorts. Pair with a crewneck sweatshirt to balance out the twee and get all the compliments. Classic summer outfit alert! Can’t go wrong with a yellow halter, a pair of shorts, and a straw bag. Wanna test out the new Bermuda shorts trend? Start simple with a knee-length pair, a white tank, and a black leather belt bag. Is the weather even warm if you don’t break out your short-eralls and white tee? Answer: no. The fall/winter trend of wearing snake-print everything is going nowhere come summer, BTW. Stay with it in a pair of shorts with the design. Complete the look with a brown tank and coordinating heels. For any cooler nights during the season, it’s good to layer. This double-denim style gets cozier with an oatmeal sweater over the top. Love your neutrals? Go all out with a chunky turtleneck, a pair of tie-dye cargo shorts, and some flatform slides.

Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, and Laquan Smith leaned into tinted plastic shoes for spring. Try these blue plastic slides on for your next night out. Punch up your ensemble with a pop of sunshine yellow on your feet. Plastic doesn't have to mean sky-high heels—this pair is modeled after combat boots. Marc Jacobs, John Elliott, Romeo Hunte, and more were big into cobalt blue for the season. Rock the shade in a criss-cross detailed flat sandal. Resist the rain in a trendy-hued, weather-proof pair if chelsea boots. Keep it super casual in a logo-embellished pair of blue sandals that you can easily slip on and off. Prabal Gurung, Christian Cowan, and Pamella Roland all showed feathery heels on the runway. Keep it simple, yet still fun, with a simple pair of neutral heels with a fluffy feathered strap.  Go profesh in a pair of tweed loafers with feathered tassels Give off all the sexy vibes in a pair of tiered feathered heels.

Comfort is key with these retro-looking tennies in the color. Walking around in these strappy slides with a gold heel will elevate any springtime look you wear. Longchamp, Coach 1941, and Lou Dallas added lots of fringe to the footwear in their shows.  Make your sensible work shoe into a statement piece with this fringey design. Wear this tasseled pair to go from regular heels to dancing shoes in no time flat. Take the woven leather trend up another notch with this option that has a raw, fringed trim.

Nothing like a pair of neon orange dad sneakers. The highlighter-yellow wedges you never knew you needed, right here.

			 Wow, these retro shoes are SO good.  Whether you’re a fan of Stranger Things or just love looking at the nostalgic fashion  (or both!), listen up. Nike just teased a new collection inspired by the Netflix sci-fi show, and it’s officially launching June 27. The footwear brand is often used in the show (1985 was a big year for both Nike and the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, apparently), so it makes sense that they’d lean into the retro aesthetic of its Cortez, Blazer, and Tailwind styles for this capsule.  
  SHOP SOON But it doesn’t include justshoes! According to the brand’s website, there are also sweats and T-shirts that channel the vintage look of an ’80s gym uniform. The first drop incorporates green and orange hues (the colors of Hawkins High School, FYI) along with its tiger mascot, while the second drop arrives July 1 and has an Americana vibe of red, white, and blue.  Season 3 of the show also happens to drop on July 4, so you can get a new pair right before you’ll be glued to your laptop screen binging the whole series. And who knows? Perhaps Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Eleven, Max, and maybe even Chief Hopper will all be sporting them on the season premiere.  Until then, here are more pics of the gear to get you psyched for Stranger Things:

			 The classic rain boots will all be under $45. Just in time for April showers, Target just announced its latest design collaboration. This one's with Hunter, the British heritage brand founded in 1856 famous for its rubber Wellington rain boots. "Hunter has long been regarded for its impeccable design aesthetic, rich heritage and playful spirit, and based on our research, it's a brand our guests know and love. So a pairing between our two brands made perfect sense," Mark Tritton, executive vice president and chief merchandising officer at Target, said in a statement. "From the very beginning, we worked with Hunter to develop a well-designed, affordable collection that's all about fun, optimism and accessible adventure for the entire family. The colorful, all-weather pieces found in this line are made for enjoying the outdoors—rain or shine—on any budget." Launching on April 14 at select Target stores and Target.com, the collection will include more than 300 items of apparel and accessories for adults, children, and toddlers and will range in price from $5 to $80, with the majority of the collection costing less than $30. The famous Hunter Wellies will retail at Target for $45 and under, a drastic price cut from the brand’s $150 original style of rain boots. “We obviously wanted to ensure that a tall Wellington boot was included in the collection, but it was important for us to create a boot that was unique and exclusive to the partnership — a boot created in such a way that would make it as accessible as possible in terms of price,” Hunter’s Creative Director Alasdhair Willis told PEOPLE. “We are delighted with the result: a boot that carries references from our Original boots, but is truly a one-off to celebrate the partnership with Target.” The collection will also include home and garden products, too, including a number of firsts for Hunter, like hammocks, sunshades and coolers. REDcard holders will get early access to select styles and colors from the collection online starting April 7. SHOP SOON

			 You won’t want to take them off, tbh.  IDK if you’ve heard of Allbirds, but in case you’ve somehow missed that they’re A Thing, let me fill you in. The three-year-old footwear brand uses natural materials like wool and tree fibers to make its minimal, seamless-looking designs. (Even your fave Leo DiCaprio loves ’em!)  Time magazine dubbed them “the world’s most comfortable shoes,” and the thing is, that isn’t hyperbolic at all. After testing one of the brand's most popular styles, “The Wool Runner,” I can confirm they are soft as hell.    For starters, they’re super cushiony: My walk had an extra bounce with each step, and it felt glorious. And although the sneaks retail for $95, which might seem pricey, the all-day comfort you get from wearing them is worth the splurge. One pro tip: They only come in whole sizes, so if you’re in between, buy a half-size up. Some other cool features: However, just because they’re sneakers doesn’t mean they’re necessarily for hardcore workouts or runs. If you’re an avid runner, you’ll still want a pair of shoes designed just for that. You can still be active in Allbirds, but they’re meant to be more of an “everyday” shoe. Wear them running errands, going to brunch, or on days when you know you’ll be on your feet most of the time, and let your feet live their best, most comfortable, blister-free life.

			 You’ll never have to worry about flashing anyone ever again!    I live life on the edge—and by that, I mean I’m all about wearing dangerously short dresses. But holding the fabric down white-knuckle tight at the slightest breeze to avoid publicly flashing everyone is the opposite of fun. Are you reading this and thinking, Omg, same? Hear me out. A couple weeks ago, I saw this pic of Irina Shayk wearing this ’fit in New York City that totally gave me the solution I didn’t even know I was looking for:  In the pic, she wore a Reformation dress with a pair of black bike shorts underneath. And I was blown away by the sheer genius?! It was so simple. To think she didn’t have to worry about any potential complications (wind! stairs! picking up your dropped phone!). I sometimes wore, like, Soffe shorts (#TBT) under my dresses in elementary school for these same reasons,  but they were not at all meant to be ~seen~. Shortly after I saw this pic, I was perusing Free People’s website and saw the same styling concept again:    That sealed the deal. I was officially on board with the bike-shorts-under-minidresses train. This type of short has been trending since last summer, usually as bottoms worn on their own. But there are some dang cute ones that really serve as an extension of your dress. They complete your ’fit and look purposeful when peeking out from the bottom—i.e., not like you’re trying to cover up. So now you can step out in your shortest mini and be totally stress-free. I tested it out for myself, below, and now I never want to wear anything else. I fell absolutely in love with these leopard-print ones from Onzie (they are so soft!!!). I paired them with an old Urban Outfitters dress that was short to begin with and then shrunk even more in the wash—love when that happens! After that incident, I thought it would forever be put into the “Maybe I can use it as a pool cover-up?” category, but these bike shorts totally rescued it.   Also great news? You can Sit. However. TF. You. Want. No more keeping your knees glued together or crossing your legs to prevent your underwear from showing. With these babies on, you can sit crisscross! Sprawl your limbs out! Manspread! (On second thought, maybe not, but you get my point.) It is very freeing, and I highly recommend.  Also, if you’ve ever been in the nightmarish dilemma of trying to ride a bicycle with a dress on, consider that problem solved too. Taking my Schwinn for a spin is so much more enjoyable now that my outfit is “accidental flash” proof. Because your mode of transportation shouldn’t have to dictate what you wanna wear, right?     Next up was this Free People dress I bought on sale, but because of its tent-like shape, any nearby air movement would shoot the hem sky-high and give me a heart palpitation. (I did not consider this when I purchased it because I was blinded by the good discount! I have my flaws!) But with a pair of black lace bike shorts that subtly peeked out from below the hem, I had a newfound confidence wearing it.  Yes, they’re sheer, but wear ’em with solid black or neutral underwear, and it all kinda blends in and you still get more coverage. Or you can def opt for a more solid pair, if that’s your speed. Last but not least was this number I rented from Nuuly by the label dRA. I thought it was dressy enough for work, but in my building, there are steep escalators you have to ride in the lobby to make it to the elevators. So to avoid the potential crisis of inadvertently flashing a boss on my way in, I came up with the following combo: these lace-trim burgundy bike shorts that matched the print of the mini.  
  So NOW, if you’re convinced of the life-changing magic of wearing fun shorts under minis, you can shop even more of ’em below!

			 She stars in the publication's March issue.    Kim Kardashian is on the cover of Vogue India's March issue, and on Monday she shared images from the shoot on Instagram. But some Twitter users feel the reality star and business mogul is the wrong choice for an Indian publication.  We have so many GORGEOUS Indian women who could be on the cover of @VOGUEIndia but you put Kim Kardashian on there. In 2018. Newp If @VOGUEIndia wanted to feature an American celebrity, any of these women would be awesome: @rihanna and @fentybeauty , @mindykaling for @WrinkleInTime , the cast of @theblackpanther ... The list is literally endless when will @VOGUEIndia ever learn that Indians, especially young Indian girls, want to see more faces that they can relate to? We see enough of the Kardashians/Jenners around the world. Why not use Indian models? pic.twitter.com/r6cj2MY8eZ I can’t believe @VOGUEIndia featured Kim Kardashian on their cover as if we don’t see her featured on a different magazine every day. India’s vogue should embrace and feature their own south Asian women instead of choosing someone from pop culture Fans are pointing out that in one of the photos, Kardashian wears a traditional lehenga, which is a type of long, embroidered skirt.   Umm Kim k for vogue India? Wearing a lehenga ? 🙃  But some users are defending the magazine's choice to feature her on the cover. Don’t understand the hate on @VOGUEIndia for featuring an international figure for business purposes once in a while. Doesn’t make them appreciate Indian or Asian women any less people who are hating on @VOGUEIndia for their select international cover stars every once in a while really don’t understand how magazines work Vogue India experienced similar backlash when Kendall Jenner appeared on the magazine's May 2017 cover. At the time, publication released a statement on Instagram defending its position, saying in part: "In the last 10 years, Vogue India has had only 12 international covers, including Kendall Jenner, in 2017. Therefore, statistically, 90 per cent [sic] of our covers are Indian! And we are proud of that," it read.   Kardashian has not yet commented on the controversy, but in the interview she spoke about the success of Keeping Up With the Kardashians and revealed what she liked most about each of her family members — including her "perfect" mom, Kris Jenner. “The saris, the jewelry, the clothes — everything was so beautiful!” she said about the shoot.

			 It’s right around the corner, people! Also, Harry Styles is going to be there.... The Met Gala is less than a month away (side note: Anyone else feel like last year’s gala JUST happened?!), and that means you’ll be seeing all your fave celebrities in wild, OTT getups together very soon. And most likely, Rihanna will shut down the red carpet—remember her iconic papal look from 2018?!  Scroll on to find out everything you need to know about this year’s party, including who’s cochairing (great news for One Direction fans and Little Monsters, FYI) and what kind of looks to expect (spoiler: It’s probably a LOT of Gucci).   The Met Gala always takes place on the first Monday in May—in 2019, that date is May 6.    “Camp: Notes on Fashion” is the theme but, um, what exactly is “camp”? Good question. It’s based on writer Susan Sontag’s 1964 essay titled “Notes on ‘Camp.’” “The essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration,” she wrote. Andrew Bolton, curator of The Costume Institute (aka the person who basically runs the Met Gala alongside Anna Wintour) explained it a little further in an interview with The New York Times:  
  Gucci’s creative director Alessandro Michele, Harry Styles (yes, who starred in the brand’s September 2018 campaign featuring cute baby farm animals), Lady Gaga (who’s fresh off her Oscar win), Serena Williams, and, like every other year, Vogue’s own Anna Wintour are cochairing the event.   So what is the "host committee?" While it's not exactly the entire guest list, it does give us a glimpse of who's coming. Apparently, there's a whopping total of 183 people in this group, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Power couples like Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively and Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra are included, so you'll definitely see them on the gala's red carpet. Beyond the celebs though, designers like Tom Ford, Donatella Versace, and Clare Waight Keller will make an appearance. Also on the list? Carolina Panthers' quarterback Cam Newton and tennis superstar Venus Williams. (So yes, sister duo Venus and Serena will be both be there!)  The camp theme seems to embody loud, over-the-top fashion that makes a sartorial statement about art, pop culture, or even politics, and since Michele, mentioned above, is a cochair, it’s likely that many guests might wear his designs.  This coat from Gucci’s latest runway show was cited as an example of camp by Vogue, FYI.  Also, judging from this behind-the-scenes look on the Met’s Insta, those viral Viktor and Rolf haute couture dresses—which channeled so many relatable moods—will be making an appearance, and I’m high-key hoping someone wears this incredible dress.    According to Vogue, there will be 200 pieces in the show (for context, last year’s Heavenly Bodies exhibit had about 150 ensembles, according to the museum’s website), which will include men’s and women’s clothing, sculptures, paintings, and drawings—some dating back to the 17th century. Also included in the mix? Bjork’s infamous swan dress she wore to the 2001 Academy Awards.  Off-White and Moschino were two designers mentioned in the Met’s announcement post; other possible designers that will be represented include—you guessed it—Gucci, as well as Balenciaga, Comme des Garçons, Yves Saint Laurent, and Marc Jacobs.  
 According to THR, tickets to this year’s gala are selling for $35,000, and tables are priced at $200,000 and $300,000. So theoretically, yes, you CAN snag a ticket, but financially, that depends on your bank account—and how much you're willing to drop to spend the night with all your fave celebs in one room. But, of course, all the proceeds from ticket sales goes to the Costume Institute.  “Obviously it helps that well-known names draw attention to not only the gala but also to the exhibition and to the museum," Anna Wintour told the publication. "For all the starriness of the names on that one night, we never lose sight of the fact that the aim of the gala is to raise funds for the Costume Institute, so we can support its place in the cultural life of New York City and beyond.”

			 A very ~naked~ look.  You're probably aware of what a “naked dress” looks like, but let Emily Ratajkowski introduce you to the “naked top.” Scroll through her latest Instagram photos, because the star posted a few pics of her artfully constructed Paco Rabanne top.    The designer number came in a shimmery metallic fabric with fringe details on the front, while the back was just two silvery straps holding the whole thing together. It appears Emily was loving her barely-there look as she took several bathroom selfies.  The best image has to be this snap, where she showed off her full top, trouser, and heels ensemble, in front of a Rolls-Royce no less.   If Emily's convinced you that a backless, silver top is must-have party attire, shop similar pieces below. h:ours, $148 SHOP IT 8 other reasons, $89 SHOP IT Forever 21, $47 SHOP IT Nasty Gal, $22 SHOP IT

			 Great princesses dress alike. Meghan Markle's Stella McCartney reception dress isn't just going on sale; it's already being worn by other royals...or at least a very similar style to it. Princess Sofia of Sweden attended the Polar Music Prize award ceremony yesterday in an emerald sleeveless halter-neck gown. Her hunky husband Prince Carl Phillip and sister-in-law Princess Madeleine walked the carpet with her.  Sofia's dress is a little more fitted than Meghan's loose white version, but you know what they say: great minds think alike (and great princesses dress alike). The Meghan Markle effect is real: Over in the U.S., a limited quantity of Stella McCartney's 46 replicas of Meghan's dress, in white and black, will be available by appointment at the house's New York City Madison avenue boutique starting Monday.

Find inspiration with these 32 gift ideas he'll love ranging from headphones to skincare products to a coffee mug with a bad dad joke.  Love Cosmo as much as your dad? Subscribe here! If breakfast foods are his absolute fave, he'll adore this easy-to-use waffle maker, so he can make mountains of fluffy goodness for himself—and the whole fam if you ask nicely.  Bring the experience of a flight of beer home with this rustic holder. He can label it with the included pencil, and it also holds the caps so he can see exactly which one he likes best.  A portable speaker that has a 100-foot Bluetooth range is one he can bring with him everywhere, whether he's headed to a friend's backyard party or the beach (don't worry, it's water-resistant too!).  Slim straight chinos are a must in any guy's wardrobe. He'll love the versatility that these blue ones have, since they're low-key with sneakers and a tee but can also be dressed up with a blazer and leather shoes.  Does he practically live at the golf course? A set of golf accessories that includes an iron cleaner and divot tool will be super useful—especially when he can clip it right to his bag.  Whether he's a novice or an expert at doing his hair, this flexible paste holds any style without that weird crunchy feel. Once he uses this formula, he won't want to go without it.  Facial hair can require as much maintenance as, well, the hair on his head. His beard'll feel well-groomed, moisturized, and oh-so soft with just a few drops of this.  Less intimidating than a traditional blower, this handy gizmo will help him style and dry his locks at the same time. A brew-your-own-IPA-kit is the perfect gift for dads who love both DIY projects and beer. And after he brews his own IPA, he can keep it cold and take it on the go in this 16-ounce pitcher.

Jazz up his sock collection with some fun patterns and a neutral black, white, and grey color scheme that'll go with everything.  Jet-setting dads will love a convenient carry-on with interior pockets, an expandable design, and a long shoulder strap. This style also happens to make a great gym bag as well.  Odds are your dad already has a bar area where he keeps his liquor, but a swanky crystal decanter will keep his spirits fresh and doubles as decor.  He'll definitely appreciate a mug with a good dad joke.  He'll feel completely rejuvenated with a simple skincare kit, complete with a grapefruit cleanser and face and lip moisturizers.  Summer's almost here, so there's no better time to gift your ol' pop a fun vacation shirt with embroidered hang loose and peace signs.  A perfectly-sized bag that's already filled with TSA-friendly goodies like a mini body wash, shave gel, and post-shave balm is a must if he's constantly traveling.  Almost everyone by now has Apple AirPods, so get him on the bandwagon with this pair.  A sleek gray and brown timepiece with two subdials that also display the date will become dad's go-to.  A Google Home Mini will answer his questions, control his music and entertainment systems, and entertain him with fun trivia games.  Finally, he can toss his old, worn-out slippers in favor of new ones that he can wear around the house *and* outside, thanks to a durable rubber sole.  With notes of lemon, basil verbena, and ambertonic, this citrusy, aquatic scent will be his new go-to cologne.  He'll love this luxe pajama set's soft, lightweight fabric and slightly slouchy style so much, it might be hard to get him to wear anything else. He'll look super cool in a pair of tortoise-shell sunnies with round frames.  He'll look so trendy with a sporty pair of Stan Smiths that have navy accents.  If your dad doesn't like to carry a bunch of cards with him, transform his wallet situation with a slim leather case.  If your dad has a lot of OTT printed ties, buy him a classic gray one that'll make any of his ensembles look so modern.  Treat your dad to a pair of sleek yet comfy sneakers he can wear when he hits the gym or when he's out running errands.

			 Definitely wearing these outfits this summer.   T-shirts are a must in anyone's closet. They're a great option if you're looking for a low-key vibe, but you can also dress 'em up too! Also, have I mentioned just how comfortable they are? There's no need to deal with buttons or hook-and-eye closures either since you just throw them on right over your head. Easy! But not so easy? Figuring out what to wear yours with besides a good ol' pair of denim jeans. If you need some more styling inspiration, take a cue from these celebs and influencers who proved just how versatile regular tees can be. 
  Model Paloma Essler gives her athleisure 'fit a glam twist with the help of a quilted clutch and matching high heels. Style it with a scoop neck white tee to emphasized her necklace and finish it off with hard-to-miss earrings.    A T-shirt with the shorts might read too casual depending on where you're headed, but adding a blazer and two-toned heels definitely elevates the whole ensemble, like Rihanna did here.    If you're all about match-y pieces, pairing a graphic tee with a coordinating blazer and short set à la Bella Hadid is definitely up your alley; plus, it'll take you, like, five minutes to pick it out and put it on. Accessorize with chunky white sneaks, and then throw on a bold crossbody and sunnies on your way out the door.    Another cute way to dress up a simple tee? Wear it with a metallic pleated midi, mules, and statement silver jewelry like Laura Harrier, and you'll literally glow.  
 Candice Huffine looks edgy yet insanely chic in this ensemble. A striking leopard-print jacket and patent leather pumps are sophisticated, while the black slouchy tee and skinny jeans make it not overly fancy. Genius.    If you want to go for more ~drama~, how's this for ya?! Camila Coehlo wears her white tee with a lace bustier, straight-leg jeans, hot pink heels, and an evening bag that makes this look anything but boring. The pop of color really emphasizes your footwear, while the bustier gives the shirt extra interest.    Keep all the attention on your colorful suit by wearing a simple white tee underneath, like Aimee Song here. Want to make it even more trendy? A pair of thick-soled sneakers will do the trick (although you'd look just as good wearing some kitten heels with this look too).    Take some advice from Hailey Bieber and give a T-shirt dress a try with fishnet tights and combat boots. Like, damn does she look cool, right? Pro tip: You can purchase a tee in a larger size (or even a men's size) to make the hemline longer or opt for one that's specifically designed to be a dress.    A pair of polka-dot overalls adds plenty of fun to a basic black T-shirt. Also, you'll strike the perfect balance of playful and stylish if you accessorize with sporty kicks, a sleek crossbody, delicate jewelry, and trendy oval sunglasses—i.e., you won't look like a 5-year-old during recess.    If you simply knot your graphic tee in the middle, like Ashley Graham here, it transforms your whole vibe. When worn with a form-fitting skirt with a slit, white-hot boots, a belt bag, and cat-eye sunnies, you'll have a totally sexy, retro ensemble goin' on.    If there's anything we learned from Queer Eye's Tan France, it's the art of the French Tuck, demonstrated by Emma Roberts. Especially if your tee is slightly oversized, this simple trick makes it look more polished. Wear it with distressed jeans, high-tops, and a gold-accented top handle, and you'll look put together whether you're going on errands for the day or heading out for a night with your friends.    You've seen midi leopard skirts EVERYWHERE, and they're not going away anytime soon. Trust me. Since the pattern features neutral hues, you can wear it with any T-shirt, no matter the color. Go all out with a belt bag and striped shoes and you'll definitely have an eye-catching lewk.    Here, Selena Gomez goes with the classic jeans and white tee ensemble, but green-tinted sunnies and subtly metallic sneakers keep it from feeling snoozy. Opt for step-hem jeans (i.e., when the hems aren't even) for skinny jeans that have just a *little* something extra.

			 Meghan is ready for spring! Meghan Markle went out in public again on Wednesday, which means we all get to stare at what she wore! This time, because it was reportedly 77 degrees in London (um, jealous!), she slipped into a white, striped Altuzarra dress that was absolutely perfect for spring: She paired the look with a contrasting black blazer by Camilla and Marc, strappy black heels, and a black-and-white Orton bag. It. Was. Stunning. More pics, because, obviously, that's what everyone wants: Did I mention Harry? Well, he was there too. He wore a gray blazer — fun! BACK TO MEGHAN AND THIS OUTFIT: Have you seen the dress without the blazer? Look at these funky straps! Meghan's exact dress costs $1,995, which is honestly a lot. But if you're into her stripe look, and want it for less, shop the fun alternatives below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 RIP, but also...who cares? This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. If you're a lingerie lover, there's no way you haven't heard that Victoria's Secret has been in trouble for quiteeee some time now. There's been a steady decline in their sales for years now, their chief marketing officer made heinous comments about transgender and plus-sized women, and people have shamed the brand for a lack of body diversity for, oh IDK—forever! Which is why you, reader, will likely be interested to hear that Victoria's Secret is officially canceled....well, their annual fashion show is, anyway. Fortune reported that CFO  Stuart Burgdoerfer confirmed that the VS Fashion Show will not be taking place this year in a move to “evolve the messaging of [the company],” which allegedly has nothing to do with their dismally low show ratings last year at all! “We will be communicating to customers, but nothing similar in magnitude to the fashion show,” he added. If you're scratching your head and thinking, Wait, didn't this fashion show cancelation news come out before?, you are totally right! Shanina Shaik, VS pro, accidentally let it slip over the summer that the show is canceled during an interview with The Telegraph. Her actual words: “Unfortunately, the Victoria’s Secret show won’t be happening this year.” A little awkward that Victoria's Secret didn't get to break the news, but in the grand scheme of things, it didn't really matter ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Shaik added: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to rewatch the Savage x Fenty fashion show for the millionth time. Ciao!

			 Naturally, this jacket is already sold out. Meghan Markle graced the world with her presence in public on Thursday wearing a navy coat, black pants, a white, high-neck sweater, and black pumps. The outfit looked fabulous, as you can see below: Oh, Prince Harry was there too, BTW.  Of course, upon seeing Meghan's fashionable display, everyone, everywhere, wondered where everything was from — maybe that's even why you clicked on this very article! Well, you're too late. The J. Crew coat is sold out, and it's a tragedy because it was so cute with its white trim and tied belt.  Luckily, some of the other things she wore are not out of stock. Her black cigarette pants by Alexander Wang are still available, as is her fab sweater from All Saints. Her handbag, the Mini Braided Top-Handle Saddle Bag in Blue from Altuzarra, is also still around, just like her go-to Manolo Blahnik pumps. You're still upset about the jacket. I hear you. So here are some other wool coats with contrasting details that are kind of like it!

			 Didn’t think I’d find my new favorite bra, but here I am.   If you missed the initial news that Kim Kardashian launched a bunch of basics under her new shapewear line, SKIMS, here’s your reminder! The Cotton Collection, which includes cozy-looking lounge pieces, bras, and underwear, launched in October and items were just restocked last week. But how good are they really? Cosmo’s fashion team (hiii!) tested out some styles from the 14-piece line, which ranges in size from XXS to 4XL and is available in five hues: Bone (white), Soot (black), Iris Mica (pale purple), Mineral (pale blue), and Kyanite (teal).  I am so excited for the @skims cotton collection to launch this Tuesday. It’s the most comfortable every day bras and underwear in all of the tones I love! The comfy basics! I’m wearing the @skims Cotton Underwire Bra ($48) in kyanite, coming soon in 31 band and cup sizes. Shop the Cotton Collection on October 15 at 9AM PST / 12PM EST and join the waitlist now at SKIMS.COM to be the first to shop. A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 12, 2019 at 7:47pm PDT I am SO impressed with this bra. I was expecting it to fit weird and gape (since most of my bras do lol), but the underwire that runs through the center forms right to your chest and I didn't see any annoying lines through one of my tightest shirts. It's also padded just the right amount so nothing feels like it's digging into you, but I just wish it was tagless in the back!  I was a big fan of this tank, and while I got an XS, I probably would've ordered one more size up for a looser fit. It is cropped, so if you prefer more coverage, I'd go with the T-shirt instead. It wasn't as stretchy as I thought it'd be, TBH, but it's definitely a lounge staple that is functional in public, too. I could totally see myself wearing this with a pair of high-waisted shorts come summer.  Not everyone is a boxer-brief kind of person, myself included. While I loved the concept, it was n-o-t flattering on me and I found that the elastic waist wasn't the most comfortable material if you're supposed to be lounging or going to bed in these. But I *will* say the fabric was super soft and also thick enough so you wouldn't see anything through them, even in this light lilac shade.  This. Bra. Is. Awesome. It is comfy, the straps are wide (but not in a dumb old-lady bra way) which means extra support. I loved that it wasn't padded, but instead was double-lined. Meaning: Nipples don't poke through, but the cups still give great shape without adding extra bulk. This is my new go-to, everyday bra! One complaint: Because the strap placement is also wider than normal bra straps, these can fall down frequently if they're not tight enough! Hello! I loved this tank top too. It is very, very soft and it hits right were high-waisted pants do, which creates a very sleek, fitted look without needing to tuck in. This aspect was lovely! I dig a tucked-in look, but hate the extra time it takes to make sure everything is smoothed out. Extra points for this convenience! I honestly want this tank in all the colors, but I do agree with Lauren—definitely size up if you're interested in a looser feel and fit. I wanted to like these, but compared to my go-to seamless style—which I find to be flattering under anything—the seams of these really stood out and made me worry that they'd be more noticeable. I tried them on and they were comfortable, but I ended up taking them off shortly after and wearing my trusty everyday pair instead. Although I got these in the size I'd normally buy for myself, they cut in a bit more than usual, and I would recommend sizing up. Kim K. described the collection as “comfy basics,” and it has a minimal aesthetic—even the logos are super subtle. Also, making a bra that actually fits your boobs is no small feat (Kimmy nailed it, in our opinions), so with this and the quality in mind, the prices aren’t bad at all—everything is between $18 and $56.  
  It racked up a 30,000-person waiting list by the time it first dropped, which isn’t surprising considering the success of her initial shapewear launch. (She made a whopping $2 million right after SKIMS debuted, JSYK.) But since not EVERYONE’S into shapewear (according to Cosmo’s own data, 76 percent of you wear it only for special occasions), this new collection is definitely made for more everyday use.  Basically, the ribbed fabric is amazingly soft and the simple silhouettes are functional but still pretty, especially in those gorge pastel tones.

			 This site is life-changing, people! Gather around, because I need to let you in on a little fashion secret that actually has changed my life. There's a website called Fame & Partners featuring all kinds of fresh styles — from casual to ultra formal — and you can customize every single one of them to fit your exact needs. Meaning? You can basically design your own dress, picking one from the site's array of cool silhouettes, and add straps, tweak necklines, create slits, change the hem length, and pick out your own fabric and colors — and it's not even that expensive! (Prices range from $100 to $400.) Also, did I mention that they cater to sizes 0 to 22? Fame & Partners has basically been a godsend for wedding season. I happen to be a bridesmaid in two separate upcoming nuptials, and I'm attending a third with a black-tie optional dress code. Each celebration requires different floor-length gowns. After scanning the Internet and feeling generally blah about the options I found, the selection at Fame & Partners was entirely refreshing — a true departure from the sea of basic strapless chiffon choices out there. The evening wear section has tons of looks in a variety of styles, like jumpsuits, high-low hems, and full-on ball gowns, but I stumbled on three very different ones that'll work for each occasion. The first wedding I'm attending is the one in which I'm just a guest, so I didn't need to buy a specific color. I went for a backless red dress made from heavy georgette featuring a sort of '90s square neckline and two slits on the legs. I liked the retro vibe of this one, as well as the vibrant crimson color, so I just went for it — no customizations. Bam, done.  The next occasion is a summer wedding for one of my best friends from my hometown. Fortunately for me, both the brides in my upcoming weddings are very low-key. They're just asking their attendants to buy dresses in a certain hue, so there's a lot of freedom. For this event, the bride requested a floor-length, pale gray, romantic ensemble. I found the perfect style so quickly. It features ruffles along the sleeves and a frilled slit. I also like that it has a plunging V neckline and a wrap-style waist. This piece originally came in a light pink, but personalizing it was no problem — I switched it out for a pale gray georgette, and it cost me only $16 to make that change. Boom, second look down.   The third piece I needed was for another best friend, whose wedding is taking place in the winter. She has the same parameters as above. The bridesmaids' only direction: Wear evergreen, maxi-length dresses that fit the bride's cool-girl, Brooklyn aesthetic. So I browsed again, finding the right look for her shindig in literal seconds. I ended up going with a plunging, spaghetti-strap gown with a slit. It also has a very sexy lace-up backless thing going on, which is awesome. For this one, I also had to customize the color for an extra $16. Done! I've literally never had an easier time finding exactly what I needed and something totally different from most of the wedding attire that's out there. To simplify things even more, when you input your sizing information, you also write out your height, and the dress you receive is tailored to your dimensions. So, no tripping over a too-long skirt in your extra-high heels. (And no bridesmaid alteration fees!) The only downside is that, because everything is so personalized, you don't get your items as quickly as you would from another online retailer. Most dresses require six weeks to allow time to create the design and have it shipped to you, although it's possible to expedite some orders and receive them in two weeks if you aren't using a custom color. This wasn't an issue for me, since I knew about all these weddings well in advance and wasn't procrastinating on getting the looks set up. So far, I've received all three and have no complaints in terms of fit, quality, or length. (The brides are also all very happy with each style!) Fame & Partners is also environmentally friendly. Because everything is made-to-order, there's less waste, and no adverse effects from mass-production. Also, did I mention they make (very affordable!!!) custom wedding dresses?! Anyway, now you know about this amazing site. Keep them in mind for your next formal event, if you want! Or, for instant gratification, shop the wedding-appropriate styles below.

			 The Klan's all here! The Kardashians have been wearing Fendi all over the place lately, and now a few of them are starring in the brand's latest campaign.  For the Peekaboo bag's 10th anniversary, Fendi had Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, and North West pose in logo-covered clothing for some nostalgic photos around Los Angeles. This is the latest installment in #MeandMyPeekaboo, following a campaign starring accessories and menswear director Silvia Venturini Fendi and her daughters. The double-F logo has recently made a comeback as part of the widespread '90s nostalgia trend. While all have made a timely statement, the Kardashian-Jenners have helped most in reviving the aesthetic: Kim posed seductively on Instagram wearing a matching shirt and leggings, while Kylie took daughter Stormi for a logo-filled stroll.  After these social media moments attracted so much attention, it was only natural for Fendi to have the Kardashian "klan" be the face for their next campaign. In the photos, Kris, Kim, and North mix the brand's older prints with the Peekaboo bag, showing that the looks not only work in a new time, but across generations. Everyone from little girls to the hip grandmas of the world can rock the double-F and the Peekaboo, renewing Fendi's iconic aesthetic in more ways than one. Later this week, Fendi will release a short film starring the three Kardashian women, featuring Kanye West's 2008 hit single, "Love Lockdown." For now, watch the Vogueexclusive preview video below.

			 The answer *isn't* the British taxpayers, if you were wondering.  Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton make tons of public appearances and, on almost every occasion, their outfits cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. They're fashion icons, after all, and the world world wants to see them wearing something new every time.  But, who's picking up the tab? Glad you asked! Here's everything you need to know about where Meghan and Kate get the money to fund their *incredible* wardrobes.  When Meghan and Prince Harry were engaged, she had to pay for all her clothes on her own, or with the help of Harry himself from his personal wealth. Nothing was covered by the royal family funds, unless she borrowed Prince Harry's sweater and that's sort of cheating! So then, this $75,000 Ralph and Russo gown she wore for her engagement pictures? Meghan paid for that herself.  FYI, Meghan Markle's net worth was estimated at $7 million before the wedding, so although $75,000 is a lot, the girl makes her own money. Okay?    Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to release this official portrait photograph to mark their engagement. The photograph was taken by photographer @alexilubomirski earlier this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST It was also reported that she paid for her custom Givenchy wedding gown, which cost over $100,000—with some sources estimating it was as much as $265,000.  Kate Middleton's family reportedly paid for her wedding dress, a custom Sarah Burton Alexander McQueen gown. Now, it's reportedly worth over $400,000. Some people estimate that it cost $200,000 when the family originally purchased it.  Even though Kate Middleton is technically a "commoner," that doesn't mean her family doesn't have money. Kate herself is worth around $10 million, and the company her family owns is reportedly worth $5o million. So she can afford designer threads too. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cornwall, has access to a large estate founded wayyy back in 1337. It's called the Duchy of Cornwall (if you laughed, you're not alone). Basically, the duchy makes money through owning land and renting it to other people, but there's also investments and interest payments in the mix. This family money is what Charles uses to manage all the expensive parts of being a royal.    The fund goes to whoever is the oldest son of the reigning monarch, which is Queen Elizabeth in this case. When Prince Charles ascends the throne, Prince William will become the Duke of Cornwall and therefore inherit this estate. The Prince's annual income from the estate is about $28 million.  He gives Will and Harry money for "non-official" purchases and a royal savings account, according to CNN Money, and they get reimbursed for all their royal activities.  Great question! Last year, Will, Harry and Kate got $4.8 million between them to fund their public lives, which includes salaries, office costs, and other expenses, like clothes. This doesn't mean they spent that much money on shoes, though—but a girl can dream, right? And, specifically, we all know Kate would be dreaming of cork wedges. Apparently, that number went up to $6.5 million this past year to accommodate Meghan joining the fam—and also because Queen Elizabeth has stepped back a little from her royal duties, which means the younger generation has to pick up the slack.  Unforch, they cannot. Even though every designer in the world would be thrilled to send them freebies (even without expecting Instagram promo, because we know the royals aren't allowed social media), there's a hard and fast royal rule stating they can't accept gifts. "[Kate] doesn’t take free clothes, and I’ve heard that from other people who sent her things," Katherine Hooker, whose designs Kate has worn, told Huffington Post in 2013. The family can, however, request clothes from designers and send back whatever they don't use, so it's like Rent the Runway, but with Chanel. They pay for the clothes they end up wearing.  Well, it's not totally clear, but if Meghan and Kate follow in the footsteps of Princess Diana, they might be saving their clothes to auction off for charity later on. Just two months before she died, Diana auctioned off 79 different dresses to benefit cancer and AIDS causes, and raised $3.25 million.  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 Once you see it, you can't un-see it. If you've been keeping up with Meghan Markle's style, you may have noticed this one interesting thing about her footwear. If not, please see exhibits A and B below and take a guess, because it's all the Internet is talking about today. Exhibit A: Meghan's neutral Aquzarra heels on the official announcement of her engagement, on Nov. 27. Exhibit B:  The rust-colored Prada pumps Meghan wore in Northern Ireland, on March 23. If you guessed that she is often spotted in oversized heels, you're a winner! Why does she wear big shoes, you ask? Honestly, no one definitively knows the answer. Maybe she doesn't know her shoe size? Maybe she likes to feel like she has room to breathe. Maybe a palace staffer doesn't know how to convert U.S. sizes to U.K. sizes.  One tabloid speculates that it has to do with an old A-list star hack: "Celebs often go a size up, or even two, in the shoe department when they're at an event or on the red carpet and it's for one reason we can all relate to — to avoid blisters." The source adds, "There's nothing worse than uncomfortable shoes and when celebs like Meghan are wearing heels for a long period of time their feet can often swell up. The swelling can cause blisters, and in the long run, bunions — like long-time heel fan Victoria Beckham has been rumored to suffer with." This person is not Meghan's stylist, so it's hard to say if this fact is true. There could also be other explanations for this phenomenon. When choosing her looks for engagements, Meghan reportedly considers pieces that designers send, and then buys them, so it could also be that she's wearing a designer's best guess at her size, for example. Either way, it sounds like, if Meghan's having blister trouble, she should take a cue from the queen and get someone to break her shoes in before she puts them on. Comfort is key, people.

			 Do they really have more fun? IDK! You probably came here because you are either blonde and want to wear a convincing Halloween costume without the inconvenient/sweaty addition of a wig OR you have a blonde wig that you really like already and you want to find a way to use it. I don’t know your life but I do know you can find some blonde costume inspiration if you scroll on, so, like, what are you waiting for? Are you ready to take some legal action? Suit up in a bend-and-snappable pink bikini top, fuzzy jacket, pants, and heels. Then, hunker down in a chaise lounge all night with a stuffed Chihuahua. Sounds like a fab Halloween, TBH.    Start a trend like Plastics Queen Regina George in a purple sports bra, a tank with well-placed holes, and black shorts. Get in, loser!   Tell me about it, stud. Slip on your tightest black pants, an off-the-shoulder top, and a pair of red-hot heels. Then, make sure your hair is super-curled to pull off this look. Wanna be a superhero for Halloween? Sport a black leather catsuit, cape, and boots and you’ll be a convincing Storm.   Get yourself some cool early-aughts clothing, like cargo pants and a zip-up hoodie. If you want to be a bit more convincing, carry around a faux wooden stake to get those pesky vamps to just back off already. Then slay all night, obviously. Stop. Hammer time. Put on an ancient-looking armor costume and carry a big-ass, fake hammer and you’ll be ready to take the throne of Asgard, or whatever. I’ve never seen this movie. It is a universally acknowledged truth that Beyoncé slayed Coachella. Give it up for the girl who runs the world in a costume that includes a yellow sweatshirt and fringy boots.   If you’re looking for a couples costume for two fair-haired folks, I gotchu. Slip on your most casual hotel slippers and athletic outfits, or your most extra logo’d Canadian tuxedo, and you’ll have all the paps’ cameras flashing. Marriage looks so good on you! An icon and a legend. Live out Lizzie’s pre-Italy trip days in a pink tee, some cropped flares, and some stylish mid-aughts accessories, like the always-fabulous chain belts she’d wear over shirts. The Queen has arrived, and she’s wearing a black-and-gold chain-patterned catsuit with a matching bomber and peep-toe lace-up ankle booties. Follow her lead in a similar look and, as an added bonus, you can rap and sing along to your fave tracks all night long.

			 Just say no to cups and underwire. Raise your hand if you want to feel trapped and sweaty under bra padding when it’s hot out! No one? Thought so. Bralettes are summer’s best friend. The wire-free style comes in all sorts of colors, fabrics, and designs—and it’s 2019, folks, so yes, you can wear it as a top. Take a cue from these street-style stars for 20 fresh outfit ideas, and incorporate these looks into your own summer wardrobe.For more style advice, subscribe here! If you own a sexy slip dress but aren’t sure how to dress it down for daytime, try layering a bralette in a complementary shade underneath. Or if your dress isn’t a solid color, have fun mixing prints. Either way, the addition of a bralette will make it more versatile so you can wear that slinky number out during the day and at night.  Matching sets are so dang effortless because you don’t have to put thought into which tops and bottoms go together. And with the weather heating up, just throw a simple bralette under a striped suit and you’re ready for anything. Show off a cute floral bralette (or any other print) with an oversize blazer and paper-bag-waist pants. Choose sunny hues and lightweight fabrics, like linen, for the ultimate summertime lewk.  Long shorts have been a major trend, so why not stand out in a Bermuda-length pair? With a hot-pink jacket, a colorful bralette, and snakeskin boots, it’s super edgy.   A black bralette looks super classic with a matching pantsuit. Amp up the sexiness by wearing it under a mesh shirt. Vacay shirts are making a comeback this season and they’re perfect for warm-weather activities like drinking wine in the park and outdoor music festivals. Keep it breezy by unbuttoning the shirt to show off your undergarment, and complete the look with a high-waisted miniskirt and casual tote bag.  By layering a vintage-esque studded bralette and full-coverage panties under a transparent mock-neck top and pencil skirt, this sheer ensemble goes from grandma to oh-so-glam.  Boiler suits, like jumpsuits, are a no-brainer if you need to get dressed quickly. Complement it with a sporty neon bralette, whether you want to unbutton it just a little or a lot.  Turn up the heat in a sultry lace bodysuit with an extremely low neckline, and coordinate with a bralette in the same shade. Contrast it with a high-waisted midi skirt that oozes a luxe leather vibe.  Repurpose your sleepwear and intimates, like this pink silk set, for a fab daytime look by matching the bralette and all your accessories to the piping.  A Canadian tux in a light wash screams warm weather and happens to look killer with, you guessed it, a lace-trimmed bralette. Go with a neutral color if statement accessories are your focal point, or swap in a printed version if you decide to keep your accessories to a minimum.  If you already own a two-piece set with a coordinating bralette but want to make it more wearable, simply throw a boxy statement jacket over it.  If you’re still not sure how to wear one on the streets, a quick and easy solution is to throw one on underneath your overalls. Unhook one strap for a ’90s vibe that would make Rachel Green proud.  Another uncomplicated way to style a bralette is to wear it *over* a shirt. A see-through lace piece, like this one, instantly elevates a basic white button-down and jeans. If you don’t want to show tons of skin, a pair of super-high-waisted paper-bag pants is your best friend. Just take this logo bralette and these wide-leg bottoms, for instance. When worn together, they make an undoubtedly chic outfit, especially with a red-orange bag, black pumps, and a choker.   Who would’ve guessed  a bra could look so sophisticated when paired with a sheer dress? This gal is serving a major neutral look, and I am so here for it.  Another morning with nothing to wear? On days like these, consider a monochromatic outfit. All you need to do is pick one item and find separates in matching shades to complete your look. Use a cute bralette as the base hue, then style the rest around it.  Think of this as your new white-tee-and-jeans combo but with a little more skin. A long-line bralette makes an excellent substitute for a crop top, and you can style it with or without a lightweight jacket.   A bandeau-style bralette is remarkably useful when it comes to figuring out how to wear low-cut and revealing garments. You can conceal cleavage and/or a side-boob situation, like this modern go-go girl did here. What is fashion without experimentation? If you already own a bralette that you love, try pairing it with unexpected separates like this fashionista did with a mesh top and open-leg track pants. Take your ’fit from sporty to elegant by finishing it off with kitten heels and a classy circle bag.

			 Mother-daughter GOALS.  Fashion's hottest mother-daughter duo has arrived, and it's Ashley Graham and her super cute mom, Linda. The pair modeled together for Swimsuits for All's Resort 2018 campaign, which was shot on location in Morocco, where they rode camels, looked gorgeous on some sand dunes, and generally served up major mom-daughter goals.   The new swimwear collection dropped on Monday, and the two Graham ladies starred in a video titled "The Power of the Journey" that debuts the line.  “Here I am at 53 years old and in a hot pink string bikini [on set], but I was kind of in love with that swimsuit!” Linda said in an interview with Vogue. She also said it was nice to have Ashley around to make her feel comfortable on the shoot.  Ashley told Vogue that the brand wanted her mom to star in the campaign with her, and she fell in love with the idea. "I was like, ‘That is such a good idea, don’t even ask her — I’m going to tell her! She has no choice!’” Graham said.  Her mom, known on Instagram as @themamagraham, looked amazing in a string bikini, a high-waisted set, and a one-piece alongside her supermodel daughter, and they both killed it in their swimwear, looking confident as hell.  “What I want is for women my mother’s age to feel empowered and to know that they too can look just as hot in a one-piece, a two-piece, or string bikini,” Graham said in her Vogue interview. “I believe that beauty is beyond, age, race, or size, and it’s not a trend— at every stage of your life, you can feel beautiful.”   SHOP NOW Fes Swimsuit, ASHLEY GRAHAM X SWIMSUITS FOR ALL, $108   SHOP NOW Rabat Swimsuit, ASHLEY GRAHAM X SWIMSUITS FOR ALL, $108 SHOP NOW Marrakesh Swimsuit, ASHLEY GRAHAM X SWIMSUITS FOR ALL, $102 Shop the rest of the new Resort collection here, and watch the campaign video above.

			 An investigation. On Thursday, Kim Kardashian made her return to Paris — the first time she's been back since her terrifying robbery in October 2016 — and was spotted arriving at the Louis Vuitton Menswear Spring/Summer 2019 runway show. She wore an electric-blue jacket of the same brand with almost too many pockets to count, begging the question: What is she keeping in there? What does she need all those pouches for???  Let's explore the possibilities: By my count, she's toting a minimum of six visible pockets or pouches, but there could be even more that I'm not seeing. She paired her jacket with black bike shorts that were barely peeking out underneath, as well as black heels and those huge, goggle-looking glasses that she's been sporting recently. (Side note: Are tiny sunglasses dead?) Kanye was there, too, wearing a causal long-sleeve shirt reading "I AM LOVING / AWARENESS," a baseball cap, sweats, and reflective sneakers. But back to Kim's pockets. If you turned baggy cargo pants into a jacket, this probably is what it would look like. But perhaps the bigger question is whether there's even anything inside, like when you buy a new purse and realize it's stuffed with a ridiculous amount of tissue paper to make it look full.     But I'm really hoping it's a Chipotle burrito. Wouldn't that be incredible?  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 And she looks gorgeous as always! On Wednesday, Kate Middleton paid a visit to London's National Portrait Gallery wearing a patterned floral dress by Orla Kiely, which looked completely different from her other outfits as of late. The Duchess is pregnant with her third child, and although her maternity style has been exceptionally chic (remember that Alexander McQueen cape dress?!), usually she has gravitated toward monochromatic solid colors. But while the dress' cheeky flower print felt unexpected, its long sleeves and below-the-knee hemline were still very much her style.  
  The dress featured a high neckline, ruffles, and velvet trim, and she accessorized with suede neutral pumps, dangling earrings, and a clutch. (Her curls were perfectly blown out too, but that's to be expected.) Anyway, here she is with some art!  It was also snowing outside, and these photos are actually magical, because she looks like a spectacularly dressed, glowing angel. I mean. Just. LOOK.

			 Like, will there be smoking in the bathrooms again?! Every May, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute hosts a star-studded soirée known formally as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala, or, for short, The Met Gala or The Met Ball. There's a huge red carpet, where many of your favorite stars, fashion designers, and other public personalities step out wearing seriously show-stopping looks. Read on for everything you possibly could want to know about the event's history, and what's in store for this year's shindig. 
  Publicist Eleanor Lambert started the gala in 1948, but it's only been this buzzy since Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour stepped in and became the chairwoman in 1999. Yes! It's basically a huge launch party celebrating the opening of the Costume Institute's spring exhibition. It always takes place on the first Monday in May. This year, that happens to fall on May 7, 2018. Uh, no — well, not unless you get an invite and also have about $30,000 to spare (the cost of a ticket). This, darlings, is an exclusive event. 
  Since 1995, Wintour has put on the event, give or take one or two years before she became chairwoman in 1999. Designers and celebs, who vary from year to year, also help. This year, Donatella Versace, Amal Clooney, and Rihanna are helping Wintour. Why, yes! The gala has a different one each year. This year it's "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination," according to Vogue. Everyone in attendance will follow that prompt in their dressing — some more literally than others. Per Vogue, 150 designs from Coco Chanel, John Galliano, Christian Dior, and more will be on display. Apparently, 40 of those pieces are on loan from the Vatican and have never been seen outside it. If you want to see the exhibit yourself after May 7, you can find it in three of the museum's spaces — the Anna Wintour Costume Center, the medieval galleries, and The Cloisters. 
  Every year, it's slightly different, as designers often select specific "muses," or A-listers, to bring to the event. Last year, stars like Rihanna, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Gigi and Bella Hadid, Zendaya, Selena Gomez, The Weeknd, Dakota Johnson, Paris Jackson, Brie Larson, and Katy Perry attended. A few of them probably will go again this year. Really, they could wear anything, but it's generally encouraged that everyone keep the theme in mind. The one rule everyone must follow: Celebrities invited to the event by a designer or a brand have to wear that label's clothing to the party. Guests are greeted by the hosts in a large receiving line; then, they take in the exhibit on the way to the cocktail party. After cocktails comes dinner. There's usually also a photo booth type thing that guests partake in. There's also typically some kind of musical performance. Yeah. Last year, a bunch of celebs got caught smoking in the bathroom. This year, the Met will crack down specifically on this activity, and the New York City Department of Health has offered to get involved to enforce it. There's also reportedly a "No Selfies" rule — but nobody really pays attention to that one. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 It's shockingly bright, but that makes it more fun! First came millennial pink, then there was Gen-Z yellow and melodramatic purple, and now there's a new color trend making the rounds: neon green. Or, perhaps for the sake of a catchier name, look-at-me green? Just throwing that title out there, because, IDK, when you enter a room with this highlighter hue literally NO ONE will miss you walking by.  Agree or disagree with the name, it seemed like every celebrity was wearing a variation of the shade toward the end of last year, and now, in 2019, it's still in full force.   really into green these days 💚 Happy New Year! A post shared by  Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Jan 1, 2019 at 11:00am PST In August, Kendall Jenner sported a lime-green one-piece while vacationing with Ben Simmons in Mexico, and she continued to be the shade's number one fan into the New Year.   Then, Kylie Jenner, Jordyn Woods, and baby Stormi delivered SO 👏 MANY 👏 NEON 👏 LOOKS 👏 on their dreamy beach vacay in January.    MY GIRLS💚🍀 A post shared by  Kylie ♥️ (@kyliejenner) on Jan 18, 2019 at 10:30am PST   couldn’t have started the year off more perfect than this ✨ A post shared by  Kylie ♥️ (@kyliejenner) on Jan 18, 2019 at 3:21pm PST   Look at @kyliejenner’s page to see what I see 😍 A post shared by  HEIR JORDYN (@jordynwoods) on Jan 19, 2019 at 4:30pm PST  And, lest you think this was just a Kardashian-Jenner thing, please see Ashley Graham stepping out in this hard-to-miss ensemble this month.  If the Kardashian-Jenner fam—and don't forget Ashley!—aren't enough to convince you of the almost-too-bright-to-look-at shade, there is plenty of evidence of its staying power from the fashion industry itself. It was all over the Spring/Summer 2019 runways of New York Fashion Week, which happened in early September.  Wearing the shade—which can range from a super-bright green to a yellow-green or more of a deep chartreuse—signals a certain kind of confidence, and everything else looks kinda bland next to it, TBH. The vivid hue is just as loud as a bold print without  seeming too busy, and it really takes the phrase "glow up" seriously.  Plus, there's no better way to get through the depressing, dull winter months than by wearing something super eye-catching and bright. While it might seem hard to pull off, it's actually not as intimidating as you'd think. Start slow, and introduce the color with accessories or by wearing one lime-y piece per outfit.  On the other hand, if you're ready to dive right into the trend, consider these items for your next vacation, workout, or winter excursion outdoors for an ensemble that would make your middle school highlighters proud.

			 Because Rihanna's here for all of us. Rihanna’s lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, had fans constantly refreshing their browsers trying to get something — anything! — from the line’s launch last week. And one of the key things that made the line so great was that it was designed to be size inclusive, going up to 3X for underwear and up to 44DD for bras. Rihanna tweeted in a promo video, “Savages come in all shapes and sizes.” savages come in all shapes and sizes!! ya ready? @savagexfenty MAY.11.2018 pic.twitter.com/WsomcmEMzm But some fans, excited to snap up some RiRi-approved lingerie, were sad to see that the bras didn’t come in their sizes, either on the higher or lower end of the spectrum. Buying lingerie is tough enough when you don't fall into so-called "standard" sizes, so many fans with smaller band sizes or larger cup sizes got their hopes up for Savage X Fenty. They made their concerns known on social media:    I was soooooo excited for #SavageXFenty but all the pieces I was excited about don't come in my size. Story of my life. "Size inclusive" is almost always a lie. It always means "here's 25% of what straight sizes get, that's good enough right?" pic.twitter.com/meXnR9b0rA Rihanna, Queen, Robyn....I was rooting for you when you said meant for everyone but not even half my titty fit in a DD. Where the bras for us plus size girls?  #SavageXFenty I’m so confused that #SavagexFenty biggest bra size was only DD.. I thought it was meant to be inclusive ?! Do not try and say you cater for ‘all body types’ by only selling a 32 band size as the smallest option and the most generic, easily available cup sizes 🤦🏻‍♀️ #savagexfenty #allbodytypes Ri, the woman in this video is talking about having really giant boobs, but your sign up form only goes up to DDD cup sizes, which seems incongruous. Is @SavageXFenty going to have pieces that fit cup sizes larger than DDD? pic.twitter.com/ouVcxvlebj Savage X Fenty heard the complaints loud and clear, addressing them on Twitter. It turns out the brand plans to roll out more styles and sizes, although it’s unclear which ones will be added or when they’ll be available.    We understand how you feel. This is only the beginning. We'll keep you updated as more styles and sizes become available. Make sure to opt-in to receive our Savage X Fenty emails. Don't worry Em. We are on the beginning and soon there will be more sizes and styles to come ! Don't forget to opt-in to receive all the updates emails from SavageXFenty ! Apologies for any inconvenience. This is only the beginning. We'll keep you updated as more styles and sizes become available. Make sure to opt-in to receive our Savage X Fenty emails. But given Rihanna’s commitment to inclusivity — just look at her range of Fenty Beauty foundation shades as an example — chances are good that Savage X Fenty will follow through for women outside their current range of bra sizes.   @savagexfenty drops worldwide at MIDNIGHT 12:01 am  EST TONIGHT at SAVAGEX.com !!! A post shared by  badgalriri (@badgalriri) on May 10, 2018 at 10:44am PDT Rihanna also elaborated on that point in an interview with InStyle. "Women come in so many different shapes and sizes, that it's such a beautiful thing,” she said. “You want everyone to feel like something for them. I know what it feels like to be left out of that."

			 I die. Model BFFs Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner (I can't wait for their reality show! I will subscribe, Bravo!) (JK, I already subscribe!) are out and about at Cannes, and they're having an amazing time and it's OK to be jealous, that's a very natural human emotion! First, here they are together at Saturday night's Le Monde Est A Toi party, wearing hella shiny fabric and being cute: And now here's a better look at Kendall's mermaid tail of a lewk: And most importantly, BELLA'S METALLIC GREY BIKING SHORTS: I mean...

			 Because people are doing that. Well, the next Instagram trend is here, and it's the most painful-looking one yet! I guess some people are now getting dermal diamond piercings instead of engagement rings, and the results are... interesting? beautiful? Kinda crazy looking? All of the above? Of course, my first question upon seeing the piercings is: Are these safe?! Apparently yes! “Micro dermal anchors are safe and the body will hold them for years, as long as they’re in ideal places and if implant-grade titanium is used,” professional body piercer Billy DeBerry told People.  “They’re different than other piercings since it’s considered ‘surface work.’ It really lets a person get away from traditional piercings like the ear or nose,” DeBerry added. “With the base being anchored into place under the surface of the skin, the tops are interchangeable with a huge variety of colors, shapes and designs.” DeBerry says he's been doing this for ten years, but they've only recently gotten popular because of social media. Shocker! Cool! Very cool!

			 #17 is SUCH a good throwback.  There's no doubt that television's vast array of characters have made an impact on your wardrobe. Take it from someone who wore countless headbands in high school thanks to a certain Gossip Girl.  Here, 30 of the most iconic outfit moments TV has given us over the decades.  Twin Peaks is a great show binge for fall wardrobe inspo, especially when it comes to Audrey Horne. She wears so many short-sleeve sweater looks and almost always pairs them with a cute long plaid skirt, as seen here.  SHOP A SIMILAR SKIRT When Buffy Summers is not staking vampires in the heart, she's out there rocking rhinestone-studded spaghetti-strap tank tops like no other.  SHOP A SIMILAR TANK TOP Speaking of supernatural '90s shows, you can't forget about Sabrina. She casts spells and gets into hijinks with her black cat Salem and two aunts, Hilda and Zelda, but she also serves up a lot of nostalgic looks along the way, including this leopard camisole, choker, and hair barrette combo.  SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT The '80s sitcom has a lot of great style moments from both Sam and Diane, but her prim and proper outfits (often complete with a white apron) really steal the spotlight.  SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT It wouldn't be Seinfeld without  funnywoman Elaine—and her incredible oversize pantsuits, of course. SHOP A SIMILAR BLAZER Sure, Friends features a lot of iconic outfits over its 10 seasons, but perhaps the most famous is Rachel's wedding dress from the pilot episode. The scene here, in which she's sitting in Central Perk, veil and all, makes it such a memorable moment.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Perhaps no other show encapsulated early '90s fashion as well as Saved By the Bell, especially when it came to all of Kelly Kapowski's looks. From her floral high-waisted jeans to perfectly blown-out, volumized hair, she is definitely a style icon in her own right.  SHOP SIMILAR JEANS Pam Beasley is the queen of cardigans over button-down shirts in The Office. She wears the combo in almost every episode, and it really becomes her signature. Obviously Jim was big a fan! SHOP A SIMILAR CARDIGAN Lindsay Weir is everyone's relatable fave in Freaks and Geeks, and you can often find her sporting her go-to army green jacket.  SHOP A SIMILAR JACKET Aunt Viv was arguably the most stylish person in Bel-Air, thanks to her eye-catching tweed blazers and statement gold earrings.  SHOP SIMILAR EARRINGS Zoey Johnson is truly a fashion expert, and her love for collared shirts and layering—including this white lace pussy-bow blouse underneath a gray sheath dress—is apparent on the show. SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT Serena and Blair (i.e. "S" and Queen B) have the coolest style on Gossip Girl. Out of literally hundreds of outfits, the ones that stand out the most are the iconic matching dresses from the photo shoot in episode four. You know you love them... XOXO.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Cookie's style is definitely OTT in the best possible way—take this head-to-toe leopard-print ensemble she wears in Season 1.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS One of Lorelai's most well-known outfits is the one she wears when all her other clothes were in the laundry. To take Rory to school, she dons this tie-dye shirt, denim cutoffs, and cowboy boots that really cause quite the scene when she rolls up to Chilton's campus.  SHOP SIMILAR SHORTS If Helga were an IRL person, she'd definitely be a fan of millennial pink. Her signature look? A bow and sleeveless dress in the color. SHOP A SIMILAR BOW Issa is known for her eclectic style in the show—the individual pieces might not seem like they go together, but when combined they totally work. Her ensemble in the opening scene, which includes a multicolored jacket, a graphic T-shirt, and denim shorts, is reflective of that.  SHOP A SIMILAR JACKET Reggie's everyday uniform includes a bright magenta shirt, sunglasses, cargo pants, and red sneakers. With her cool-skate-girl vibe she was anything but a "shoobie."   SHOP SIMILAR PANTS Jane's lacy boat-neck wedding dress is iconic due to all the drama leading up to this final, very emotional moment.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Lizzie has eye-catching early-aughts style that includes low-rise jeans, butterfly shirts, and wide belts.   SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT Olivia Pope is a woman who gets sh*t done, so it makes sense that her outfits are all business. Other than saying "It's handled" every five minutes, she also slays a trench coat and stylish black work bag. SHOP A SIMILAR TRENCH Remember Patti from Doug? With her pink polka-dot shirt, blue skirt, ankle socks, and sneakers, her whole look is just as iconic as Doug's green sweater vest.  SHOP A SIMILAR SKIRT Peggy Olson has the best pencil skirts and colorful tops of anyone on Madison Avenue, but perhaps her most iconic outfit is the one when she walks into her new office, pictured here. She carries a box of supplies in hand, accessorizing with a cigarette and sunglasses in the penultimate episode of the series.  SHOP A SIMILAR SKIRT  This trio's solid-colored ensembles are so well-known that even Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin dressed as the characters for Halloween. If they embody any phrase it would totally be #squadgoals, am I right?!  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Tia and Tamera make denim bucket hats look good—and they look even better worn with matching red floral shirts.  SHOP A SIMILAR HAT Mariposa Saloon just wouldn't be the same without Maeve Millay—and her stunning red dress with black ruffles.  SHOP SIMILAR GLOVES Angelica definitely has a penchant for bows and tank dresses worn over long-sleeve orange shirts. And the color scheme of her outfit perfectly coordinates with her favorite doll, Cynthia.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Raven Baxter serves all the fashion inspo, but nothing compares to the green floral dress with a matching neck scarf she models at a fashion show in Season 2. SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Pink and green is Veronica's signature color scheme during the show, like this sweatshirt-and-shirt combination. She also always wears her choker and a silver chain around her neck.  SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT Annalise Keating is known just as much for her impeccable style as she is for her confidence and wit. She frequently pairs blazers with sheath dresses when she walks into a courtroom and completely owns each case.  SHOP A SIMILAR BLAZER Zoey 101 has all the classic elements of a TV show in the aughts—it was set at a boarding school in Malibu, it featured  a group of quirky, but good-hearted friends, it had a love interest we could all get behind (love you, Chase), and gave us a lot of great cami fashion moments, like this pink tie-dye one here.

			 All so tiny. All so nice! If you thought shopping for gifts for guys was hard, try looking for stocking stuffers. Good ideas are just as difficult to come by, except multiply it by two when you consider the fact that the gifts also have to be small enough to fit inside a stocking and relatively cheap (because who wants a nice, expensive present to get lost in a sock full of gag gifts and candy?). So I took it upon myself and did the digging for you (thank me later) to find the best stocking stuffers for men under $50. It wasn’t easy, but now I know what I’m getting every guy on my list, so there’s that. Hopefully, they don’t see this. Anyway, keep reading for the 22 best gifts to put in any man’s stocking. If the guy loves a good cocktail but doesn’t love the time it takes to make them, stick one of these boxes of infused ice cubes in his stocking. Whenever it’s time for a drink, pop one out and pour the booze on top.  If your guy has jumped on the self-care bandwagon, he’d love to find this hydrogel face mask in his stocking. Dads and grandpas would love anything you gave them, but they’d especially be down to get this sentimental party game that rehashes old memories and all the good times. Every tech guy runs into the same issue: not enough plugs for all of his devices. Good thing this practical charging stand with room for an iPhone, iWatch, and airpods exists to solve all his problems. Dads would totally nerd-out over this handy multipurpose tool that could fit perfectly in their wallets. It does a whopping 18 different things, from unscrewing a screw, to opening a beer bottle, and even tightening your eyeglasses.  If the guy is a real whiskey drinker, he knows it can be even better with a drop of water. This silver whiskey pipette is as sophisticated as his tastebuds. If the man in your life spends way too much time staring at his laptop or phone screen (hi, every person alive in 2019), he will thank you endlessly for giving him these blue-light glasses and simultaneously taking away his headaches. If you’re shopping for a gift for a guy you live with, look no further. These fancy citrus-scented post-poo drops will make it feel like you live at a spa—and not like you share a bathroom with an animal. For the minimalist guy who likes to keep things simple, this slim leather card case with seven slots has room for all the basics. I once gave this grooming-product sample box to my husband, and he discovered his now-signature cologne from it. How’s that for gift incentive? Feeling salty but still gotta get your man a gift anyway? Try this set of 12 sea salts infused with a variety of flavors, like garlic, rosemary, and habanero. He’ll get the hint. What happens when you take two of the world’s best foods—hot sauce and black truffle—and mix them together? You get this bomb sauce that anyone would want to put on everything, obviously.  Nothing sucks the fun out of traveling like lost earbuds and tangled cords. This leather roll keeps all his tech accessories organized and is perfect for anyone who travels.  Men’s cologne is expensive. But once your man gets a whiff of this warm, musky fragrance with hints of citrus and ylang-ylang, he won’t believe this one isn’t.  If your S.O. insists on keeping the fridge stocked with beer, get him one of these beer organizers that hangs from the ceiling of your refrigerator so he doesn’t take up all the space. Every sneakerhead needs this shoe protector travel kit. If you can’t afford to get him whatever collector’s shoe he wants this year, this fabric-cleaning and protecting set is the next best thing. Sure, the guy could just pour his liquor over ice, but where’s the fun in that? The ice shooters you can make with this mold will take the burn out of any shot (maybe not, but it’s the thought that counts). Dudes who have beards, love them. Help your dad, brother, grandpa—whoever—keep his in check with nourishing beard oil. This one uses a blend of squalene, avocado oil, and vitamin E to keep the coarse hairs soft and smelling nice. Who cares if this won’t fit in his stocking?! It’ll fit on his coffee table and look bomb, TYVM. If the guy you’re shopping for describes his home aesthetic as “mid-century modern,” he’ll love getting ideas from this book. Whether your guy likes clean-cut hairstyles or just wants a little texture and grit, this versatile pomade will do the trick and the matte finish makes it virtually undetectable.  Give your Games of Thrones fan this doorstopper stocking stuffer to make up for a semi-lacking final season. He’ll really appreciate it once he gets the joke. The gift of boxers is boring—unless, of course, they look like this. Any guy born in the ’90s can appreciate this pair of Space Jam boxer briefs.

			 Step into the hottest season with the coolest shoes.  News flash: Boots aren’t just a wintertime staple. They can look just as fun in the summer when paired with flowy maxi dresses, skirts, and shorts. Here, a bunch of fun booties that’ll make your feet look (and feel!) so cool.  Peep-toe boots with a cutout at the heel won’t suffocate your feet, and the white hue pairs nicely with a summer wardrobe. Racing stripes, but make ’em fashion. These metallic booties give off an athletic vibe, yet they’re super cute when worn with a pleated skirt. From the front, these look like a regular ole pair of suede boots, but from the side? They’re cut out with cool buckle details, so they’re actually breathable. Perforated fabric will do your feet a world of good in the sweltering heat, and these white woven babies get the job done. There’s no better season to wear bright colors than summer. Case in point: these knit booties with a tiered metal heel. Clogs are synonymous with the ’70s, and this pair with its black leather material would look great with any floral maxidress. Bright white patent leather boots are super eye-catching—no matter what the rest of your outfit looks like. Mules are basically a slip-on version of boots, so this black pair is a great option if you don’t want your whole foot to be constrained in warmer months. Cowboy boots aren’t just for wrangling cattle! Wear these with denim shorts and chambray shirt for the ultimate Western lewk, or wear them with a patterned mini to dress it up a bit. Get yourself a pair of non-basic black boots that have a little bit of everything—cutouts, buckles, and laces—for a fashion-forward approach to summertime footwear. Boots that are easy to pull on (i.e., no fussing with laces or zippers) are a lifesaver. This simple white pair differentiates itself from the rest with its scale-like texture on the back. The rugged design of Timberlands is edgy, but the pink hue makes them more unexpected and perfect for summer. This pattern is a great neutral to have in your shoe closet and looks killer with a pair of wide-leg, raw-hem jeans. An unusual but equally stylish take on the boot is a black-and-white pair that wraps around your leg and stays in place with a silver buckle. Give your toes and ankles some much-needed air with this cream-color, block-heel design. Love studs and extra buckles on your footwear? These silver-accented shoes will look great with a pair of high-waisted shorts and a band tee. You’ll get all the compliments when you wear a bold fuchsia pair. Incorporate even more color into your outfit by opting for an equally fun vivid bag. The deep cutout on these will offer relieving airflow to the rest of your foot. Similar to snakeskin, leopard print is also a neutral, and a pair of kitten-heel sock booties will look effortlessly chic with a lacy black slip dress. Depending on where you live (*cough cough* Florida), the summer seasons can get super rainy and humid. Get through the showers in a pair of cute calf-high boots so you can finally splash around in all the puddles.

			 More of this, please!  On Tuesday, Madewell announced the launch of its new sizing, in which denim styles now range from 23 to 37 (up from 35), and dresses, knits, sweaters, tops, and jackets go up to 3X. The company worked with third-party experts to create an ideal fit across all styles, according to a press release. Madewell previously has debuted more inclusive clothing options. In January, the retailer extended its denim range from size 32 to 35, along with its sister brand, J. Crew. It is, however, the first time the clothing company has taken sizing a step further, expanding into categories other than jeans. The 52-piece line is available online now, and you can find its top denim styles in select stores. The brand joins others, like Volcom, ASOS, Forever 21, and Savage X Fenty, that have ventured into inclusive sizing. Shop more from the launch below, and see the full range of items here.

			 Want. All. Of. These. The Academy Awards is a night to celebrate amazing fashion almost as much as it is to celebrate achievements in film. Whether actresses opt for classic silhouettes or straight-up OTT looks, they make use of the occasion to create a memorable red-carpet moment. Click through to see which incredible Oscar dress defined each year.  Janelle Monáe brought her A-game for her Oscars debut with this dramatic couture Elie Saab gown. She definitely made a memorable statement both on the carpet and on the silver screen, having been nominated for her breakthrough performance in Moonlight, which won Best Picture. Alicia Vikander channeled Beauty and the Beast's Belle in this yellow Louis Vuitton gown with her hair worn half-up. The strapless, bubble-hem dress featured metallic embellishments, and she accessorized with silver platform sandals and chandelier earrings. But perhaps her best accessory was the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she won for her role in The Danish Girl.  Emma Stone wore a show-stopping chartreuse-colored beaded gown by Elie Saab that featured a thigh-high slit and matching peep-toe shoes. The actress was nominated that year for Best Supporting Actress for Birdman. Lupita Nyong'o wore a stunning power-blue Prada dress to her first Academy Awards, where she won Best Supporting Actress for her emotional performance in  12 Years a Slave. Nyong'o accessorized with a headband and selected the dress color because "it's a blue that reminds me of Nairobi," she told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet.  This was an unforgettable dress because it helped make Jennifer Lawrence look incredibly graceful even as she tripped walking onstage to accept the Best Actress Award for Silver Linings Playbook. She wore a soft pink Dior Haute Couture gown designed by Raf Simons with tiers of fabric — and accessorized with a LOT of diamonds from Chopard.  Angelina Jolie wore this black Versace dress featuring a thigh-high slit that catapulted her right leg into Internet stardom. She worked the red carpet and presented an award in the same leg-baring pose, which became a truly meme-worthy moment.  Amy Adams opted for a simple, midnight-blue sequined gown by L'Wren Scott, but its simplicity is what made the dress so elegant. The Best Supporting Actress nominee (for her role in The Fighter) completed her knockout look with a vivid emerald necklace and bracelet. Zoe Saldana wore this statement-making couture Givenchy gown with a sparking bodice and purple ombre effect at the hem. Saldana presented the Oscar for Animated Short Film with Carey Mulligan.  Anne Hathaway, who was nominated for Best Actress for Rachel Getting Married, wore this paillette column by Giorgio Armani. She kept her accessories to a minimum, wearing only simple jewelry to keep all eyes on her gorgeous strapless dress.  French actress Marion Cotillard wore a couture mermaid gown by Jean-Paul Gaultier to the Oscars, where she picked up the Best Actress award for her role in La Vie en Rose. She accessorized with long necklaces and a white clutch.   Penélope Cruz, nominated for Best Actress for the movie Volver, dropped jaws in this pale-pink feathered Atelier Versace gown. The bodice was constructed with intricate pleating, while the train added just the right amount of drama to the red carpet.  Reese Witherspoon looked absolutely ethereal on the red carpet in a vintage Christian Dior dress from 1955, which featured an empire waist and a V-neckline. She took home a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of singer June Carter in Walk the Line.  Hilary Swank's navy backless dress by Guy Laroche featured pleated fabric and a back that dipped *down to there*, and the look became a legendary Oscars fashion moment. She won the Best Actress award for her role in Million Dollar Baby.  Charlize Theron shined in this Gucci gown designed by Tom Ford, as she picked up the Best Actress award for her serial-killer role in Monster. She looked stunning in this shimmery look and accessorized with metallic heels, a diamond bracelet, and a silver clutch.  Jennifer Lopez wore this one-shoulder, pastel-green Valentino gown at the prime of the "Bennifer" era in the early aughts, when she attended the Oscars with then-fiancé Ben Affleck. She pulled her hair into a chic chignon so her statement earrings stood out, and she carried a cream envelope clutch.  Halle Berry's sheer, burgundy Elie Saab gown made a splash on the red carpet, in part due to its strategically-placed floral embroidery. In a historic win, she was the first black woman to receive a Best Actress Academy Award, for her performance in Monster's Ball.  Like Reese Witherspoon, Julia Roberts also hit the fashion archives for her iconic Oscar dress, a vintage black-and-white Valentino number. She even told People magazine that she still keeps it in a box under her bed. Roberts wore it when she won Best Actress for her titular role in Erin Brockovich.  Tyra Banks looked like she came straight out of a fairytale with this iridescent, princess-like tulle ballgown by Vera Wang — and a super-tiny top-handle bag. The film Life Size, which debuted in the same year, featured Banks playing the role of a doll who transforms into a human. Gwyneth Paltrow wore this princess-pink Ralph Lauren gown when she picked up the Best Actress award for her performance in Shakespeare in Love. The hard-to-miss color and simple silhouette made this an iconic Oscar gown.  Drew Barrymore wore this sparkly black gown with a plunging back and tiny train on the red carpet, but she really made it a look by placing two daisies in her short, blonde hair. She presented the Oscar for Best Achievement in Makeup.  Nicole Kidman did not shy away from color when she appeared on the red carpet — with her then-husband, Tom Cruise, in tow — wearing this chartreuse Dior gown designed by John Galliano. Kidman attended the event with Cruise, who was nominated for his performance in Jerry Maguire. Winona Ryder channeled old-school Hollywood glamour in this flapper-inspired beaded vintage dress with a shawl and delicate purse. She styled her hair  in retro waves, keeping her jewelry to a minimum with floral earrings and a thin bracelet.   Oprah pulled out all the stops with this brown dress that was a combination of a tulle ballgown and a sensible collared shirt. She paired it with a stunning diamond necklace and walked the red carpet with her longtime partner, Stedman Graham.  Sharon Stone wore this black ensemble with shimmery fabric and a silver brooch. Inside the auditorium, she revealed a gorgeous, sequin halter-neck dress.  Marisa Tomei wore a white sleeveless Chanel dress with black piping, a lace hem, and a bow at the waist on the red carpet. She won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in My Cousin Vinny.  Demi Moore wore this vintage lilac gown with floral applique and matching opera-length gloves on the red carpet. She presented the Oscar for Costume Design.  Whoopi Goldberg won Best Supporting Actress for her role in Ghost, and she attended the awards wearing a black sequin column dress and diamond and pearl jewelry. She brought her daughter, Alex Martin, to the ceremony, and she also wore a long-sleeve LBD.  Kim Basinger wore a satin white asymmetrical gown that she actually designed herself. The actress wore it to present the Oscar for Best Original Score.  Jodie Foster wore this satin blue strapless number with ruching and a dramatic train, which she supposedly spotted in Rome and purchased on the spot. Foster picked up her first Academy Award, winning Best Actress for her role in The Accused.  Cher was known for her showgirl outfits back in the day, so this sheer beaded dress by designer Bob Mackie came as no surprise. She incorporated the tassel details from her dress into her earrings, and she accessorized the body-baring ensemble with a shawl. That night, she beat out Meryl Streep when she won the Best Actress award for her role in Moonstruck.

			 She showed up wearing nothing but flower appliqués. Arriving at Cannes Film Festival today, Paris Hilton was the latest to rock a naked dress on the red carpet at the event this year.  The socialite/mogul/iconic artist who brought us "Stars Are Blind" (aka the greatest Grammy snub of all time) wore a sheer nude gown covered in colorful floral appliqués. The barely-there look marks one of Hilton's most daring red carpet ensembles in recent years.    Hilton topped off her Cannes gown with hoop earrings, a blinged-out silver watch, and her massive diamond engagement ring. The 20-carat pear-cut diamond, which is worth a cool $2 million, is pretty hard to miss.  Her fiancé, Chris Zylka, accompanied her down the red carpet, where he served as the official handler of the train of her gown—as any good fiancé of course does. The couple announced their engagement in January after Zylka proposed atop a ski slope in Aspen.  Hilton is the latest A-lister to opt for a naked dress at Cannes Film Festival this year. Kendall Jenner, Sara Sampaio, Irina Shayk, and more also showed off some major skin on the Cannes red carpet.  And in the wise words of The Simple Life icon herself, "that's hot."

			 They’re also great for lounging while you’re bingeing Euphoria.  Yes, sleep bras are a thing! And they’re just what they sound like—bras for sleeping, lounging, generally hanging around, or for throwing on real quick when the pizza delivery person knocks on your door. While those rumors that they prevent sagging are NOT true, some women might have trouble sleeping comfortably without support. And that’s totally okay! These styles are comfy and wireless, and they’ll keep your boobs in place when you’re tossing and turning. Here, 15 super-lightweight sleep bras you’ll want to wear 24/7.  This top-rated bra is seamless and comes with removable pads depending on your preference. It also has ribbed side panels for added comfort and support, so you can even go out for a coffee run in it. This bra feels like no bra at all because it’s so lightweight. As one reviewer put it: “The silhouette is not ideal for everyday wear, but it’s great for lounging and sleeping.” The style comes in three shades and is amazingly soft. This cozy bra has convertible straps if you like options, and it’s double-lined so it’s not see-through. Also important? The strap adjusters are in the front!! So you don’t have to do some weird arm contortion around your back to shorten or lengthen them. A low-cut bra is perfect for when you’re wearing an oversize, deep-V-neck top and need a little something for underneath. Plus, the soft Pima cotton fabric won’t irritate your skin. This sleep bra feels like a second skin and has a mesh front to make it more breathable—i.e., it’s perfect for counting sheep on these hot summer nights. This bra has all the comfort you’ll ever need with seams that lie flat on your skin. The material is buttery smooth and it even has a cute lil lace detail on the back. This bra is The. Most. Comfortable. The crossover neckline gives just enough support, and the straps are also convertible. This mesh bralette is breathable but still gives you the feeling that you have something there. Also, the trendy Calvin Klein logo differentiates it from all your other styles. This comfy sleep bra has a temperature-control feature that regulates your body heat so you won’t be too hot or too cold wearing it. It’s also closure-free, meaning no hook-and-eye will be digging into your back. A bralette and tank in one, this doubles as a sleep shirt but still keeps everything in place if you toss and turn. This style is effortless and has an adjustable band and straps so the fit is tailored to you. The Supima cotton material won’t chafe or rub against your skin either. Zero itchy tags that rub against you? More bras need this, TBH. Also worth noting is that the spaghetti straps aren’t adjustable, but that means those lil plastic things won’t leave indents in your shoulders. I’ll give that two thumbs up. This bralette has rave reviews for a reason: It comes in all the cute colors, it has a comfy wide elastic band, and the fabric is unbelievably soft. This stretchy sleep bra has wider straps and also comes in a pack of three. Looking for your size? It’s available from a small to a 3XL, so the diverse range is definitely a plus too. A ribbed longline bralette is perfect for hangin’ on your next girls’ night in or if you’re catching some zzz’s. And it doubles as a crop top for going out.

			 And they look fine as hell. Just so you know: Ashley Graham and rising star Paloma Elesser are covering Vogue Arabia's latest issue for July/August, and they truly look like a couple 'a snacks: In the image, both models wear flashy silver sequin styles — Paloma is low-key chilling in a pool in a short sleeved, bateau-neck number, and Ashley is lounging nearby in a form-fitting piece topped with a shaggy gray sweater.  This is apparently Vogue Arabia's "Body Revolution" issue, in which they declare that inside you'll find "The best summer looks to celebrate all shapes."  Along with their twinning image, each woman has her own, close-up cover-shot as well, and they are both SERV-ING, y'all. Inside the mag, we hear from Ashley, who says making people comfortable with themselves has always been her calling: "My mother told me that when I walked into a room, I would greet every single person — even at three years old. It was more of an emotion that I would give people, and it would leave them feeling good about who they are," she said. "I think that's what I'm doing today: letting women know that they are worthy, that they are beautiful, and that they can be happy with who they are in their skin." Paloma talks about self-acceptance. "The feelings that I have about my body today aren't very different from the way I felt about it in first grade," she said. "What has changed is the way I navigate those feelings." This isn't the first Vogue rodeo for either lady. Ashley Graham has appeared on both American (in a group image) and British (solo) publications, while Paloma covered the May 2018 issue of British Vogue with other models who are "changing the face of fashion."

			 Time to get crafty! The last time you thought about tie-dye was probably during some kind of craft activity at summer camp. Just me? Anyway, it’s time to give it another think, because the trend was spotted all over the runways—on shirts, dresses, pants, denim, handbags, shoes, and so much more!—and now it’s hitting all the retailers you love. And guys, it looks way cooler than you probably remember. Just check out these runway looks to see what I mean: 
  Do you still need more convincing? Here’s why tie-dye is awesome. Sure, dressing in all neutrals is fine, but life is way more exciting when you’re wearing colors. Specifically, all the colors at once in spiral form! Yay! Don’t deny your love for everything ’90s. Tie-dye would not be “back” as it is now if we didn’t already have a soft spot for it. So give in! Just do it. Sure there are some tie-dye pieces that are not completely cozy, but most of them are T-shirts, sweatshirts, and sweatpants. Achieving the perfect ratio of both comfy and cute is hard, folks. Tie-dye makes it easy! Anyway, just in case you’re still on the fence...  And if you’re not sure you want to lean all the way into it just yet...why  not start with just some accessories?

			 The Fug Girls on who rocked the red carpet—and who didn’t. Gather round, friends, and celebrate with us this most hallowed of holidays: the 10th anniversary of that time Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift at the VMAs, kicking off a butterfly effect of pop-cultural shenanigans that reverberate to…uh, today, actually. Please join us as we peruse what everyone wore for this special occasion—although, spoiler, only one of those main players was in attendance tonight, and she was an even bigger winner. Kanye, whatever you’re wearing tonight, we hope it was cozy. For whatever reason, Taylor’s been deeply into ’80s-feeling Versace outfits as she promotes Lover. Did she frantically binge The Assassination of Gianni Versace last month? Has she just been kicking around Miami lately? We’ll simply never know. We know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but can someone please write a nighttime drama with a role in it for Lizzo, in which she sweeps into a room wearing exactly this, says something devastating, and then wraps her boa around her neck before exiting to a thrilling music sting (which she’ll also perform herself, on the flute)?  It can even be called Siren. Someone, please, get on this! Do you think Heidi is as perplexed as we are by why she’s been to three out of the past four VMAs? Presumably, it’s so she’ll show up and just...do her Heidi Klum thing, and she must agree with that theory, judging by this typically boob-oozing, thigh-flashing ensemble. We would say it’ll go in the dictionary under “Peak Klum,” but it has too much competition to guarantee its inclusion.  Look, if you were teasing a potential romance with the dude with whom you’ve recently released a sexy duet, and you were both going to show up at a big event like this one, you’d totally wear a white gown too and dare everyone to write wedding commentary. We have taken your clever PR bait, Camila! Point to you!  Straight-up, that canary gown looks stellar on Keke. But our favorite touch is the jewel-encrusted brick cell phone. Is it...a bonus purse? Is it real? Does it work? Can she call her friends and scream that she just saw Missy Elliott? And if so...where can we get one? The folks at Victoria’s Secret are rethinking their iconic fashion show, and it no longer will be televised. No sweat for the Sisters Hadid though, who don’t need gigs as Angels to step out in something lingerie-inspired.  “Wow, 2 Chainz is testing our resolve not to shop” is not a sentence we expected to write today. We’re not entirely sure if that cute swingy coat fits 2 Chainz, but we are wholly convinced it would work on us. Who cares about the boy? Is there any possible way this dress could be ours? No, we’re not talking about her gown. “I’m always kind of classy, kind of naked,” she cheerfully told the MTV interviewer, and truly, that kind of covers all her bases. But we LOVE that she dyed (or just painted?) her part into a Pride rainbow, which certainly is the pot of gold at the end of this look. True confession time: We can never really remember what Diplo actually looks like from event to event. But we’re pretty sure it hasn’t always been High Fashion Cowboy.  When your hit song is called “Hot Girl Summer” and has inspired a million memes on Twitter, you’d better show up at any and all events looking like you’re having one. Mission: accomplished. (Possibly in both the literal and figurative definitions of “hot.”)   These two just announced they’re betrothed, and where better to celebrate than in a place where you can watch Lizzo up close and in person? P. K. has always had an exuberant sense of style, and Lindsey swings for the fashion fences as fiercely as she skied—that often backfires on her, but we’re strangely attracted to her witchy sleeves.  We’re probably going to have a LOT of Sexy Maleficents on Halloween this year; apparently, Alison just really, really wanted to get there first.    In fairness: This whole thing really feels like a combination of Gaga and the MTV Moonman itself, but when she sang on the preshow and busted out some vocal runs in those platforms, with her long blonde hair and dramatic eye makeup, it sure FELT like we were supposed to be witnessing the birth of a new star (but same as the old star). The Amazon is burning and the glaciers are melting, but one constant on which we can always rely: Lenny Kravitz will wear flared denim, a vest, and a torn piece of metallic mesh pretending to be a shirt. His brand is apparently forever. Thank god. Visit the Fug Girls on their website or follow them on Twitter. Their book, The Royal We, is available here.

			 Go on and be your creepiest self.  Halloween is one month away, people!!! Are you panicking trying to figure out your costume like I am right now? Luckily, there’s still time to nail your getup, and if you’re looking to go all out on the spooky vibes this year, kudos to you! Whether you’re channeling your favorite creepy characters (Carrie, the Babadook, or Michael Myers) or you wanna go with a traditional vampire or witch costume, there are plenty of frightening ideas out there for you. So bring on the fake blood, dead eyes, and creepy masks to scare the living sh*t out of your friends—and even complete strangers. Here, 40 scary costumes to inspire (and terrify) you—just scroll with caution.   There might be nothing more terrifying than having a freaking butcher knife in your head. Channel AHS: 1984 with ’80s-inspired hair, bright eyeshadow, and lots of fake blood. Watch the video to see how this makeup artist achieved the spooky look.  Find more scary Halloween makeup tutorials here. Give yourself some literal dark circles, overlined lips, OTT contouring, and you’re ready to break all the laws this Halloween. (Just a joke, don’t actually do that!)  A classic costume made creepy thanks to white contacts, black lipstick, and a dramatic hood. Wear your hair down and use makeup to make your face super pale, like here.   All you need is a red jumpsuit, fingerless gloves, scissors, and a raspy voice to make people jump when you run into them on the street.  Ahh, yes, who could forget sweet Regan? Make yourself look possessed with bright contacts, ghoulish makeup, and fake throw-up dribbling from your mouth. Pleasant.  Glowing eyes with blood coming out of them definitely takes a traditional vampire costume to the extreme. Add a statement choker, black cloak, and bustier to heighten the historical effect.  Sometimes the creepiest costumes are the simplest. Just put these frightening masks over your face, carry fake weapons, and be absolutely quiet to pull off this trio.  All you need is a black hood and spooky-ass face makeup and you’ll look like you can take someone to the afterlife.  Get a blue boiler suit, Michael Myers mask, and fake knife for this costume. I mean, he can be shot, like, 15 times and he still doesn’t die! Pretty scary, IMO.  This is one doll you DON’T want to play with. At all. Seriously. Braid your hair with ribbons at the end, throw on a white lace dress, and make a creepy smile to be instantly recognizable.  Personality? Ice-cold b*tch. DIY an icicle crown, give yourself some blue makeup, and put in white contacts to complete the look.  “Come play with us,” they said, in the creepiest effing voice. Buy an inexpensive blue A-line dress with a collar, pour a bunch of fake blood down the front, and finish it off with socks and black ballet flats with straps. Cute, no?  Really emphasizes putting your BLOOD, sweat, and tears into winning that pageant. Shred your dress and accessorize with fake blood, a fake knife through the head, and tiara for a drop *dead* gorgeous costume.  If you want your costume to have scare factor this year, the demonic sister with glowing eyes from the movie The Nun will definitely do the trick. This is all about the black-and-white makeup, and a cross necklace and a habit will make it complete.  The doll of everyone’s nightmares, TBH. A striped shirt, overalls, red wig, and fake stitches will turn you into the demonic toy.  Skull makeup is a classic Halloween look, but there’s something about this version that just seems downright sinister. Wear all black, then carefully apply black eyeliner over a white base to create cracks and hollowed areas in the “skull.” Sure, the pink makeup is pretty, but the black eyes and fingers? Pretty unsettling.  Like an emoji, but a LOT more disturbing. This one requires careful planning so you can see and breathe, but basically you add a bunch of liquid latex over a base of masking tape to make this papier-mâché-looking mask.  Classic storybook tale + tattered clothes + fake blood = a scary costume that ruins your childhood nostalgia. The more shredded the dress, the better.  Here’s some advice: Don’t ever follow a clown into the sewer. Just DON’T DO IT. Give yourself the same red-and-white makeup as Pennywise and oversize fake teeth to scare the living sh*t out of everyone.  This Ouija-board-inspired makeup is somehow pretty and terrifying at the same time. Write out the alphabet and numbers across your collarbones and chest (or have a friend help), wear black contacts and lipstick, and you’ll look like you can summon some spirits.  Be sure to warn all your friends that you *might* eat their flesh if they get too close. Special-effects elements like torn-out fake skin go a long way toward making you look undead.  Put a white contact in one eye, then add fake blood in a pattern of claws across the same side to make it seem like you got attacked by the big bad wolf. I guess you never made it to grandma’s house?  Don’t be fooled by the cute outfit. Mess up your hair and artfully draw on a huge mouth with scary fangs to confuse (and frighten) everyone on Halloween.  Halloween is coming. Grease your hair back, wear all white, put in bright-blue contacts, and age yourself with carefully placed wrinkles to turn into a White Walker.  You’ve got a little something on your mouth…and eyes. With this spooky getup, the vaguer your features are, the better.  Um, yeah, do you think you can put that back on? Would be much appreciated. Rub on a ton of fake blood and display a fake rubber mask to get a scream outta all your friends.  As if the bloody clothes weren’t enough, there’s also the bandaged, featureless face. Buy a retro nurse’s costume and splatter a bunch of fake blood and dirt on it so it’s extra unsettling.  If you haven’t seen this movie, trust me, it’s just as terrifying as it looks. You'll be the scariest children's book character in town with a black trench coat, a top hat, long fingers, and a black-and-white mask.  Exactly like the Winnie-the-Pooh you remember from your childhood—except with a mutant face and very sharp teeth.  Is this a bad case of non-waterproof mascara or actual creepy black tears? You decide! But really, it’s super easy to recreate with white-and-black face makeup and a white scarf and dress.  Wanna play a game??? Billy is known for his signature swirled cheeks and suits, so channel that creepy lil guy with a matching ensemble.  This is one clown you DON’T want to invite to a birthday party.  Terrifying for whoever answers that doorbell. Super long hair, a dirt-covered nightgown, and creepy voice make this a scary costume.  Anyone have a Tide pen? Become your fave ’80s prom queen with a bloodied white dress, tiara, and curled hair.  Creepy smile? Check. Blood-spattered nurse outfit? Check. Black, soulless eyes? Check.  All the memories of my fave childhood doll are destroyed. A sweet gingham dress looks sinister when you have unsettling makeup on.  Be careful handling pins on Halloween if this is your costume—you never know who might get hurt.  Like a human version of a candle—with extra blood.  She’s probably not as peppy as your average cheerleader. Get a cheerleader costume and shred the skirt, then make yourself pale and dead with white powder and dark circles.

			 If you’re suffering from frostbite, your toes are the first to go. Just sayin’.   Fall is already here and even colder weather is well on its way—dare I say, à la the Starks, “Winter is coming.” But that doesn’t mean you can’t still look stylish—even as the snow keeps piling up well past your ankles. This season, take charge of your cold-weather footwear, and don’t let any blizzards boss you around into wearing bulky, boring, and *gasp* salt-stained boots. Here, 17 of the best winter boots that’ll get you through any snow days but are also cute enough to wear when it all eventually melts away. These styles all offer insulation, waterproof materials, grippy soles—and happen to look way chic. Now shop away before the first snow of the season sneaks up on ya!   This top-rated pair is both edgy and cozy thanks to the fuzzy shearling trim. The lugged sole is also a lifesaver when it comes to slushy conditions.  A bootie that covers your ankles and keeps feet dry is one you’ll cherish forever. These guys have a waterproof membrane and a compression-molded midsole for comfort when you’re spending the whole day walkin’ around—on or off a hiking trail.  Get yourself a boot that works for both rain and snow! A shorter style is easy to pull on with the tab at the back, and if your feet overheat (proof that these really do keep ya warm!), you can take out the shearling sole at the bottom.  Everyone likes having options, and this style is a perfect solution if you can’t decide between a tall or short boot. It also has an almost-perfect five-star rating with more than 100 reviews and comes in four other shades if you need any more convincing.   Blundstones are a cult fave for a reason: The simple silhouette goes with everything, and the front and back tabs makes for an easy on when you’re running out the door. This thermal style has a removable insole and is made from durable leather that can withstand any weather situation.  A style that features rubber at the toes and waterproof leather at the top is a classic and ensures that any snow is kept far away from your feet. The fleece lining at the ankle adds an extra cozy touch.   These all-black hikers are definitely sleek and comfy enough to wear all day while keeping those toes toasty warm, according to the reviews.  This material that actually repels salt and grit like dang magic. If you think annoying stains are actually worse than the snow itself, then you gotta get yourself these zip-up Chelsea boots. Bonus: They’re also super easy to clean.  Want some extra height? A pair of  block-heel hikers looks fashionable, while the rubber sole still keeps your feet grounded in slippery conditions. The shearling trim also adds an extra barrier between your feet and the freezing elements.  If you’re in the mood for a more unique silhouette, try out one with a wooden sole. These have plenty of room for that pair of thick knit socks, and the oiled nubuck leather is soft, not stiff, on your feet.  Sometimes you still wanna look fashionable, even when the snow’s piling up. A pair of studded combat boots with a tight zipper makes sure minimal air gets into your shoes, while the thick sole is sturdy.  Vulcanized rubber means ain’t nothing gettin’ in there, and the burgundy color adds a subtle pop of color to any outfit. Pro tip: These rain favorites turn into winter boots with a pair of warm, fuzzy socks (that also prevent painful rubber blisters—win-win!). You’re bound to beat the snow in a timeless winter boot like this one, which features wool lining and a cuffable suede shaft. These badass boots have a slip-resistant rubber sole with snow-friendly leather. This durable, sporty high-rise boot can be cinched closed to keep heat in. Wet, slippery surfaces will be no match for you in a pair of insulated, climate-proof boots that honestly look like they could be high-top sneakers. A classic fur-trimmed black style that will certainly complement your winter puffer.

			 Karlie Kloss had to be sewn into her dress! The Met Gala is one of the biggest fashion events of the year, which means everyone takes plenty of time prepping for the star-studded affair — as well as documenting their OTT looks once they arrive. This year's Met Gala, with the theme "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination," was no different, and the behind-the-scenes Instagram photos included everything from zapping nose hairs to literally getting sewn into a dress.

			 A lot of sheer fabric, sequins, and plunging necklines ahead.  From bustier disco ball-looking dresses (hi, Jennifer Lawrence) to strategic cut-outs, here's a look at the Oscars sexiest dresses. Violetta wore a super sheer black strapless column on the red carpet. On top of its *very* see-through material, her ruched dress also featured a leg slit.  Watch out, Kim Kardashian. Emma Stone just gave you a run for your money for "sexiest blazer of all time" with this Louis Vuitton suit.  Gonzalez opted for a yellow-as-the-sun gown with a scoop neck and saucy side cutouts.  This custom Vera Wang gown was the definition of sexy with its cutouts, thigh-high leg slit, and mesh inserts.  Sims wore a plunging, long-sleeve gown by René Caovilla with beaded embellishments.  This color-block red and white number seemed like it was held together by a LOT of strategically-placed fashion tape.  Lawrence wore this sequin bustier dress from Dior and was the sexiest disco ball to hit the red carpet.  Gabriel wore the hell out of this teal A-line dress with a very low-cut neckline and shoulder detail.  The Wonder Woman actress' sequin dress by  Givenchy looked like sexy armor, and her gorgeous Tiffany & Co necklace emphasized the low-cut neckline.  Kidman was an actual present walking down the red carpet in this bow-adorned royal blue Armani number.  The neutral hue of this Zuhair Murad gown and its deep neckline made this a sexy fashion moment for  Rodriguez.  Although most celebrities opt for long gowns, St. Vincent went in the opposite direction with this super-short black mini featuring an extremely large sleeve.  Janney won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, but her red Reem Acra dress with a train and dramatic sleeves was also a major winner. A burgundy, off-the-shoulder mermaid dress was Bryant's ensemble of choice, and a diamond choker necklace further accentuated the revealing neckline.  The color of Cornish's cold-shoulder gown blended in almost seamlessly with her skin tone.  Chambers wore a black, one-shouldered column with a saucy side cutout.  If you can believe it, the back of Capshaw's black dress dipped even lower than the front.

			 A picture...of moi?  In no way am I a celebrity—much less one who’s used to awards circuits, a hair and makeup team, or a personal stylist to prepare me for the cameras. So, when Stitch Fix decided to flip the “red carpet” concept to celebrate everyday people and their personal style and invited me to attend, I jumped at the opportunity. It's a company that pairs regular people (re: me!) with personal stylists, who send you a box of clothing and accessories picked out specifically for you based on a super easy style quiz you fill out online. You don't have to sign up for a subscription—you can request a box any time you want—and the selections are completely tailored to your sense of style and daily life. Anyway, obviously I was totally on board with this brand making me feel like a star for a day. The only thing I had done recently that felt remotely glamorous was get a blowout, but posing and being interviewed on a red carpet? This was new territory, and I figured... why not? The morning of, nothing went according to plan. I was running late, threw on the first outfit I could find, schlepped my laptop and makeup bag with me, and was frantically applying mascara on the subway to get there. Not exactly the fabulous prep I'd imagined giving myself before my big debut. It was honestly a day where I could have used a Stitch Fix stylist to pull together a look for me—wearing an amazing outfit is the biggest confidence boost you can get! But when the train pulled up to my stop and I saw the frenzy of photographers on the platform (the red carpet was in a NYC subway station!), I only felt energized and excited. There was a team of people who greeted me, held all my bags, and made my big moment absolutely perfect. I even fell into a groove when posing, which was initially my biggest concern. I mean, “smizing” is a concept I could never quite nail—and knowing where to put my hands? A complete mystery. Side note: Does anyone else have this problem?!  But when it was my turn to walk, I actually felt at ease and confident in front of all the flashing cameras. It was exactly how I imagined it, with strangers shouting “Yes, that’s it!” or “Right here! Look right here!” or “Work it, you look fabulous!” (Apparently, no one got the memo about my botched prep that morning).  There was even a slow-motion camera at the end that made me feel like I could’ve been at a major awards ceremony—except for the fact I was wearing jeans and not a designer gown and millions of dollars worth of jewelry.  Stitch Fix definitely made my morning walk to work completely fabulous, and now the next time I find myself on a red carpet, I’ll FINALLY know how to pose—and where to put my hands. (Maybe.)

			 #Twinning.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. After her fresh, spring green look turned heads Wednesday, Kate Middleton went a totally different route on Thursday for her final public engagement before giving birth to her third child (she's due in April). She channeled her soon-to-be sister-in-law, Meghan Markle. The Duchess of Cambridge visited Chobham Academy in London before heading off to a sports event wearing a neutral coat by Goat, a Hobbs top, and black skinny jeans. Prince William tagged along in his usual blazer and white button-down. Kate's look drew comparisons to Meghan, who frequently wears pants for public engagements. TBH, though, the outfit isn't really that far from something Kate would typically wear herself. The duchess has stepped out in jeans plenty of times before — especially when she's attending more active events. Enjoying Kate's ensemble?

			 Total game changer. Sliding into my coach seat on a recent flight to Boston, I smiled to myself, knowing I was about to be more comfy than literally everyone else around me. After I got all my bags into position at my feet and settled in, I unzipped the back-pocket zipper on my infinity scarf and began blowing up the hidden air bladder. While I was doing this, I noticed I was getting some serious side-eye from onlookers, especially the guy sitting next to me. After an awk couple of seconds of him watching me turn my scarf into a full-on neck pillow, he finally turned to me and asked, “What the hell is that thing?” Nice to meet you too, sir. That thing? It’s the Sleeper Scarf! A bizarre and kind of fashionable accessory I’ll never travel without from now on, TYVM.   Thanks to its inventor, Tiffany Paul (a fellow jet-setter sick of bulky, restrictive neck pillows), it comes in a variety of colors, ranging from earthy tones to bright, cheery hues. Oh, and it only costs $49—a steal, if you ask me.    In my opinion, other neck pillows have too much stuffing, which makes me feel suffocated, but this scarf allows *you* to control the pressure.  Other amazing benefits of the Sleeper Scarf? Not fumbling around with a bulky pillow, figuring out how to attach it to your bag, or wearing it around your neck like a brace as you wander about the terminal. All you do is wear it like a regular scarf and inflate the inside chamber when it suits you. The U-shaped inflatable pillow within is removable too, in case you just want to wear the scarf around town. How to use the pillow to its fullest extent: 1. If you’re awake, enjoying a movie and chowing down on your tiny bag of pretzels, you can go easy on the inflation, giving you juuuuust the right amount of cushion. 2. If you’re taking a nap and you don’t want to wake up with pain, you can inflate it to the max, giving your neck full support while you rest your head to the side to sleep. 3. When you land, all you need to do to deflate the device is push the hot-pink valve in the center—it’ll collapse immediately. Then just zip it back up, rewrap the scarf around your neck, and be on your way, ready for vacay! Please take it from me: You’ll never find a better sleep accessory for flights. And that side-eye from strangers? Jealousy, obviously.

			 I take it from gym to work and even when I travel. I used to believe it was physically impossible to leave my house without a minimum of three bags in hand. I mean, how else was I supposed to trek my workout clothes, meal prep, book-club read, and office heels to and from work? As much as I loved the polished look of carrying a single leather work tote, there was just no way it would all fit.  Then, I was introduced to the Dagne Dover 365 Landon Carryall by a friend who legit could not stop talking about how much she loved the duffle. The colorful neoprene was cute, and my three-bag commute simply wasn’t sustainable. I had nothing to lose, so when the brand opened a pop-up in NYC, I shelled out for their medium-size bag.  Six months later, I can confidently say this thing is magical. Here’s why I’m telling everyone I know they have to buy one:  “Packing lightly” is foreign to me (see above re: the ridiculous amount of stuff I tote to and from work). But you’d never know how much of a hoarder I am when I’m carrying my Landon. The duffle lets me downsize my three work bags to one so I don’t have to look like I’m hauling my entire closet around the city. Another thing the Landon Carryall is great for: weekend trips. Being in a long-distance relationship means I’m a regular on those budget airlines that let you bring only one tiny personal item. Normally, I’d pay the extra fee to bring a bigger carry-on, but the Landon fits everything I need for the weekend (with some extra wiggle room)—and fits right under my seat. No baggage fee required.  The medium Landon is my real true love, but if that doesn’t feel like the right size for you, know you’ve got options. The duffle comes in five sizes, from extra small to extra large, so you can choose whether you want to use it as an atheleisure-y cross-body or as your go-to luggage for a 10-day girls trip to Tulum. And, with 13 colors, you can pick whatever hue matches your ~vibe~. Built-in extras make it literally impossible to be unorganized in the Landon. The medium carryall comes with a 13-inch laptop sleeve, a water-bottle pocket, a removable shoe bag, and a removable air-mesh pouch. Then, there’s my all-time favorite feature: the stretch key leash on the inside. I just attach to my keys to the leash every morning and save what feels like days rummaging through my stuffed bag at the end of the day to get into my apartment.  As anyone who uses the same work bag every single day can expect, my Dagne didn’t exactly stay clean. What’s great is that neoprene is pretty much the easiest fabric in the world to clean. You literally can just wipe it off using cold water and detergent. While Dagne Dover doesn’t recommend machine washing the Carryall (they say it can cause the hardware to chip), I threw mine in a delicate cycle when it was looking extra grimy, let it air-dry, and it basically looked as good as new.  My Landon fits an unreal amount of stuff but doesn’t cost hundreds of dollars like other work bags, and the built-in organization makes it feel easy to get your life together. #SorryNotSorry to all the other bags in my closet that used to be a part of my daily commute.

			 K-Swiss and the iconic movie are teaming up for the cutest kicks ever, BTW. Excuse me, but you should probably know that your fave '90s movie, Clueless, and sneaker brand K-Swiss have teamed up for a delightfully nostalgic new collection of kicks, and yes, there are some yellow-plaid pairs! Let's get into the deets. SHOP SOON K-Swiss X Clueless Collection, Journeys.com, $80 The capsule includes two different colorways that both nod to Cher Horowitz's iconique skirt set. One features the flashy print on the outside, and honestly this would have looked great as a completion to Cher's OG 'fit. The other is more subtle with the pattern on the inner liner of the shoe and a mostly clean, white outer leather look. The best part is that both pairs have the film's original logo on one sole and the words, "Ugh! As if!" on the other one. SO. CUTE.  SHOP SOON K-Swiss X Clueless Collection, Journeys.com, $80 "We are very excited to work on a collection highlighting this movie we all know and love," Geoff Nishimoto, K-Swiss collaborations marketing manager, said. "Clueless is very nostalgic but at the same time is a story that makes perfect sense today. Not to mention the fashion!"  The kicks will retail for $80 and the collection will drop at Foot Locker, Footaction, Finish Line, Journeys stores, and kswiss.com on May 17.

			 These are cute enough to make you forget about how awk it is to go to the bathroom in them. There is simply no outfit that a bodysuit can’t make better. That’s because they’re meant to stay put, fitting to your shape without becoming messy, sloppy, or bunchy. And they do! They make anything you wear look even more streamlined. Whether your outfit is a dressed-up tailored pant, a midi skirt and heels, or  high-waisted denim with your favorite pair of boots, they’ll all look more put together with the expert definition of a bodysuit. The best thing about bodysuits, btw? They’re as simple to style as any other top! Wear ’em with your favorite jeans for a casual vibe, or pair with trousers for something more work appropriate. Get lacy and skimpy for a night out, or get cozy with one that looks like a sweater for the winter. The bodysuit outfit options are truly endless, so stop reading this introduction and just scroll on already for some picture-perfect inspiration.  Hi to this amazingly cute bodysuit, and no one else. You’ll be totally brunch-ready in this, a pair of skinny jeans, and contrasting white accessories. A tortoise-shell printed bodysuit is perfect for pairing with a leather miniskirt, don’t you think? Absolutely l-i-v-i-n-g for this autumnal color scheme, complete with a silky, blousy rust bodysuit, snakeskin pants, and loafers.  Can’t go wrong with a little semi-sheer animal print action. Pair this deep-neutral top with black pants and thick-strap sandals and you’re ready for drinks! Or, add a blazer and you’re ready for work. So versatile! Nothing says boss bitch quite like a black turtleneck bodysuit with sultry lil cutouts at the clavicles. Throw on your trusty leopard midi and heels, and the rest of the boardroom will bow down. Hello, texture! Adore a good velvet and leather pairing, and this off-one-shoulder navy bodysuit + leather cropped pant vibe is absolutely killing it. Everyone, meet my new fave casual Friday look (aka this varsity sweater bodysuit with wide-leg jeans and white pumps). Ripped jeans, white boots, and this great, patterned blouse-esque bodysuit is your fall staple! Night on the town? Go for this sizzling see-through look with a bralette and dark denim. If you want to wear denim but you hate feeling too casual, let this outfit be your guide. Complete the look with a pair of heels and a little bag.  Not only is the color of this mock-neck bodysuit fun enough to stand on its own, but it also has a sneaky open back. The juxtaposition of the soft lavender with a tough leather skirt is a recipe for tons of compliments.  This tan, button-down, long-sleeve shirt and cognac-hued cord skirt make the perfect couple, don’t you think? Pair with over-the-knee or at-knee boots for a fall vibe you’ll love. For those warmer fall days, pair a jewel-tone, ribbed bodysuit with leather shorts and lace-up heels. The tank underneath snaps together with the sheer overlay on top, ensuring the blouse will keep its tucked-in look all day long. The brightness of this style against deeper colors—like a brown corduroy skirt and tan knee-high boots—makes it standout all the more.  The jeans-and-a-tee look, upgraded. Wear a casual crewneck bodysuit with a pair of distressed denim and a low heel and you’re ready for a day of looking cute while running errands. Yes to pairing of neutral snakeskin and olive cargo pants. A pair of sandals makes it summery, but swap those for sneakers for a casual fall vibe, or pumps to make it office appropriate. Winter-white leather pants and a shiny blue bodysuit? Consider this my cold-weather mood board.  Holiday party vibes, right this way. No, this is not a jumpsuit, it’s a bodysuit and a pair of coordinating culottes, which means three outfits for the price of one, thank you very much. You may remember pink bodysuits like this one from your middle school dance class, but this one’s completely different with light-wash denim and a double-breasted blazer. No flesh-colored tights in sight.  Everlane has extended its line of bodysuits meant for daily wear, and for that we’re all grateful. The bright white is a no-brainer for wearing whenever you need a simple yet sophisticated top. Like, paired with these printed pants, for instance.  Free People has a treasure trove of great bodysuits, just FYI. Although many tend toward the under $100 variety, this one is worth the extra splurge. The all-over sheer is contrasted with a corset-style lining that covers you where you’d want it to. It’s the perfect sultry yin to your edgy leather jacket’s yang.

			 Plot twist.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Remember those $315 denim panties that went viral last month? They sent the entire internet into an effing tailspin, and with good reason. Who on this green earth would wear DENIM underwear? The chafing, the wedgies, the flashing potential … there are so many things that could go wrong. And on top of all that, they’re over $300!! Absolute insanity, y’all.  The infamous undies come from the French brand Y/Project, who, if you aren’t aware, are known for making wild denim pieces. They’ve made jeans with Slender Man-length legs, jeans with detachable chaps, and even double-jean jeans. They’ve basically become experts in the world of weird denim, and despite how strange their products look, people actually … buy the stuff. Who? IDK, probably trendy ~fashun~ influencers with money to burn. But what happens when “normal” people try a Y/Project denim creation? Well, Clevver’s Joslyn Davis and Lily Marston decided to find out.  Despite the aforementioned issues with wearing denim underwear, the panties are … actually kind of cute? Though they’re def not something you’d roll up to work in, they’d be cute for a festival or, as Joslyn suggests, with some fishnet tights. “These are worth $315 because this is some high-quality denim,” Joslyn explains. “It sucks you in in all the right places—I feel like this is really made for a woman’s body.” And in case you really want to go all out, Joslyn and Lily also tried on a matching denim bra to go with the panties. Sadly it’s too late to stunt at Coachella with this look, but it would be perfect for one of those “pool” parties where no one actually goes in the pool (which is normally annoying, but in this case, it could be perfect since wet denim is an absolute nightmare). If you’re a brave soul, the possibilities are endless.

			 Literally changed my life. One of the deepest joys in all of life is being comfy. But even in the day and age of bras that are supposedly made for women by women and to our specifications, I find that I'm still most satisfied with my ~support~ in a sports bra. That's why I've been secretly wearing them under almost every outfit I can over the past year. 
  For anyone who is interested in doing this as well, I've found that it is easiest to wear the racer-back style sports bras beneath dark or thicker-knit, crew-neck tops and sweaters. The spaghetti-strap styles have even more versatility with scoop-, square-, and some V-neck dresses and shirts. 
  The perks? Actual support, a full range of motion, and the ability to seamlessly switch into gym clothes for your post-work workout. I'm a pretty lazy person, so anything that allows me to skip any step at all is a win-win for me. That last one is especially awesome if you are highly uncomfortable in public gym locker rooms and would prefer not to do the whole sports-bra-over-your-regular-bra-then-unhook-the-underneath-bra-and-pull-it-out-through-your-cleave move. You know the one. And for any of you "But sports bras aren't sexy!" people...I beg to differ. There are lots of sexy sports bras out there, be they strappy, see-through, lacy, or basically bralettes with thicker lining. 
  Alright, this has been my PSA. Go forth and enjoy the world in newfound comfort, my friends!

			 Warning: These are aggressive! From wearing ball gowns made of see-through construction materials to suiting up as an actual alien, here are the 40 craziest looks in the history of the Grammy Awards. She really took the theme of butterflies and ran with it. Gone With the Wind meets, well, Olivia Newton John. In all fairness, this was actually a pretty standard look for Cyndi Lauper back in the day. A nice day for a white wedding (times two). I like to think ONJ spent the week before the Grammys sitting at home bedazzling that denim jacket herself. Sparkles, ruffles, and hair that's absolutely full of secrets—I give you the '80s! Scrunchies and sparkly fringe = a classic combo. The highly embellished crotch was a bold choice.  Music's queen of fashion channeling Little House on the Prairie, maybe? Why not dress up like Minnie Mouse to an awards show?  Big sleeve energy.  They were really into mint green, obviously. No bottoms, no problem! The. Dress: An extremely low neckline that changed all our lives forever. Someone seems to have gotten lost on their way to the Renaissance fair. Actually, this isn't that crazy by today's standards, but back then it was pretty scandalous. Just wow. A lot going on here. She must really like peacocks. The flapper theme came on a little strong. Maybe this dress was originally a costume from a zombie prom movie?  Judy Jetson would be proud of this lewk. This is actually fabulous. The red carpet needs more OTT maternity outfits.  Between the spikes and the shoes, Gaga should have won an award just for making it down the red carpet without impaling herself.  The tiniest dress ever and the largest headband bow. Oh, Lord. A lot to unpack here. Waiting for her to pull a well-trained rabbit out of her hat. I'll just leave this right here with no comment. Construction-site chic.

			 I'm never turning back. Once I reached a Certain Age, there were three things my Texan mother instructed me never to leave home without: lipstick, some sort of jewelry, and a bra. I have a distinct memory—sometime during my childhood—of my mom sending me outside to ask a neighbor a question, because she couldn't step out just in a T-shirt. Suffice it to say, I grew up in a Bra Household. Some necessary context: I came of age in the early 2000s, when it wasn't yet stylish to flaunt intentional nip slips or embrace the natural shape of your breasts. This was the era of needing to wear a bra so badly that clear straps were a real thing people bought. So when I started growing boobs (or "developing," as all the Texan ladies told me), I stocked up on the vibrantly colored, lace-trimmed, uber-padded monstrosities that were readily available in every mall store I frequented.  I continued buying basically the same kinds of bras until I was 23. The colors got more muted with age, and I ditched the padding I never really needed, but I figured the only option for hoisting up my C- or D-cup boobs (depending on the day) was a torture device-esque contraption with wires.  Then, around 2016 (according to the internet), the winds shifted: It seemed like nobody wore "real" bras anymore. Instead, bralettes became the thing—teeny-tiny, flimsy-looking cloth triangles that appeared daintier than the trainers I bought at Limited Too.  I was furious. This seemed like smaller-boob privilege at its peak. I passed by the tables of colorful, soft-looking bralettes in stores with a sneer on my face. I refused to try them on. They'd never fit me, they weren't for me, and I was irrationally pissed that they even existed. In an effort to love myself and try something new, in July 2016—the summer of the bralette—I went a full week without wearing a bra. The experiment was terrifying until it was the best thing I'd ever done. It helped me ditch a lot of the socialized shame I felt around my boobs. Newly invigorated, I decided, Fuck it, I'm going to try a bralette. The following year was a series of misadventures. I tried delicate lace bralettes that looked pretty until I put them on and spilled out of them. I slipped into soft, cotton options that worked well but weren't at all stylish. I bought flimsy little things that stretched out within an hour and were no more useful than going bra-free. But then I found it. My personal holy grail, my white whale, my pot of gold at the end of boob rainbow: the perfect bralette. I unearthed my treasure at a local lingerie store called Brooklyn Fox, but the brand is Underprotection—a Danish line of undies that looks cute, is created using ethical labor, and is made from recycled materials that are better for the planet than traditionally sourced fabric. (And if you don't live in Brooklyn or Denmark, don't worry! Yoox carries Underprotection, and it's often on sale. The bralette I have sometimes sells out, but this black option is the same exact thing.) As a bralette-testing veteran, I can say that this one is great due to a few key things. It has removable padding (not push-up padding, just some thin material to add an extra layer if you want it there), adjustable straps, and—most importantly—multiple clasps in the back, so you can adjust the fit. Something most people don't realize about bra construction is that the band that goes around your ribcage is where all the support comes from. A loose band equals a poorly fitting undergarment. My biggest gripe with the pull-over, non-clasp bralettes is that I always had to size up to find one that properly fit my boobs, and then the band inevitably would be too loose. By including clasps, the Underprotection option solved that problem for me entirely.  This bra also has the regular conveniences of a bralette. It's extremely soft and is so comfortable I hardly realize I'm wearing it. I can very enthusiastically recommend it to anyone but especially to women who, like me, need something a bit more supportive and adjustable than other pieces provide. Best of all? It doesn't mess with the natural shape of the boobs I've spent (most of) a lifetime learning how to love.  Follow Hannah on Twitter.

			 Just because you're going to get sweaty, doesn't mean you can't look cute.  If you always take your phone with you so you can jam out to your music, leggings with a side pocket will be such a game-changer.   If you like the cool look of mesh inserts with the added practicality of its cooling effects, than these black leggings are totally for you.  Scrunch butt leggings are totally a thing and work wonders if you want to look like you've been hitting the squat machine extra hard without actually doing any squats. Truly a genius invention. If your aesthetic is less sporty, opt for a pair of ombré leggings in a gorgeous aqua color scheme. The lightweight material and moisture-wicking quality is functional, while the pattern screams fashionable athleisure.  Don't like full-length leggings? Get yourself this colorblocked pair with white contrast trim for an athletic look that doesn't feel like your legs are suffocating in spandex.

			 Have you noticed this? Another day, another new thing to realize about Meghan Markle's post-wedding style. Are you ready for the latest revelation? Apparently, since getting hitched on May 19, the Duchess of Sussex has worn this one thing a lot. Can you guess what it is based on these pictures?

Getty Images Meghan attending the prince of Wales' 70th birthday at Buckinham Palace on May 22. Getty Images Meghan at the Young Leaders Awards Ceremony at Buckinham Palace on June 26. Getty Images  If you guessed that she seems majorly into the color pale pink, you'd be correct! She's worn the color on at least three different occasions since tying the knot. That is a lot of times for one color, TBH. It's also quite the change from the colors she was spotted wearing most ahead of the royal wedding: rich greens and navy blues. Want to get in on Meghan's soft pink aesthetic? Shop it below!

			 Savage x Fenty can't come soon enough. In an Instagram post on Tuesday (which is also coincidentally National Lingerie Day), Rihanna announced that she is releasing a lingerie line called Savage x Fenty on May 11.  In the post, she's wearing what looks like a lacy pink bodysuit with underwire cups and some sexy cut-outs, which I'm assuming is part of the collection that will be available exclusively at SavageX.com. And basically, we all know it's gonna be the best thing in the world because IT'S RIHANNA. Our queen has given us a few sneak peeks leading up to the launch: Eeeek!!! And what's even better? It's (probably) going beyond straight sizes! YES, RIHANNA, YES! Mic brings our attention to the fact that Savage x Fenty is most likely gonna be hella size inclusive. Which, duh. This is Rihanna and she knows what she's doing and is the best at what she does, and so NA DOY her lingerie is gonna be fierce AF for EVERY BODY. The underwear looks like it'll be available in sizes XS-3X and bras will go 32A-44DD. While I'm hopeful sizes will go even higher (ladies of all shapes and sizes deserve Rihanna!), this is an amazing start, and one that almost nobody else does.  Once again, bow down to the queen of everything. Thank you, Rih Rih.

			 OMG, dying at #20.  Yes, Halloween is less than a month away, folks! If you don’t already know what you’re gonna be for the ~spooky~ day, now’s the time to double down on brainstorming an epic group costume idea with your friends. From pop-culture moments and iconic movie and TV characters to your favorite band, there’s no shortage of inspiration so you and your BFFs can turn everyone’s heads at this year’s Halloween party. Keep scrolling for 78 hilarious, fun, and OTT group costumes, and start dropping your faves in the group chat ASAP.  Channel ALL the emotions with this fun group costume. You can use a combination of things you already own as well as store-bought items like face paint and wigs to really go in on those ~feels~.  Choose your fave character and put on some gowns, crowns, hats, and overalls to make it seem like you just walked straight out of a Nintendo game.   Grab a croquet mallet, your best pleated skirt-and-blazer combo, and red lipstick to dress up as the characters from this ’80s classic.  If you and your friends are Disney obsessed, this is the group costume for you. (Although you might have to fight it out to be the princess you want.) Hit up a Halloween store for an exact outfit or make one yourself if you’re up to the task.  If you’re a ’90s baby, there’s no better way to give a shout-out to your fave decade—just grab some acid-wash jeans, a fanny pack, and a scrunchie. Put your best detective skills to work with this group costume. (And make sure you bring Scooby Snacks to refuel.)  As the saying goes, “The more the merrier!” Really, all you need is a red dress and blue ribbons (or a wig) for this fun costume.  A group costume that’s as sweet as honey. (Sorry.) Everyone can pick their fave storybook character and make a matching set of ears to go with it.  Put on your best cat ears and all your leopard-printed things to be this iconic trio.  It’s super easy to recreate the outfits from this classic flick using clothes from your own closet (e.g., a denim jacket, flannel shirt, jeans, a pink top).*Raises one fist in the air*  The whole gang is here! Even Regina’s “cool” mom. Deck yourselves out with pink shirts, plaid skirts, and cropped cardigans to get the lewk.  You’ll be dancing and singing “Summer Nights” the whole time with these costumes—i.e., pink bomber jackets, black leggings, and neck scarves.  “In the name of the moon, I will right wrong and triumph over evil…and that means you!” DIY these with some fabric paint and makeup skills to create the tiaras…or just order them online lol.  Don’t you wanna…don’t you wanna Fanta Fanta? Kylie Jenner and her friends wore these latex pieces, but anything in a solid color gets the point across (especially if you have your coordinating Fanta bottle with you).  The best news? Everyone can pick their fave color! Also, if you don’t have matching boots and gloves, plain white ones work just as well. Ummm, not gonna throw in any spoilers, but only one of these characters is still alive. Create a halter top by wrapping and pinning some fabric, wear a matching skirt, braid your hair, and you’re a queen! Or if you’re a dragon, uh, buy a dragon mask?  Perfect if you live for dramatic eye makeup. Wear something black, mesh, and leather, then go all out with the eyeliner and face paint.  Ugh, as IF! The feather boa, plaid outfits, and flip phones definitely make this group costume recognizable.  Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band never looked so good. You might have to hit up a thrift or vintage store for these colorful ensembles, but it’ll be so worth it when you look like THIS.  If you don’t have friends willing to commit to the group costume, your dogs always work too! A flame shirt, spiked hair, and sunglasses are SO Guy Fieri.  Say it three times, and the striped icon will appear!  The girl on the far right is such a mood. Cardboard + paint + twine = your colorful board. Then just cut out your name tag for this fun game-show costume.  The claw!!! Glue some big ol’ googly eyes on a green headband, add alien ears, and give yourself matching makeup.  Instead of going as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, put a different spin on your Harry Potter costumes and go as horcruxes instead. Quick, grab the sword of Gryffindor!  What’s better than one Britney? Four, of course. Channel the pop star through time with each person dressing up in a different iconic look.  True relationship goals, am I right? Puff some white powder on your face for a spooky vibe, wear black head to toe, and put on some bright red lipstick for this costume. If you’re going as Gomez, draw on a thin pencil mustache and wear a suit.  Welp, this is pretty terrifying. You can wear normal clothes, because, for this costume, it’s all about the effing scary masks.  Who run the world? These superwomen, duh. You can pick up  these ensembles at just about any costume store or online.  Sure, these nurses are just from a movie, but it doesn’t make them any less horrifying. All you need is a white dress, fake blood, a nurse’s hat, and either great makeup skills or, like, toilet paper for your face. Joy!  Who needs legs when you and your crew all have fab sequined tails? Break out the bedazzler on an inexpensive bra, give yourself mermaid-worthy hair, and go all out with body glitter to look like you just walked straight out of the ocean.  Belcher fam represent. Glasses? Check. Pink bunny ears? Check. Big burger? Check.  For all the hard-core dominoes fans out there, cut out white circles, stick them to your black outfit, and lie down on the ground. Yay for minimal effort!  More like #Baewatch, right? Lifeguard gear might be hard to find during fall months (unless you live in Florida), so order some whistles, red one-pieces, and shorts for a coordinating costume.  Channel all that ’90s nostalgia with your best buds, who also no doubt had a collection of these in their bedrooms.  Speaking of nostalgia, how about this major #TBT to one of Cartoon Network’s best shows?  Everyone loves a classic pun costume. Go heavy on the eye makeup, and then sport some stripes and berets.  The best kind of party TBH. Cardboard is your friend for these triangle-shaped costumes.  The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now…except here’s a bunch of old Taylor Swifts from every phase of her music career.  Every posse needs a ringleader with a top hat.  If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends. Live out your Spice Girl dreams and rock some go-go boots, sequins, tracksuits, and leopard print.  It’s now a competitive sport. DJ Mustard spinning some sick beats.  Floaty crown-y things or wires? But all jokes aside, you just need wigs, wands, and huge teeth to nail this costume.  And I say, “Hey! What a wonderful kind of day.” Button-down shirts under sweaters complete with animal ears make this a relatively easy (and meme-worthy) costume.  Is it hot in here or is it just the actual fire? Match the color of your ’fit to your element for this one.  On Halloween, no one can judge you for wearing a wedding dress not on your wedding day. What do you get when you cross solid-colored blankets with huge-ass eyeballs? These “Yip yip yip yip!” guys.   A plaid gray T-shirt and red poster board will come in handy for this. And if someone doesn’t get it, just say, “Recalculating…” Tie-dye shirts and LaCroix make this one cute and refreshing group costume. Get khaki shirts, cargo pants, and boots for the human part; buy this blow-up thing for the dinosaur part.  Look at those cute, curly tails!  Suddenly craving a smoothie rn. An oversize T-shirt, coordinating wig, and Sharpie does the trick for this one.  Never pass up a chance to dress like Harley Quinn. I mean, the two-toned pigtails AND pants? Incredible.  This costume’s all about the epic hair. Prepare to hear “Move it, football head!” all night.  No fighting over who gets to be Wednesday Addams! Plié and jeté your way through all the Halloween parties with these contrasting black and white tutus.  Crop tops will forever be immortalized by shows about babies who can’t fit their clothes. Why be terrifying when you can be cute and fluffy? Get a sleep onesie and stick one of the symbols on it, and congrats…you’re a bear!  The only kind of trolls worth acknowledging. Colored hair spray, lots of gel, and bright tutus are the key for this throwback costume.  Feel free to block, mute, or delete anyone who tries you. Don’t let this sugar, spice, and everything nice fool you! Go monochrome, get some white socks with back shoes, and you’re ready to kick some ass.  Now THIS is how you use a pool noodle.   Dress up like your favorite time of year with your besties. Dibs on fall!  Never heard of Rosemary Leaves…she must be new. Piling on top of each other to create a rainbow is optional and not necessarily recommended. With this costume comes a non-optional family portrait. Especially to see Deb’s crimped hair in all its glory.  Major throwback in the building. I’m thinking it was Miss Scarlett with a rope in the kitchen… Outwitting bullies one recess/Halloween party at a time.  Bring on the ’80s vibes with this amazing Stranger Things tribute.  Just don’t expect any damsels in distress. Instant. Halloween. Hit. A good old-fashioned #TBT to the Stone Age. Cut out felt patches to recreate the patterns on these outfits.  The kid’s show that’s way funnier for adults. There are tons of Adventure Time–themed clothes online, like this Jake shirt, that will complete this group getup.  Hard on the outside, sweet on the inside. Just know you’ll be dueling all night. Never pass up a chance to wear all black. Ever. Wear what’s already in your closet, and then just shop for a chic witchy hat.  Now that’s a squeaky clean costume! Buy tulle at a fabric store, bunch it up, and now you’re a loofah.

			 It’s time to start shopping, y’all!  ‘Tis the season to freak out over what kind of gift to give absolutely everyone you know, amirite? Really though, the stress is real. Your in-laws might might have a different taste than your co-worker, so you obviously can't give them the same thing. Unless you're like my mom, and you just give everyone a box of chocolates every holiday—you do you! But if you're trying to be more thoughtful and specific with your gift-giving this year, we've rounded up 40 presents for absolutely anyone from cheese boards to AirPods to dog carriers. (Yes, even your pup deserves somethin' special!) So scroll on for some gift ideas that would make anyone happy this season.  They’ll love a smart coffee mug that keeps their brew warm 24/7. These classic Nike Killshots are made for casual everyday wear, and they're just undeniably cool.  A tassle keychain will help them juice up their phone battery on the go. A neoprene toiletry bag is a great travel accessory for a relaxing weekend getaway. Gift them a travel wallet that is both chic and practical with several compartments; plus, it zips up flat for easy storage.  Consider a set of three colorful bags that are ideal for grocery shopping, lunch-packing, and pretty much anything else. A silver ear climber will look SO good on their lobes—especially if they have multiple piercings.  A rose-flavored potted balm is the best way to keep their lips hydrated during brisk winter weather. A sound aficionado will adore this sleek record player with Bluetooth capabilities.  A lil trio of candles is perfect if they constantly have one lit in their place at all times.  Any wine lover would appreciate a device that will keep a bottle of still or sparkling wine at a drinkable chill for hours. They love wearing a whole bunch of rings, so why not add one more to their collection? I bet they don't have a delicate band in a fun wave pattern yet!  A set that includes a long-lasting eyeliner with a precise flat brush will give them a dramatic eye look. Top it off with the included mascara and creamy shadow sticks so their makeup pops even more.  A coffee-table book all about iconic photographer Bill Cunningham featuring all his gorgeous street style pics is the perfect present for someone who's v into fashion.  They'll adore a sleek pair of AirPods they can easily tote with them without any wires getting tangled.  They can rearrange these vases all over their space or keep them together in a fun arrangement to brighten up a coffee table or dresser.   Give them a toasty faux-fur burgundy coat that’s not just cozy—it’s way chic! Friendship bracelets have never looked so stylish thanks to these colorful beaded babies with pops of gold accents.  This navy knit is great for layering as the weather gets colder. And who isn’t always in need of another sweater? Give a gift of Prosecco that they can share with all their friends (or keep all to themselves). This set of six mini bottles comes in a cute gold-speckled see-through bag that you can use as a purse, too.  An aerator will make their wine taste even better, and this one is also small and portable to bring to any party, too.  Are they always sporting a new nail polish color? Give them a set of classic reds that they'll definitely want to wear for the upcoming holiday season.  A portable speaker that’s small yet mighty will help them keep the party going no matter where they are. A stainless steel set featuring a frying pan, saucepan, and large pot will make whipping up delicious meals a breeze; plus, they'll just look so nice in their kitchen!  If your giftee is all about biking, consider a minimal helmet with a anti-theft pop lock so you can leave it safe with your ride. This one comes in a bunch of other colors, too!  If they always cheer on their team every time they play, a beanie in their colors is a go-to present that'll also keep them warm.   Self-care is way cooler with a crystal-based facial massager, which can reduce puffiness, improve skin tone, and reduce under-eye circles. Give the gift of the coziest throw to that friend who hates a night out but loves a weekend of binge-watching Netflix. A silky eye mask will help them get the best possible night’s rest. A packable hammock will be a welcome addition to a camping-enthusiast's gear. They can use it to nap, cuddle, or star-gaze. Their spreads will look 1,000 times better on a pretty blue agate-themed cheese plate. A six-piece set that targets wrinkles, dark spots, and an overall dull complexion will transform their skin.  A neck pillow with a built-in hood is the travel essential they never knew they needed. A super soft sleep shirt will make their lazy Sundays as cozy as possible. A snake plant will add a bit of green to their apartment. This guy also comes with a minimal ceramic pot that'll look good in any space.  Socks are a present that gets more and more exciting the older you get. So basically someone's gonna be psyched when they get this plush cozy pair with contrasting lines.  A Polaroid is 100% better than their phone camera. So many cute memories to document!  A moisturizing mask with hijiki algae, rose of Jericho, and hyaluronic acid will give them a dewy, hydrated look. A ceramic diffuser will make their home smell fabulous for guests during the holidays and well after. The perfect pooch deserves an all-weather travel case that’s just as cute as they are.

			 Don't even try to come for Blake's fashion sense. You'll fail, for sure. 😂 Blake Lively has been parading in beautiful suits around New York City in recent weeks, while on a press tour for her new movie (also starring Anna Kendrick and Henry Golding) A Simple Favor. And, yes, she's pulled off EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Because she's Blake Lively, and she's a golden gleaming goddess who can do no wrong in the style stakes IMO.  But, it seems like one person on social media dared to voice their hot take, Fashion Police-style. This is the Internet, after all, and there's always a snarky contrarian. Instagram commenter @gabeluna took to the comments section on Blake's post showcasing a tastefully multi-chromed plaid suit, saying "I say this with so much love & respect for you babe, please hire a stylist or fire the one you're currently with." The sass! The audacity!   Blake 👏🏻 #CommentsByCelebs A post shared by  Comments By Celebs (@commentsbycelebs) on Aug 24, 2018 at 10:37am PDT And while Blake could have simply ignored her hater (who is def wrong about that gorgeous, structured masterpiece that follows the color scheme to her colorful new  film), she decided to give a cheeky reply. "Thank you for the tips, sir. Alas, I've tried to fire @blakelively so many times. But that b*tch just keeps coming back. She won't leave me alone."  Blake 👏🏻 #CommentsByCelebs A post shared by  Comments By Celebs (@commentsbycelebs) on Aug 24, 2018 at 10:37am PDT Blake truly does not have a stylist, as she revealed in an interview with WWD earlier this year. "The hard part is going through all the fashion shows and screenshotting all the looks you like and calling them in," she explained. "I have an assistant who helps in calling in the looks. But a lot of it is I have relationships with the designers."  The hilarious, light-hearted,  but also self-deprecating comeback was caught by Instagram account @commentsbycelebs. Blake and her husband Ryan Reynolds have had a reputation of trolling each other online with sarcastic comments and the most ridiculous tweets, but this is definitely one of her best works yet. In other words, being a clapback queen definitely... suits her. Follow Jasmine on Instagram.

			 Practical and comfy! Meghan Markle did a totally new thing on Friday, when she visited Northern Ireland with Prince Harry. She seemingly took a page out of Kate Middleton's fashion book and recycled a piece she's already worn! 😱😱😱 Eagle-eyed fans spotted the fact that the Victoria Beckham sweater she wore at her most recent event looked suspiciously similar to the one she had on in her very cute engagement photos with Harry.   Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to release this official portrait photograph to mark their engagement. The photograph was taken by photographer @alexilubomirski earlier this week at Frogmore House, Windsor. A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Dec 21, 2017 at 3:59am PST Honestly, it's kind of hard to tell something like that from this engagement picture, since you just see, like, one shoulder of the sweater. But if she did pull a K-Mid and recycle it, it's fun! Why? Because most celebrities step out wearing different pieces every day — so much so that we all start to think, "Do they just wear stuff once and throw it out?" Kate — and now Meghan, if this is true — is more relatable when she wears an item again. Plus, it's nice to see how she styles an item multiple ways. Anyway, apart from the VB sweater, Meghan wore a jacket from Mackage, a (now sold-out) skirt from Greta Constantine, a Charlotte Elizabeth handbag (available for pre-order here), and a pair of rust-colored velvet pumps by Prada. The whole ensemble looked very good!

			 R.I.P. VPL. No matter how incredible your outfit looks, it can be ruined as soon as you turn around and see those dreaded VPLs (that's "visible panty lines" to you, friend). Yes, you can definitely go commando to avoid them, but not everyone feels comfortable sans ~skivvies~. Here, eight ways to achieve a seamless look without giving up your underwear.   When it comes to tight clothing, jersey, silk, and other lightweight, slinky materials are not your friends—they're too smooth and clingy. Save them for looser silhouettes, and opt instead for thicker, more textured fabrics, which are better at masking subtle lumps. When in doubt, opt for an item with a bold pattern—the busier the print, the better it will be at hiding your lines. 
  It might not be ideal for the summertime, but when the weather starts to get cooler, a pair of tights or pantyhose should smooth out any lines you might have otherwise. Plus, they won't feel bulky underneath your clothes.  It's retro but it works. Pro tip: run both the skirt and the slip through a wire hanger a few times before you put them on to prevent any annoying static electricity. There's a reason professional stylists use thongs and G-strings exclusively. They might not be as comfy as your high-waisted, cheeky, or full-coverage pairs, but they *will* eliminate pesky lines.  
  If you need to go even further than thongs, these underwear stickers exist—some styles are even washable and reusable. Since these don't have any waistband, they come in handy if you're wearing a super tight-fitting dress that also happens to have major side slits (à la Bella Hadid, here).    Boyshorts are great because they go right under the curve of the butt cheek instead of cutting across it. A little lace hem is also good for making the line less abrupt and, thus, less noticeable. 
 Shapewear is great for creating a smooth line under your clothes but don't torture yourself with anything too tight. It's seriously not worth it.

They can store coffee beans, nuts, and spices—and look pretty at the same time.  An easy way to make a bathroom feel more elevated? Buy a sleek mirror. This one even senses when your face gets close to it and lights up automatically.  Whether they're aspiring chefs or cooking novices, a pan that's a hybrid between a deep sauce pan and a skillet will get a LOT of use in their kitchen.  A lit candle can make even the most barren space feel more homey, especially when it smells like a fresh bouquet of lilies.

Add delicate strings to the bottoms that go above your hips and it's both retro and sexy.  Support has never looked so luxe, thanks to the green velvet fabric on both the underwire top and bottom of this 'kini.  Subtle ruching in the center of a bikini top prevents the dreaded uniboob situation, and it adds a sweet detail to a more daring leopard print style.   A scooped neckline with wider straps offers more coverage for those with larger chests (if that's what you're looking for!). This cute striped two-piece also comes with the option for custom embroidery on the top.  What's better than a vivid blue design with a romantic bow? One that's fully reversible with black lining on the other side. Talk about the best of both worlds.  A two-toned suit with a racerback will definitely turn heads on the beach volleyball court or out in the waves. The wide waistband won't slip if you're moving around, and the fabric is not only quick-drying, but it also doesn't lose its shape.   A longline bustier top with boning provides structure if you're not a fan of flimsy, thin triangle tops. Plus, the green and pink palm print on this is perfect for your next beach trip.

We’ve worked tirelessly to design bras that don’t just scale up in size, but that have additional supportive elements that are nearly unperceivable to the naked eye," she explained. The extended sizes are currently available for the: To find your perfect size in ThirdLove’s new offering, check out the ThirdLove’s Fit Finder.

			 An investigation into the history of the "dad shoe" trend and what actual dads think about it.  In April, Kendall Jenner hit a Revolve party during Coachella, posing for pictures wearing a teeny-tiny crop top, high-waisted cargo pants, and a fanny pack slung across her shoulders. At first glance, the scene was nothing out of the ordinary — until you looked at the supermodel's shoes: a pair of black sneakers with a bright yellow sole and blue accents, not so dissimilar from my dad's running shoes.    Although some may have considered her footwear choice unusual, it was hardly surprising. It was just the latest example of well-heeled celebrities adopting the thick-soled, clunky, undeniably comfortable shoe trend. Dubbed "dad shoes" by the Internet, it's been adopted by other famous fans including Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian, Hailey Baldwin, Kaia Gerber and Jordyn Woods, who took her dad sneakers quite literally with an April Instagram post.  🌪 A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Mar 1, 2018 at 9:02pm PST  I've fallen in love with you Hangzhou💚 A post shared by  Bella (@bellahadid) on Apr 2, 2018 at 9:51am PDT  get your “dad” shoe game up. A post shared by  HEIR JORDYN (@jordynwoods) on Apr 19, 2018 at 8:17pm PDT But how did this happen? Why did this clunky shoe suffer so much ridicule when worn on the feet of dads everywhere, but now, seemingly all of the sudden, they're cool? Elizabeth Semmelhack, a shoe historian and the senior curator of Toronto's Bata Shoe Museum, has some answers. Semmelhack says the trend grew out of "normcore," which she describes as avoiding  "hyper branded, super luxury, in-your-face-fashion" and, instead, toning down your look with a more muted and nondescript outfit.    Although running shoes and sneakers have been around for centuries, dating back to the early 1800s, this particular thick-soled style is enjoying a newfound fashionable status — thanks, in part, to luxury brands that have gotten into the dad shoe game.  Take, for instance, Balenciaga's always-sold-out Triple S shoes, which debuted at the brand's menswear show in January 2017. Or Louis Vuitton's Archlight sneakers, which appeared at the brand's Spring 2018 runway show in October later that year, and have been spotted on the soles of many a street-style blogger. The shoe style also made a cameo on Gucci's Fall 2018 runway in February.    Semmelhack cites the Adidas Stan Smith being welcomed into the fashion fold — it was re-released in 2014 — as another catalyst of the trend. "Honest to God, what could be more of a dad shoe than the Stan Smith? I mean, my dad wore them," she says. "Even though it was revived in fashion and is basically no longer considered a dad shoe, when it came back in a few years ago that was one of the few things that gave it its edginess."  
  However, Semmelhack says nobody's wearing them simply because they're comfortable. "The majority of people are wearing them in a kind of ironic way," she says. "They’re super themselves, super fashionable and beautiful, and then to have on these somewhat clunky shoes creates an edgy compare and contrast." She also acknowledges how celebrities lend legitimacy to the trend. "We live in a very visually driven celebrity-driven culture at the moment, so I definitely think that it’s part of the driving force for the popularity of the dad shoe."   Semmelhack adds that sneaker culture itself traditionally has been masculine, so women can make powerful statements by wearing them. "Women’s footwear is in a bit of an interesting moment, because the high heel is losing currency, and I do think, in part, it's related to the #MeToo movement," she says. "It's a kind of complicated moment in actual politics, gender politics, and the politics of footwear." But how do IRL dads feel about their clunky footwear becoming popular now? In a very thorough and well-conducted survey (i.e., canvassing my coworkers' dads), I asked them to share their opinions on their trendy shoes, using a trendy pic of Kendall Jenner for context: Cosmopolitan.com's entertainment editor Eliza Thompson texted her father, 60-year-old Ron Thompson, for his thoughts.  "Shoe looks OK," Ron wrote. "I never wore anything like that to the office — it looks like a running shoe, which of course I wear when running, which I do typically three days per week." But while he insisted no one has ridiculed his sneakers, Eliza disagreed. "I have definitely made fun of his shoes," she said.  
  "I didn’t know these shoes are popular now," wrote Steve Lardiere, father of Cosmopolitan.com's Snapchat editor Mia Lardiere. "I guess I am a trendsetter and didn’t know it! Or maybe the '60s style is back. "No matter the reason, I’m just happy the fashion world finally caught up to me." My own 55-year-old dad, Shailesh, said: "I've never really heard of the term 'dad shoes,' or the fact that they were made fun of, and I just think that cool shoes are what cool dads wear when they they're seen out and about and they just own it." He then sent me a photo of his own so-called "cool" shoes, which have stripes and little yellow cars on them.  Whether someone's rejecting what's perceived as traditionally "feminine" (like high heels), making an ironic statement, or simply wearing these bulky styles for comfort, the trend isn't going away anytime soon. The next time you do an Instagram deep-dive on your favorite models, bloggers, and influencers, keep an eye an their feet, because they'll most likely be wearing some version of this It Shoe.  If you can't get enough of these oversize but weirdly fashionable sneakers, shop more styles below — and who knows? Maybe the next time you see your dad, the two of you will match.

			 Turns out, toothpaste isn’t just for your teeth?! There is waaay more that goes into getting red-carpet ready than you might think, and celebrity stylists know better than anyone because they’re behind the scenes. Surprising style tips and tricks that solve a range of solutions include using hairspray as static guard or sandpapering the bottom of shoes to prevent falls—and that’s just scratching the surface. Here, 18 red-carpet fashion hacks from the experts themselves that are absolutely genius.  Yes, you read that right. Celeb stylist Erica Cloud spoke to Glamour about the trend: “It’s a great thing to put on the ball of your foot or even your heel or the tops of your toes, [as a] kind of numbing agent. I usually do it about five minutes before we put the shoes on—not too early, so that it has the most lasting effect.” Laura Harrier used the trick at the Critics’ Choice Awards.  At the 2019 Oscars, Melissa McCarthy also told E! that she slathered it all over her toes before walking the red carpet. And honestly, this trick isn’t just for fancy events—kinda tempted to try it for all my uncomfy heels.  This body oil not only helps with dryness, but it also relieves achy feet. It also comes in a lotion, if you don’t like using oils. This tip isn’t just for the red carpet, although you wouldn’t want a bunch of photographers capturing these white streaks. Stylist and creative director Avigail Collins dished to Who What Wear about the wonders a deodorant-removing sponge can do to eliminate those super-annoying marks (also, LMK why I only notice these halfway through the day?!). Take one of these sponges and give the mark about five to six quick strokes to see it completely vanish. No time to Amazon-order a sponge? Don’t worry. Stylist Jenny Rodriguez told Good Morning America that she uses nylon socks to remove deodorant stains from dresses—and it actually works really well?! Just rub this back and forth over the mark and it’s like magic. Kim K. sent the internet into a spiral with her viral gaffer tape Instagram pic, but celeb stylist Janet Mandell, who’s dressed Gigi Hadid, swears by this tape trick too. She spoke about it to Good Morning America, saying it pulls the breasts up, “keeps the cleavage natural, and keeps your breasts up and tight all night long.” Gaffer tape has a very gentle adhesive, so it is easy and not painful to remove. If you’re so inclined, here’s a roll to test it out yourself. Sometimes, when you hit a seam, the zipper stops suddenly. And no matter how much you tug at it, there’s no hope it’ll ever go up. So first things first: Don’t yank on it. Period. Second thing? Get some bar soap. Stylist Tara Swennen tells Glamour: “It kind of lubricates it and then you can pull the zipper up.” She says the wax of a crayon or a banana peel can help unstick a zipper too. Seriously genius.  The same applies for when you want to remove your fancy gown. Jane Fonda could’ve used this advice because she had to sleep in this dress when she couldn’t get the darn thing off. “Here’s me the next morning. I couldn’t get my dress unzipped so I slept in it...never wanted a husband in my life until now,” she captioned this hilarious Instagram photo. No jammed zippers here! Also, as a bonus, your hands will smell so amazing with these scents. Sure, something might look great in normal lighting, but as soon as bright flashes go off, your outfit can turn a bit see-through depending on the fabric and fit. Violetta Komyshan’s black strapless dress did just that in front of the cameras, but she responded to it in the best way, captioning an Instagram Story with one word: “oops.” Lindsay Lohan also experienced this when her ruched black mini turned sheer in the blinding camera flashes at the 3rd Annual “Rock the Kasbah” fundraising gala in 2009.  Watching celebs fall on the red carpet is fun for literally everyone...except the actual celebs. Jasmine Caccamo, who’s styled John Cena, has found a solution to avoid those embarrassing slipups: sandpaper.  “I usually sandpaper the bottom of my clients’ shoes because the red carpet can get a little bit slippery with the type of carpet they use. It guarantees that they won’t slip and fall and have a big wardrobe malfunction,” she tells ABC News. Lip balm’s great for your lips (duh), but—surprise, surprise!—the product works surprisingly well on hair too. Gregg Giannillo, who’s worked with ABC News correspondent Lara Spencer, says he uses it to smooth any rogue hairs.  He revealed how he discovered the super-convenient hack to GMA: “I showed up to the red carpet and some of my things got confiscated and my client was about to go on air. I had a lip balm in my pocket and I used my lip balm to tame her flyaways because that’s all I had.” Noted. The pose can really make or break each look and how it translates on the red carpet. “Some dresses look better in certain poses than others,” says stylist Katie Keim. “Going over what poses look best with each dress is critical to the entire feel of the red-carpet look.” The poses should point to features of the outfit (like Zendaya’s over- the-shoulder look emphasizing her backless dress) or go with the mood you’re trying to channel with the ensemble, much like Lady Gaga’s dramatic movements at the Met Gala.  This trick does two things. First, it keeps your makeup intact. Second? It also prevents it from rubbing on your outfit while getting into it. This is especially important when you’re wearing something white with bright eye makeup, like Margot Robbie is here.  Also, the more constricting and tricky the neckline is, like Bella Hadid’s here, the more likely your makeup will rub onto it. Once your head is through the opening, you simply remove the scarf—and crisis averted! Just make sure you’re using a scarf that you don’t mind getting dirty.  Never deal with makeup stains again, folks! All about them ~pearly whites~, and no, not talking about your teeth (but keep those clean too, pls). Zanna Roberts Rassi dished all her style secrets on the Rachael Ray Show, where she revealed how adding a “little dollop [of toothpaste] on a kitchen towel” and then rubbing it on the leather gives shoes a good clean.  Working the toothpaste into the stain is a super-cheap sub for getting shoes cleaned professionally. Plus, it adds more shine to the material, making them look brand-new. “Half the time, you can see the lines, you see that edge cut, it catches the fabric,” stylist Kate Young told The Cut. “I’m also [dressing] the people who are photographed under very intense lights, so even though you might not see it in the reflection of the mirror when you’re getting ready in a nicely lit bathroom, you will see it in a photo.” Her point is evidenced here by Hayden Panettiere’s Golden Globes after-party dress in 2011.  Stylist Katie Keim agrees. “Sometimes nothing at all is better than trying to hide.  I would rather see a nipple than a nipple cover, so if you are using nipple covers, make sure it looks seamless. Otherwise, go without [them].” I mean, can you even imagine Rihanna wearing them with her iconic CFDA outfit in 2014?  Keim says matching your underwear to your skin tone is also super important. “Look for laser-cut [styles] so there are no seams,” she says. It doesn’t matter whether they’re from the dollar store or a higher-end brand like Commando, getting as close a match as possible can make an outfit look more polished—especially when it is as sheer as Kristen Stewart’s here.  While Kendall went with beige underwear here, it still doesn’t blend in as well as it could under her see-through metallic gown.   This seamless high-waisted style comes in six other shades ranging from light to a dark brown.

			 Serious bridal inspiration, right this way. Engaged and planning your dream wedding? Single AF but into #WeddingPorn? Married yet still in the market for celebrity bridal eye candy? You've come to the right place, my friends. Here are 50 of the most breathtakingly beautiful wedding gowns worn by your favorite celebs, from Meghan Markle to Audrey Hepburn. Get ready to pin.  The Orange is the New Black star wed Lauren Morelli (who is a writer for the show!) wearing an elegant off-the-shoulder number. Lauren opted for an embellished jumpsuit by Christian Siriano that featured an epic cape. The duo tied the knot in 2017 in Palm Springs, California.  Of course the Duchess of Sussex is on this list. The off-the-shoulder Givenchy gown she wore to wed Prince Harry in 2018 is the very definition of iconic.  Oh, and following the ceremony, Meghan casually changed into this elegant Stella McCartney gown for the private reception. Harry also changed, but this gallery isn't about him, okay?!  The Peter Pilotto dress Princess Eugenie wore for her fall wedding to Jack Brooksbank was beyond gorgeous. Apparently, the bride specifically asked for the gown to be designed in a way that would  show off the scar she has from her childhood scoliosis operation, which  is "a point of pride" for the Princess.  Ciara asked Roberto Cavalli designer Peter Dundas to make her gown for her nuptials to football player Russell Wilson. Apparently, it took four fittings in three countries to get the dress just right!  Not only did heiress Nicky Hilton get married to heir James Rothschild at Kensington freaking Palace, but her Valentino gown alone reportedly cost $75,000.  For Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder's California wedding, Nikki decided to ditch the veil. According to her dress designer Claire Pettibone, the actress didn't let Ian see the dress until the big day, even though he called and texted her at every fitting.   Lauren Conrad is another celeb who got married in California (which is to be expected as the former star of Laguna Beach and The Hills), and  she wore a custom-made Badgley Mischka gown for her wedding to William Tell.  First, yes, this is a picture of Solange biking to her wedding ceremony in New Orleans (who needs the limo?). Second, this Stéphane Rolland cape dress is only one of the four outfits she wore on the Sunday of her wedding.   Olivia didn't wear a dress to her wedding ceremony—she wore three pieces by Carolina Herrera: a light cashmere sweater, a tulle skirt, and white shorts.  For Kaley's San Diego wedding to Karl Cook, she wore this incredibly ornate Reem Acra dress, which, according to reports, took 400 hours and a team of 10 seamstresses to construct. Wow!  Kim and Kanye obviously had an over-the-top wedding, with a pre-party at Versailles and the ceremony in Florence. For her dress, Kim wore a custom gown by then-Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci. A couple of days after the actress married James Heerdegen in New York, she shared this picture of her Givenchy gown, tweeting, "I'm sorry I have to share what @riccardotisci made for me!! #iloveyouricky!" In 2013, Kelly wore this dreamy Temperly wedding gown to marry Brandon Blackstock. Now let's all please take a moment to appreciate the sunflowers in her bouquet, 'cause that's adorable.   Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's treasure of a relationship became official in the eyes of the law when she wore this Vera Wang dress at her 2013 nuptials.  The singer wed her now-wife, actress, writer, and producer Linda Wallem in a beautiful outdoor ceremony in California. Melissa wore a suit while Linda went with a textured V-neck gown that resembled flower petals. Now where can I find this exact setting for MY wedding?! For her 2013 nuptials, Kate wore an Oscar De La Renta gown that featured, according to Vogue, "an 8-foot-long, 16-foot-wide train." Love a bride who brings the drama.  Keira Knightly delighted the masses (or at the very least, me) when she wore this tulle, knee-length Chanel dress for her marriage to James Righton. The casual bride also clearly loved the dress—she's worn it at least three times since.  Michelle's 2013 marriage to Clay Pells featured the bride in a custom Vera Wang gown. The Olympian and the designer go way back, with Michelle saying, "I wore so many skating dresses designed by her, whole skating shows and everything. I have a long relationship with her." No wonder they got such a gorgeous result!  Anne Hathaway wore this dreamy, gauzy Valentino gown for her wedding to Adam Shulman. That headpiece has me drooling, you? Remember when Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries were married for 72 days? Well, this is the dress she wore to kick it off.  And do you remember when Khloé Kardashian was married to Lamar Odom and they launched a fragrance called Unbreakable Bond? She wore this Vera Wang dress to their wedding in 2009.  Supermodel Kate Moss obvi went high fashion for her 2011 wedding to musician Jamie Hince, wearing a cream dress by John Galliano. Kate Middleton wore this unique lacy Alexander McQueen dress for her marriage to Prince William in 2011, and honestly, I've been thinking about it ever since.  Hilary has since divorced hockey player Mike Comrie (and is now engaged to a new man), but for her 2010 wedding to hubby #1, she wore this stunning Vera Wang number.  Alicia Keys married Swiss Beatz in 2010. The singer-songwriter wore a gorge headpiece, sandals, and a dress by Vera Wang.  Salma Hayek opted for a Balenciaga wedding gown for her wedding to French billionaire François-Henri Pinault.  Chelsea Clinton went with go-to wedding dress designer Vera Wang for her 2010 ceremony. Her A-line dress featured a crystal-encrusted belt, making the gown a sparkly stunner. Katie married Tom in a multimillion-dollar wedding ceremony at a 15th century Italian castle while wearing Valentino. As ya do.  Queen Letizia of Spain went full-royal for her wedding dress, having designer Manual Pertegaz embroider literal GOLD into the collar, cuffs, and hem of her dress as well as the veil, and finishing off the look with a diamond tiara. Casual.

Well, forget those fears.  Scroll on to see how Kendall and five other celebs pull off this look with aplomb. Make it Monochrome Commit to something, and wear the same wash from head to toe like Kendall. The key to doing it right? Making sure your whole ensemble comes from the same brand. Pairing everything with a kitten heel à la Kenny makes the whole getup a bit more dressy and interesting. Suit Up Clueless about the art of matching? Go with a set, like Hailey Baldwin in her Adidas Originals piece. The best thing about coordinating separates is that you can get three outfits for the price of one: Wear them together for a striking, street-chic all-jean look, or match the jacket with a different dress, or the skirt with a sweater. Either way, this getup is fab with sneakers if you want to make it more low-key, or booties if you’re trying to be fancy. Go with the Flow When stepping out in double denim, make sure all your pieces have a similar vibe, like the relaxed feel of Heidi Klum’s distressed chambray button-down and straight-leg jeans with a frayed hem. To make your look more eye-catching, accessories are key. TBH, Heidi’s outfit could have been simple, and yes, a bit boring if she hadn’t paired it with the peekaboo of a sexy lace bra and quirky, yet classic brogues. Go to the Dark Side For the most part, raw, deep denim matches and can be just as dressy as wearing all black. Who knows where Victoria Beckham is heading in Paris here, but she looks damn sophisticated and put-together in her belted jacket and wide-leg jeans. To remain polished, keep your accessories understated and timeless. Just Add Black If multiple shades of blue seems daunting, try wearing one black denim piece to switch it up. Chrissy Teigen’s two-tone look is timeless, yet unexpected. An added bonus: Because her jacket is oversized, this outfit feels fresher, and more on-trend than pairing her pants with its standard, more cropped and tailored counterpart. Break it Up If your jean pieces don’t exactly match, don’t sweat it—just throw on a solid or patterned tee to attract some of the attention, like Mila Kunis in her striped blue shirt. This look is majorly casual, though, so be sure to keep it carefree with low-top sneakers.

			 Shante, you stay. On Friday night, Sarah Jessica Parker attended the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Giorella Exhibition at the New York Public Library wearing a BEADED, FLORAL, FRINGE CAPE and SOME SORT OF MAGICAL HEADPIECE. Oh, and underneath? A custom GOLD GLITTER GOWN. My lord. She is a QUEEN and looks like a QUEEN and acts like a QUEEN and I'll never stop using ALL CAPS to talk about her #iconic style. Truly, what a gift. She is a gift! I know she stole literally everything in André Leon Talley's closet and also Jasmine's magic carpet to make this look, and I am so, so thankful. Sometimes life gets you down and then SJP turns it out and all there's left to do is weep.  Play us out, Carrie! ICONIC.

			 There’s a reason they hold their purses in their left hands. Being part of the royal family is an amazing privilege, but it comes with a lot of traditions and rules—some of which even affect the clothes they wear and how they style them. Here are 36 fashion protocols that Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, and more royals have to follow. Handbags are a common accessory during royal outings where a lot of meeting and greeting takes place. According to royal expert Myka Meier of Beaumont Etiquette, you can always spot Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton holding their purses in their left hands, simply so that their right hand is free to wave, shake hands, and greet the public.  Here’s a look at Kate using the trick with a small clutch. Apparently, the queen prefers skirts and dresses to trousers, which might be the reason Her Majesty is hardly ever photographed in pants and Kate and Meghan mostly wear dresses and skirts to royal events. Meghan is quite fond of pantsuits—like the black Givenchy blazer and trouser set she wore while visiting Ireland in July. Even though Meghan has worn pants numerous times, rumor has it that Prince Harry nixed her plans to pack a formal Stella McCartney suit for their royal tour of Australia. Princess Diana was also known for wearing tuxedo suits to events, so while Her Majesty doesn’t prefer the style, it doesn’t seem to be completely prohibited.  This seems very duh, but skirts and dresses should be kept around knee-length for royal women. According to Harper’s Bazaar, they should never be “more than three or four inches above her knee.” According to Diana Mather from The English Manner etiquette consultancy, jeans are only allowed at the most casual of events and appearances. “If the duchess is outside walking the dogs, for example, then jeans are fine.” If you’re royal—or marrying into the royal fam—then the queen will give her approval of your wedding dress, as is tradition. Apparently, Queen Elizabeth had to approve of Kate Middleton’s Alexander McQueen gown in 2011, and she did the same with Meghan Markle’s dress for her wedding to Prince Harry. Pretty intense, no? Every time Queen Elizabeth or Kate Middleton steps out in public, their nail color is always neutral. They either wear subtle pinks or clear polish when on official business, because only natural-looking nails are allowed at royal events. To illustrate this point, please see the duchess’s natural nails while she’s taking a swig of beer.  The queen has been wearing Essie’s “Ballet Slippers” shade (or no polish at all) for 28 years.  Essie Nail Polish in Ballet Slippers, $8 SHOP NOW Tiaras are worn only to the fanciest of royal events, and typically, they’re worn for the first time by brides. Kate Middleton borrowed Queen Elizabeth’s Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding to Prince William in 2011, and she has even worn Princess Diana’s tiara on several occasions. Wearing a tiara is a privilege reserved for married women only. “It signals the crowning of love and the loss of innocence to marriage,” Geoffrey Munn, author of Tiaras - A History of Splendour, said in an interview with Forbes. “The family tiara was worn by the bride, and from that moment onwards, it was the groom’s jewelry she was expected to wear. It was a subliminal message that she had moved from her own family to another.” You may notice that the queen is never without a handbag, and that’s because she uses it to send signals to her staff. For example, when she wants to leave dinner, simply setting her bag on top of the table lets her aides know the party is ending shortly and she’s ready to depart. Also, when she’s in conversation and switches her purse to her other hand, it means she would like to politely wrap it up. “It would be very worrying if you were talking to the queen and saw the handbag move from one hand to the other,” royal historian Hugo Vickers told People. Princess Diana’s handbag designer Anya Hindmarch famously called her clutches “cleavage bags” because she used them so often to hide her chest. “We used to laugh when we designed what she called her ‘cleavage bags,’ little satin clutches which she would cover her cleavage with when she stepped out of cars,” Hindmarch said in an interview with The Telegraph. And in photos, every time Princess Diana got out of a car, her clutch was right there to shield her chest from prying photographers. So clever! Kate Middleton often holds her bags in front of her with both hands when shaking hands might be awkward, Meier told Good Housekeeping. This is why Meghan Markle’s bags, which usually have a shoulder strap or top handle, seem out of the ordinary when it comes to protocol.   However, according to Meier, the type of bag worn depends on the occasion. “As we see Meghan attending more formal events, we are likely to see her accessorizing with more clutches,” she says. You’d be hard-pressed to find a photo of Queen Elizabeth not wearing bold colors—and for good reason. In the documentary The Queen at 90, Sophie, Countess of Wessex (the queen’s daughter-in-law) said, “She needs to stand out for people to be able to say, ‘I saw the queen.’” If Queen Elizabeth is wearing one of her brightly hued monochromatic outfits, the public can easily catch a glimpse of her in a large crowd. According to the queen’s biographer, Robert Hardman, she was quoted as saying, “I can never wear beige because nobody will know who I am.” For basically every formal occasion, the queen wears a hat that perfectly matches her bright outfit. Apparently, this comes from a very old tradition that women should keep their hair covered. “Up until the 1950s, ladies were very seldom seen without a hat as it was not considered ‘the thing’ for ladies to show their hair in public,” Mather told BBC.  On the rare occasions when the queen isn’t sporting a hat, you might see her wearing a crown or a head scarf instead. The queen apparently insists that hats be worn to formal engagements, such as weddings and christenings, which could explain the royal family’s fondness for fascinators and outlandish headwear.  One of the more morbid rules is that a spare black outfit is always needed in case a member of the family dies. This way, when they arrive back in the UK, they are dressed appropriately to fit the somber occasion.   The then–Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya when her father passed away in 1952. She didn’t bring a black change of clothes with her and consequently had to wait inside the plane for one to be delivered before stepping out. She’s pictured here at her father’s funeral.  Besides the fact that George looks adorable in them, the reason he’s always photographed in shorts is actually because dressing boys in shorts is a long-standing tradition among British royalty and aristocracy. “Trousers are for older boys and men, whereas shorts on young boys is one of those silent class markers that we have in England,” said British etiquette expert William Hanson in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar UK. He said they start wearing pants around 8 years old. You may have seen this photo of Kate playing volleyball in these cork wedges all over the internet in 2013, but the queen apparently isn’t a fan of the style. “She really doesn’t like [wedges], and it’s well-known among the women in the family,” a royal source told Vanity Fair. Kate and Meghan have worn the style multiple times but only without the presence of the queen. Queen Elizabeth makes many royal appearances, all of which usually require heels or dressy shoes. Since she’s constantly on her feet, having someone to break in her shoes means she skips all the uncomfortable rubbing and blisters that come with wearing new shoes. In an interview with Evening Standard, designer Stewart Parvin said, “The shoes have to be immediately comfortable….She does get someone to wear them. The queen can never say, ‘I’m uncomfortable, I can’t walk any more.’” Apparently, a staff member will wear a pair of beige cotton ankle socks while breaking in the queen’s shoes and can only walk on carpet during this period. Dream job, right?

			 She didn't walk a single show at New York Fashion Week.  After skipping New York fashion week, Kendall Jenner just walked her first show of the season in London. She returned to the runway for the Burberry show today.  To catch you up really quick, Kendall managed to piss off the modeling community last month with comments she made in an interview with LOVE magazine.  “Since the beginning we’ve been super selective about what shows I would do. I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the f*ck those girls do. More power to ’em,” she told the magazine.  "But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back,” she said, and added that she “was on the verge of a mental breakdown."   “Since the beginning we’ve been super selective about what shows I would do. I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do. More power to ‘em. But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back,” says the 22-year-old, admitting that she “was on the verge of a mental breakdown.” #LOVE20
 Photographer @alasdairmclellan  Fashion Editor @kegrand  Make up @ctilburymakeup  Hair @jamesspecis  Casting @bitton  Interview #MurrayHealy A post shared by  LOVE MAGAZINE (@thelovemagazine) on Aug 17, 2018 at 1:06am PDT Other models took major offense to this, flocking to social media to point out that Kendall had the luxury of booking less shows because of the privileged family she comes from and the fact that she didn't need the money.  "'Whatever the f*ck those girls do' is their very best to make their way up AND try to make some money so that they can provide for themselves and their families," model Daria Strokous wrote in her Instagram stories. "Oh, and it's 70 shows a season by the way and we are all f*cking proud of every single one of the girls that did it." Kendall responded to the controversy personally, hopping on Twitter to write that her words were taken out of context.   I was misrepresented in a recent interview over the wknd & it’s important to clarify the meaning. It was intended to be entirely complimentary but unfortunately, my words were twisted & taken out of context.I want to be clear. The respect that I have for my peers is immeasurable! I get to experience first hand their tireless commitment, their work ethic, the endless days, the lack of sleep, separation from family and friends, stress of traveling, the toll on physical and mental health, yet they still make it all look effortless and beautiful. The Burberry show is her first since everything went down, and from the looks of it, she's not phased.  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 Men, bedazzled. There are two types of men's figure skating costumes: the boring kind (black pants, button-down shirt, and not a single sparkle) and the Johnny Weir kind (floaty, flamboyant, and caked in glitter). And to be fair, even among the "Johnny Weir kind" there's a clear step — or jump, a quadruple even — up before it's a costume worthy of Weir himself.

			 Focaccia is EVERYTHING.  Kourtney Kardashian has been on an Italian vacation with boyfriend Younes Bendjima and her three children for what feels like MONTHS because she has been sharing endless amounts of travel inspo and bikini pics on Instagram. But her latest post, in which she's eating bread on a yacht, might just be the best one yet. Observe:    In the photo, Kourt wears a neutral bikini — which had her toned abs on full display — and eats a basket of focaccia bread. This one picture basically encapsulates all my goals for Summer 2018. Also, I just need to say that focaccia is the best kind of bread. It's fluffy, has rosemary sprinkled on top, and tastes like heaven — just talking about it makes me want a whole loaf RN.  Back to the suit though: The bottoms also featured a very cheeky cut as she showered on the back of the boat.  So you know, Kourtney's 8-year-old son Mason was the genius behind her flawless Instagram photo. She confirmed this in a commenter who asked, "where are your kids?"  In fact, she recently celebrated her daughter Penelope's 6th birthday on the trip and dedicated an adorable Instagram post to her.  I think it's safe to say that Kourtney — and her kids — are thriving in Italy, eating all the bread, going on all the yachts, and serving up all the poses on their gorgeous getaway. Save some focaccia for me, plz! Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Twitter has some thoughts. It’s no secret that, in many critics’ eyes, Victoria’s Secret has struggled in the changing fashion climate. Its chief marketing officer, Edward Razek, stepped down from the company in August, following a November Vogue interview in which his comments regarding transgender models caused controversy. Over the summer, the company brought on its first openly trans model, Valentina Sampaio, and earlier this month, it released a campaign in partnership with U.K. label Bluebella that features trans and plus-size models. Photographs for the collaboration with Ali Tate Cutler (who has also modeled for Reformation’s inclusive-size collection), May Simón Lifschitz, Olivia Sang, and Laura Rakhman-Kidd mark the first time the brand has had a size- and gender-inclusive campaign. This capsule’s photos will also be the first ones with this kind of diversity to be displayed in stores.  While this seems like a huge step for the formerly stubborn brand, some are less than happy. For one: Victoria’s Secret did not hire these models—Bluebella did. Also, Twitter users have some thoughts about categorizing a size-14 model as “plus-size” in the first place. (FYI, the Bluebella and Victoria’s Secret line goes up to size XL, which, according to its own size chart, is a size 16.) She's a size 14. That's less than the average size of an American woman (which is a 16). But go off I guess. https://t.co/D4favMtexI Shame on Victoria's secret I hardly think a size 14 is a plus size!!! The average female in the uk is a size 16-18 FACT https://t.co/9sneDRjzOe PSA a size 14 is barely a plus sized woman. This is doing the bare minimum. pic.twitter.com/HiGMn4tC8M In addition to the backlash about sizing, people are not happy about some comments Cutler made in response to Alysse Dalessandro’s article “11 Reasons Your ‘Concern’ for Fat People’s Health Isn’t Helping Anyone.” She wrote, “Sorry, but I don’t care about people’s health who are fat, that’s their own prerogative and their own life to lead. They are free to make their own choices.” Then the rest of her comment continued:  Commenters were quick to jump on her past remarks.  some buried ledes here:Ali appears to have been brought on by Bluebella, with whom she's worked before, NOT by VSAli is... hmmm maybe not the best first plus representative to choose, considering she's developed a reputation as being fat-shaming (https://t.co/5q7b2Knne1) https://t.co/kwZ8JuxuFT Victoria’s Secret Hires Anti-Fat Plus-Size Model https://t.co/DEGHECf62H pic.twitter.com/GWYsBegOxv Still more fans are implying that all this adds up to equal too little, too late. It is 2019 and Victoria’s Secret JUST NOW hired a plus-size model. God damn y’all are late on this. Not to mention that said model made the comments below and she’s a size 14 (the average size for American women)#GoodbyeVS 👋 https://t.co/e4JfYuNKLl   pic.twitter.com/ZpceU9Y29C  Neither Cutler nor Victoria’s Secret have responded to the backlash.

			 Lots of see-through outfits here, guys. Since the MTV VMAs started in 1984, there have been a LOT of show-stopping, iconic, and downright bizarre get-ups that walked the carpet. Here, 35 'fits that could only be described as, well, a LOT for each year the awards have been around. And who knows what jaw-dropping ensemble 2019 will bring?  At the first-ever MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, Madonna wore this bridal dress with a “Boy Toy” belt. Joan Jett and Darlene Love wore OTT outfits with Western embroidery and metallics in 1985. Tina Turner wore a black leather jacket, matching skirt, and yellow top while accepting an award at the 1986 VMAs. Cher has worn plenty of black sheer looks, but the one she wore to the 1987 VMAs featured a bedazzled geometric pattern and a puffed tulle bustle right at the back. Cindy Lauper sparkled in this metallic dress, which featured a silver bra detail and off-the-shoulder straps in 1988. Paula Abdul‘s look for the 1989 VMAs had fringe maid of black metal chains. MC Hammer‘s metallic pants were already famous by 1990, but his cutout blazer also caught attention at that year’s VMAs. Prince wore flared red slacks with a matching lapeled vest with a white button-down to the 1991 awards show. Cindy Crawford sizzled in this strappy black gown with a see-through bodice at the 1992 show. Lenny Kravitz sported a silver vest and bell-bottoms to the 1993 VMAs. Sandra Bullock wore this two-piece coordinating top and miniskirt look to the 1994 VMAs. The girl group slipped into matching white two-piece outfits for the 1995 show, where they won an award. Geena Davis turned heads in this gold dress, which featured a completely backless design. Each of the five Spice Girls wore something unique to the 1997 VMAs: Posh wore a black bodycon dress with spiral heels, Baby wore a blue minidress with platform sneakers, Scary wore short shorts with dalmatian-print thigh-high boots and a matching duster blouse, Ginger wore an American-flag bodysuit with coordinating platforms, and Sporty wore a high-necked crop top with white track pants and tennis shoes. This was more than a decade before Old Town Road dominated the charts, but J.Lo was way ahead of the Western game in this cowboy hat and pantsuit combo at the ’98 awards.  Xtina donned this sheer animal-printed cami with pink lace trim and a matching jacket over a black mini and knee-high boots.  The three-person group matched in leather rhinestone bodices and coordinating bottoms at the 2000 VMAs red carpet. Britney Spears performed her single “Slave 4 U” in this scarf-themed outfit, which she later accessorized with a live python, in 2001. The socialite sisters matched in pink looks for the 2002 VMAs. Nicky wore a long-sleeved tunic with black thigh-high boots, while Paris slipped into a floral halter top with a napkin-hemmed skirt. Britney Spears performed with Madonna that night, so it was only fitting that she wore this white bridal look in 2003, which paid homage to Madonna’s 1984 outfit (see slide 1). Paris Hilton had nothing to hide in this completely sheer embellished dress in 2004. Lindsay Lohan went all in on leopard print in this off-the-shoulder midi dress, which she wore in 2005. Jennifer Lopez worked this metallic minidress with puffy sleeves and a matching headwrap in 2006. Rihanna showed off her banging curves in this hot-pink, form-fitting gown in 2007. The Jonas brothers were definitely coordinating in these white, gray, and black suits at the 2008 VMAs. Lady Gaga made a scene in this dramatic black feathered look at the 2009 awards show. Selena Gomez glowed in this silver gown with a thigh-high slit at the 2010 VMAs. Beyonce freaked everyone out when she revealed she was pregnant with her first child, Blue Ivy, in this one-shouldered orange dress in 2011. Taylor Swift made a huge statement in this sleek, white look with straight hair in 2012. Previously, she had rocked her signature corkscrew locks and frilly gowns. Miley Cyrus‘s sexy embellished two-piece look—with her mini space buns—signaled a new aesthetic phase for her in 2013.

			 Because nothing says sexy like a Taco Bell salsa packet!!! This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. It’s finally Spooky SZN, and you know what that means: costume-hunting time. When it comes to Halloween ensembles, there are three kinds of people in this world: 1) Those who try to look as hot as possible, 2) those who go balls to the MF wall and don’t give a f*ck how ugly they look (looking at you, Heidi Klum), and 3) those who fashion a costume out of whatever’s in their closet at the last minute (hi, it me!). You can always count on the holiday retailers to churn out some incredibly awful costumes, but the only things spookier than Halloween are the “sexy” ones. “Sexy” Taco Bell salsa packet, “sexy” shark, “sexy” Ronald McDonald...seriously, props to whoever comes up with all these because these costumes hold no bounds!! For obvious journalistic reasons, we had five women try on the most ridiculous (allegedly) sexy Halloween costumes IRL and give their *brutally* honest reviews.  First up: the Sexy Taco Bell Salsa Verde costume. Oh yes, Taco Bell really did that. It’s actually pretty cute overall, but you gotta watch the vid to find out its one very ~pointed~ flaw. Next up is sexy shark. Unlike most sexy Halloween costumes, this one will actually keep you warm, so, like, points for that, I guess! Following sexy shark is sexy hamburger clown, or as our lovely tester Mia calls it, “your deranged version of Ronald McDonald.” Yep, uh, mhm. We’ll let your form your own thoughts on this one.   Last but certainly not least is the sexy Mario costume. Bet you never thought you’d see the words “sexy” and “Mario” in the same sentence, yet here we are! And, honestly, I’m not that mad about it. And now “Mario Party” has a whole new meaning! Sorry @ Nintendo.

			 #4 makes a lot of sense, actually.  There are a LOT of rules when it comes to being part of the royal family, but because royal weddings are such a huge – and widely televised – event, there's even more specific traditions and guidelines that brides follow leading up to their nuptials and the day of their actual wedding. Scroll on for a look at the surprising, and not-so-surprising, rules.  While the bride chooses her wedding gown and works with a designer on the style, it's the Queen who has the last say. The Queen approved Kate Middleton's Alexander McQueen by Sarah Burton gown, and she did the same for Meghan Markle's yet-to-be-announced dress.   She basically gets a private sneak peek of the dress to approve it before its seen by billions(!!!) on the big day.  Although Kate Middleton's gown had a  low-cut, but still very elegant neckline, royals usually opt for ones that provide more coverage. Royal weddings are ceremonies built on centuries of tradition, and well, because the nuptials take place in a church, you won't see a lot of revealing silhouettes.  Here, then-Princess Elizabeth wore a silk Norman Hartnell dress with pearls to her 1947 wedding at Westminster Abbey.  You won’t find many strapless or sleeveless royal gowns, and that's because the brides usually choose dresses with sleeves for modesty. And, looking at previous royal weddings, it's a bit of a tradition. Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, and Kate Middleton's dresses all had sleeves of some kind, so it's likely that Meghan's will have the same.  British designer duo Elizabeth and David Emanuel created Princess Diana's dress in three months, British designer Norman Hartnell made Queen Elizabeth's, and English designer Sarah Burton brought Kate Middleton's iconic Alexander McQueen number to life.   Rumored designers for Meghan Markle's big day include Ralph & Russo (widely considered the front-runner), Erdem, and Burberry – all British designers as well.  This one seems obvious, but it goes to show that the monarchy sticks to tradition. You won't see any blush, cream, or millennial pink wedding gowns at a royal wedding. Even an off-white color would be considered boundary-pushing. Here, the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, wore a white silk and organza gown also designed by Norman Hartnell to her 1960 wedding to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones.  The wedding day is typically the first time a new royal wears a tiara. It's a privilege reserved for married women, who borrow the sparkling heirlooms from their family, their in-laws, or make a new one. Princess Diana wore the Spencer tiara that her family owned, while Kate Middleton borrowed the Cartier Halo tiara from the Queen for her wedding.  It's still unknown whether Meghan Markle will wear a tiara, or, in an unexpected break in tradition, whether she'll even wear one at all.  Yet another royal wedding tradition is that the bride's bouquet must contain myrtle — whether it's a sprig or makes up the whole bouquet. Queen Victoria, who was given a myrtle plant by Prince Albert's grandmother, started the tradition. After the wedding, the bride's bouquet is left at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. The late Queen Elizabeth I, known as the Queen Mother, was the first to do this after her 1923 wedding to  King George VI at the Abbey. Here, Camilla Parker Bowles' multicolored bouquet is pictured with myrtle flowers.  The gold royal wedding bands specifically use Welsh gold and come from a mine in North Wales. Clogau St. David's mine has provided three generations of royal wedding bands, and the reason is that the 24-carat Welsh gold has a higher percentage of pure gold than the usual 18-carat gold, which gives the jewelry its rich color.  If the longstanding tradition is any indication, it's likely that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding bands will feature this specific metal. Here, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, wears her gold band with her engagement ring.

			 You have to see this cutout situation. Emily Ratajkowski is in the upcoming Amy Schumer movie, I Feel Pretty. As a result, she attended the film's premiere in L.A. on Tuesday night, wearing this:   It's a sparkly black form-fitting Michael Kors dress with a thigh-high slit and a very well-placed cutout that sits squarely on her lower abs. Please, take another look: She paired the look with minimalist black heels and some understated, yet sparkly jewelry. This cutout is very distracting. Here, she's even pointing to the poster behind her, but, I'm telling you, the only thing anyone's looking at is this triangle-esque shape of six-pack. So, I don't know. Do you want to see more angles of the dress? Here are some more black dresses with little cutouts that you can shop if EmRata has inspired you. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 That's one way to do it, sure.  Of all the things to make it down the runway during fashion week, three-breasted models may be one of the more bizarre. Italian streetwear brand GCDS sent two models down the catwalk wearing a prosthetic third breast, which you can see clearly their under cropped sports bra tops.  The brand (the initials stand for God Can’t Destroy Streetwear) had the models wear one fake prosthetic breast between their actual breasts, and you just need to see this with your own eyes because no amount of describing does it justice. Behold:    In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, creative director  Giuliano Calza said that the collection was inspired by the idea of a future where computers no longer has to exist (god save us all), so society has to look back and relearn how to do things without them. It was very "dystopian."  “We’re a young group here — we’re all under 30 — and I wanted to talk to people our age about the future and get them thinking about plastics, water shortage and the environment," he said. "Full sustainability is impossible, and I wanted this show to be a wake-up call."  Okay, sure, idk what a third boob has to do with that but sounds good!  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 If you're not sure what to get her, you're going to want to check this list. Valentine's Day is literally right around the corner and if you have a special woman on your list, and are scratching your head at what to get her, you're gonna wanna take a quick scroll down this list of amazing gift ideas. You're welcome! A very soft thermal with roomy sleeves and a classic waffle knit pattern will be her go-to for date nights in. If she's got pierced ears, odds are she loves hoops and this resin set comes with three statement-making pairs. She'll love how warm this wrap-style puffer keeps her through the winter.  Sunnies aren't just for summer—treat her to a neutral, geometric pair she can wear all year long.  A navy PJ set with little hearts all over will make her feel super loved as she gets ready for bed.  If she's constantly updating you with how astrology is affecting her life, she's probably big into her sign, so a necklace with her constellation will win major points. A flower lover or interior design whiz will totally appreciate a set of three somewhat matched bud vases to place all around her space. In case a practical gift is more your thing, she could probably use a new wallet, and this neutral one with a cool gold metal detail will go with everything.  A fashionista needs more than just beanies to get her through the winter months, so grab her a pretty beret that will have the same toasty effect. If she's always complaining that she has nothing to wear for date nights out, impress her with this very steamy silk midi lewk. This classic gold bracelet goes great with any outfit and a major plus is that it comes engraved with the phrase "heart of gold" on the inside. A jetsetter will definitely melt at the sight of this stunning water color-inspired passport holder featuring a pretty design of the continents mixed with painted florals. She's probably already got a pair of black booties, but a merlot-colored kitten heel pair with a flirty bow detail at the back will certainly find a home in her closet fast. Sweaters can look frumpy when they don't have design elements that make them stand out—avoid that dilemma with one in a tailored fit that has delicate puff-sleeve details. She's always talking about wanting to learn more about the zodiac, so why not grab her a book that'll tell her everything she needs to know? You literally can't go wrong with a sleek shopper bag in a bright red that'll pop against any outfit. Seriously, how pretty is this keychain? It'll make any of her keys look instantly glamorous.  A fresh phone case in a celestial mixed-metal design is an obvious crowd-pleaser. A set of lip balms that give her pout a gentle splash of color as well as a super soft texture can't be a bad idea.  If she's always looking for pieces that stand out, she'll light up at this velvet bag with a tortoise ring detail. A makeup guru will appreciate this palette of highlighters in pretty gold, bronze and peach tones.

			 The Fug Girls select their favorite looks from fashion's biggest night.   Lena is admirably always very much herself on the red carpet, but this took that to a spectacular level. When she was invited to a night built around Catholicism and all but fetishizing its trappings, she used that platform to advocate for the LGBTQ people the religion’s core tenets reject. There were a lot of outfits screaming for attention, and yet Lena’s spoke the loudest of them all.   The Met brought with it many headpieces that likely weighed an excruciating ton, so Advil surely was being passed around like candy. But here, Sarah Jessica is sporting what appears to be an entire Church tabernacle on her noggin.  Richard Quinn is having a big year: He won the very first Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design and received it directly from the actual Queen herself while she sat flush with glee at his runway show. And now, Amal Clooney gave him a glittering cherry for the sundae by co-hosting the Met Gala wearing his design. It's all very exciting, and yet we wish this look were better. That train is so spectacular, but the pants land with a thud and even look a bit — gasp! — wrinkled. Whatever would Her Majesty say? We hope these wings help Katy actually fly, because she could barely walk in this and looked one hot second away from toppling over into a pile of feathers. We appreciate the fact that she never, ever phones it in, but it’s the second year in a row she’s essentially rendered herself unable to negotiate the venue without putting herself in mortal peril, and that’s a step too far for fashion, even on its most extra night.   If Katy Perry couldn't walk in her angel wings, we're not sure how Cara managed to negotiate the Met's notorious staircase given what's covering her face. Her entire self is encaged; is this a sartorial interpretation of the Spanish Inquisition? Because it’s true no one would expect that. On Twitter Sunday night, Solange asked her followers to help her choose what to wear to the Met. This look didn't win the poll — she actually ended up combining two of the runners-up — but it was the right choice for her anyway: It's beautifully unconventional while still being elegant and unforgettable.  We feel sorry for all the other women who decided to go in the sartorial direction of the Maid of Orleans, because their efforts will be judged against Zendaya's and found wanting. Simply put, she looks amazing. We'd follow her into battle any day. It might seem strange to say that a completely gold, sequined gown is simple — but please remember that Kim once basically came dressed as a floral armchair to this event, and this, comparatively, is pretty uncomplicated. It's also good. Kimberly was well served by an aesthetic wherein her clothing isn't agitating to steal focus from her face.   In case you wondered what Cardi B would look like if she dressed up as a Renaissance fertility goddess … she and Jeremy Scott have you covered. We're a little concerned that she might not be wholly comfortable, but to borrow a turn of phrase, we're going to let her gestate in peace. If more non-priest men looked like this at Church, maybe we'd go more often. Per the talking heads at E!, Selena is apparently a fairly devout Christian, which caused some conflicts for her when she was working with Coach to design her gown. While we cannot imagine that Coach's aesthetic was ever going to go into a heretical direction — can bags ever truly offend The Lord? — we also cannot imagine how everyone decided that a wilted nightgown was an exciting compromise. This is a real step forward for Ariana, who too often gets stuck in a vortex of High Ponytail/Thigh-High boots. Her gown is printed with images from the Sistine Chapel, which admittedly is very direct. But it's beautifully done, and we'll take beautifully direct over the alternative any day. OK, so the outfit has nothing to do with the forthcoming royal wedding as far as we know, but Priyanka chats about that subject constantly to the press — as would we, were our friend marrying a prince — and we like to imagine her floating into the Met and announcing that she's pretty sure Meghan's ice sculptures will be more impressive. The good news is that she'll look stunning as she does that, because this headpiece is absolutely glorious on her. If this were The Met Gala: Stuff We Found in the Hampton Court Palace Archives, then Blake would be right on the money. Henry VIII would have married her twice for this alone. Sadly, it was not, but we’re sufficiently impressed by the effort that we won’t have her thrown into The Tower. Frances McDormand is the person we would have picked to show up dressed as an ascetic nun. Throughout the last awards season, she gave off the vibe of having ZERO time for froofery and furbelows, so it was utterly astonishing to see her pop up at the Met Gala at all. If this wasn’t foretold in the actual Book of Revelations, it may need an addendum. Speaking of nuns. Personally, we would have solved this problem with a guitar. If you’re going all in on Fraulein Maria, don’t skimp on the props. Does anyone do it better? We’d say that this was like an incredibly chic Sound of Music, except we just used up our one allotted Sound of Music joke. Somehow, “She looks like the most amazing revamp of The Flying Nun” doesn’t quite sing.  We unsecretly wanted Madge to dig deep into her archives and come dressed as her entire "Like A Prayer" video or in full "Like a Virgin" mode. This is still striking, but it’s also literal in a dull way, and the workmanship isn’t particularly arresting — which means that Madonna got outdone by many of her juniors, something that should be illegal on a night whose theme was, essentially, The Early Works of Madonna. So while we want to love it ... sadly, it’s not a sufficiently triumphant next chapter in this legendary pairing. Maybe she choked. Does Madonna choke? Suddenly we’re having a crisis of our own faith. We’d never have called it, but Rita looks divine. That dress is gorgeous and colorful and capped with a headpiece that reportedly took three days to make. Imagine if Madonna had shown up in THIS — it has both the surprise factor and dangerous head spikes.  One could argue that Jared Leto is being very literal, dressing both as Jesus and a priest. But Jared dresses like Fancy Jesus Priest to pick up his dry-cleaning; this is wholly business as usual for him. Lana, on the other hand, manages both to look like the side of a religious candle and like the sartorial embodiment of what her music sounds like, all at the same time. It’s almost impressively on-brand. Several people at this event employed veils. Zoe is the only one who used one as her dress. With that duly noted, we learned from The Gospel According to Billy Joel that the sinners are much more fun, so ...  The rumor as we type this is that Scarlett is wearing Marchesa, a.k.a. the label partly funded by disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, who's been accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women, and co-founded and designed by his soon-to-be ex-wife Georgina Chapman. As such, conventional wisdom since his fall has pegged Marchesa as wholly radioactive. Scarlett, in fact, is the first A-lister or even C-lister to go there since, to our knowledge, and it is ... a curious choice at best, especially with Lena Waithe out there so elegantly championing social justice. Weirder still, the dress itself doesn’t even evoke the theme, at least not overtly. So why here, why now? What’s the message, Scarlett? Are you preaching forgiveness, or practicing forgetfulness?   In the interest of full disclosure: We have nitpicky concerns about the fit and cut here, which seem — once you strip away the ornamentation — similar to styles Rihanna favored all last summer while promoting Valerian. But the beading is undeniably intricate, and she’s absolutely pulling off Pope-chic with aplomb. Simply put, Rihanna is very, very good at embracing the costumey without letting it overshadow her essence. (Seriously, Nicki Minaj once went to the Grammys with a dude dressed AS the Pope, and Rihanna outdid her with one simple tip of her papal tiara.) And yet, it would be remiss of us not to note, in light of the ongoing discussion about Marchesa, that it’s an intriguing choice to go with Margiela at a religion-themed event, given that head designer John Galliano was once exiled from fashion after going on an anti-Semitic rant. Perhaps this entire night will engender a conversation about penance — after all, what could be more on-theme with the Catholic imagination than that?

			 Her collection of handbags is worth, like, $1 million. NBD. In March, Kylie Jenner shared a photo of her extremely organized and drool-worthy handbag collection on Instagram. The mirror pic showed off her multi-colored accessories and her comfy silk robe ensemble. But now, she's giving fans an inside look at her bag collection and insane closet with a new video from her blog. 
  In the video, she shows off her most-prized designer items (her favorite row is the Hermès row, she says). Two bags from that shelf are particularly special: a cream and tan medium-sized crocodile Birkin, which she says is the only bag she'd save if her house ever caught on fire, and a tiny hot pink version she got from Kourtney that she says she's planning to give to her daughter Stormi some day. She also highlights her collection of Louis Vuitton collabs, and a fabulous LV x Xupes bag that's custom-painted with her mom's face on it, given to her by her mom. In October, she posted a video on Snapchat of the empty closet, so now you can see just how far she's come.

			 The A/C struggle is REAL. Outside you can fry an egg on the sidewalk, but inside, you're wearing three layers and shivering at your desk. Like, how do you even dress for that?! Here, are 22 work outfits to wear this summer that'll get you through the effing hot weather and chilly A/C temps.  Want more Cosmo?  Subscribe here! Yes, you can totally wear shorts to the office! These pink ones are tailored and just the right length and look even better with a matching blazer to keep it profesh.  Stripes are a classic summer pattern. A long-sleeve wrap top looks elevated, but when paired with distressed jeans and lucite heels, you'll look so dang effortless.   The vertical stripes on this vest are elongating, while the belt makes it oh-so fancy. Lose the pants for a sexy post-work drinks lewk. (Plus, it's giving off major Meghan Markle vibes, right?)  The breezy silhouette is cool enough in the sweltering heat, but the cropped pants and three-quarter length sleeves still keep you covered in your chilly office. Opt for neutral heels so the red-hot shade really makes a statement.  A denim button-down dress is undeniably chic with the right accessories. Glam earrings, ankle-strap heels, and a top handle bag take this light-wash number to the next level.   It wouldn't be summer without a nautical moment. These airy chambray pants look great with a crisp white tee—and even better with gold jewelry and strappy slides.  A white double-breasted blazer dress that you can also wear, well, as a blazer is the definition of sophisticated. Sport it at a meeting with beige heels and a chic bag or throw it on before brunch by wearing it open with jeans and sneaks.  Hop on board the animal print trend with a snakeskin patterned midi that'll keep your legs warm. A cream-colored long-sleeve, a black bag, and strappy heels complete the whole ensemble.  This striped romper strikes the right balance of cuteness and coverage; plus, the tie-waist and statement earrings give this look extra oomph. Still feeling cold? Throw a cardigan over it and you're good to go!  We all wish we could wear our pj's to the office, but these silky striped pants are the next best thing. The vertical stripes will give you legs for days, while the lightweight fabric will keep you comfy and cool. A white crewneck tee completes the look.  A wrap is a classic silhouette, but the puff sleeves and differing thickness of the stripes on this one give it a fresh spin. Make your outfit even trendier spin by wearing see-though PVC shoes.  Trade your LBD for an LWD this season. This style has a low-key boho vibe with wide sleeves that'll catch the breeze. Dress it down with platform espadrille sneakers or up with lace-up sandals—there are really SO many ways to wear this staple.  This is one of those aughts trends we weren't sure we wanted to make a comeback, but these aren't like your *regular* cargo pants thanks to the silvery silky material. Pair it with a sleeveless knit top and black heels to really let them shine.  A pink and black polka-dotted blouse is both playful yet grown-up at the same time. Coordinate your top with a bright red mini and add some edge with chunky combat boots and black crossbody.  You can't go wrong with a solid navy dress. This maxi one is tiered and has smocked details on the front; plus, the knit material will be super comfy. White flats give it a beachy flair, but it'll also look killer with block-heel sandals if you're hitting up happy hour later. This pleated skirt gets an upgrade thanks to the gorge color blocking that channels the ocean. The midi length will keep you at a comfortable temp when that office A/C is really cranking. A white tank and moderate heels finish it off.  Pinstripes mean business. Wear this halter jumpsuit with an oversize blazer and black heels if your workplace is more professional; opt to bare your shoulders if it's more casual. The bow at the back also adds an unexpected detail when you tun around.  Like a wrap dress, but shorter! This silhouette looks so good with raw-hemmed jeans and heels, while the floral pattern channels the warmer weather outside.  Everyone needs a floral dress in their closet. It's a summer staple that's also super versatile. This one is dressy enough that you can get away with wearing white Converse. Starting to get goosebumps at your desk? Just throw a denim jacket over your shoulders.  This matching set has a pretty floral print and is made from lightweight crepe. The best part? You can wear the top and pants on their own with other pieces, so the outfit options are practically endless.  A black-and-white giraffe print is fashion-forward, while the belted waist and bow at the neck elevate this shirtdress. Wear some black ankle boots and a croc-embossed bag to finish it off.  If it's a summer Friday and you're leaving early to start your beach vacay, a belted linen dress is where it's at. The stripes and length of this style easily transition from the office to the ocean—simply trade in your lace-up shoes for slides or flip-flops.

			 These are making me hungry, TBH. If you want to take your passion for food to the next level, why not dress like your go-to dish for Halloween? Here, 21 people who channeled their fave bites to make amazing costumes.  Don't break the yolk!  English muffins might be the U.K.'s greatest contribution to society—that and Prince Harry, of course. Meghan Markle, can you back me up on this? Just make sure to keep an eye out for any monkeys.  Who knew dressing like buttery popcorn could look so cute?! Are you an extra-crunchy girl or a smooth girl?  That's quite the delicious-looking hairstyle.  You're the caffeine to my flaky pastry.  Why not celebrate Halloween with a huge slice of cake?  There's s'more where that came from.  Dressing up like a bottle of your fave hot sauce will make you feel extra spicy this Halloween.  Because that's how you (sushi) roll.  Have you ever seen a pair of Froot Loop suspenders?  If you've had a taste of Disney's magical Dole Pineapple Whip then I guarantee you'd be dressing like this too.  I avocadon't see how this could ever be a bad costume.  Ah, yes, the four major food groups.  The main reason you go to Trader Joe's, let's be honest.  Your go-to late night snack just got a whole lot spookier.  With a cherry on top. Obviously.  Pardon my French, but this costume is cute AF. So much cheesy goodness in one costume.  The three best friends that anyone could ever have.

			 Ever wondered what it'd be like to walk on clouds? Wonder no more.     If there's one thing you need to know about me, it's that I am, without a doubt, a "shoe" person. I have a three-shelf shoe rack that takes up almost all the room in my tiny-ass closet, another two-shelf one outside my apartment for sneakers and snow shoes, and even more pairs lined up underneath my sofa. (Let's just say my boyfriend, with whom I share a small studio, is not thrilled about this.)  Although I have no shortage of footwear, I had yet to stumble upon a pair that was comfortable all day long and still looked fashion-forward enough to wear with multiple outfits. That is, until I came across M.Gemi. I saw another editor sporting this brand's brightly-colored loafers on her Insta Stories and immediately looked them up. I discovered that the style, "The Felize," had more than 700 reviews and had earned an impressive a 4.5-star rating out of 5. So, of course, I HAD to give them a whirl. (As a bonus, they're also $53 off for Black Friday!)  The Felize Suede, $198 $145 SHOP NOW The best thing about these loafers is that there are so! Many! Options! They come in at least 15 shades and are offered in suede, patent leather, and a soft pebbled leather. Fair warning: they are pricier than your average flats, but that's because they're in no way "average."  The rubber pegs ensure the bottoms don't wear out easily, and while the silhouette is casual, the bright, rich colors make them ideal to wear with fancy outfits as well. I've been sporting my yellow pair to work all week—both with jeans and with dressier ensembles—and my feet have never been happier.  While they do run small, the soft material molds to your foot shape over time so they only become more comfortable the more you put them on. However, if you do prefer an overall looser fit, I would go up a half-size.  
  If you're extra picky about sizing, the website also offers a two-minute consultation where you can call or text with an expert to find your perfect fit. Shipping, returns, and exchanges are also free, so it's basically impossible to pass on getting a pair, IMO.  Still not convinced? Below, reviews from equally happy customers that might change your mind.  If you are over wearing uncomfortable shoes but don't want to sacrifice style, this is the pair for you. Also, because of the plethora of options, basically anyone can find a color and style that speaks to them. Yes, they're a little expensive, but that's why they're an investment piece for your shoe closet! If the reviews have anything to say about it, you won't regret the purchase.   Reviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.

			  Because that time of the month doesn’t also mean time to stop wearing pretty bras. If you weren’t previously aware, there are two kinds of boobs in this world: regular boobs and period boobs, aka breasts that swell up and feel like painful boulders on your chest for a week every month.  Unfortunately, there’s not a whole lot you can do to alleviate period-related breast pain (although you may be tempted to slap some ice packs on the gals). But you can make this otherwise hellish time a lot prettier and more comfortable by stocking up on soft bralettes that come packed with plenty of support to minimize as much pain as possible. Here are the best bralettes for your time of the month (or also just any time, TBH).  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? subscribe All of Lively’s bralettes are amazing, but this seamless style is a standout. Part of the brand’s busty line designed for DD and DDD cups, the thicker straps and small band across the front make this bralette both comfortable and supportive (two CRUCIAL factors). Comfortable, check; soft, check; sassy, also check! New from Richer Poorer (the brand behind THAT viral bralette), this scoop style has a low, V-cut back and little peekaboo windows on the sides. Because having period boobs does not disqualify you from being cute. Real undie gurus know that the ribbed styles from Out From Under, an in-house brand by Urban Outfitters, are the softest, best underthings you can cram in your drawer. This racerback bra is no exception, and the cut makes it supportive enough to handle even the heaviest, bounciest period boobs. Beloved with a 4.5-star rating on Amazon, this lacy option from Hanky Panky has soft, unlined cups and a thick bottom band (hi, support). Any bralette that has its own cult following is good enough for your period boobs, and this one routinely sells out—it’s that good. Its biggest selling point is that you won’t take it off as soon as you get home because you’ll forget you have it on. The band provides support without digging into your rib cage, and the soft cotton cups will stretch to accommodate slightly swollen, pre-period breasts. You could wear sports bras throughout your period...or you could wear this (much cuter) bralette from Everlane. Made with soft supima cotton, this bra is cozy enough to coddle your most painful boobs and has key features, like adjustable straps and a clasp band. What helps period boobs feel less painful is support, according to New York–based ob-gyn Dr. Rebecca Brightman—but you don’t need underwire to get that. A longline bra with a thicker band works perfectly fine because there’s more material to work with. (Added bonus? These longer pieces basically double as shirts.) While you’re getting rid of wires, why not also get rid of seams? That’s the thinking behind this little number from ThirdLove, a brand you’ve probably seen on your Facebook or Instagram feeds that’s generally great at making comfy bras. This option—which basically is just some fabric, nothing else—is even comfier. If lace is more your style, this other longline bra from Madewell is a good option. The other benefit of lace, versus cotton, is that all the little seams in the fabric provide additional support. Two birds (sexiness and support), one bra. With more than 170 mostly glowing reviews, this cami bralette is a favorite among Amazon reviewers. It’s simple, straightforward, and no-fuss, so it works for any time of the month, and it comes with removable pads for days when you need a little extra room. Lonely makes beautiful lingerie for all times of the month, your ~special~ time included. This soft-cup style with gently molded cups adds extra support and looks cute at the same time. Boom. Those in the know know that Aerie has been making some of the best undies and bras for a long time. The brand has tons of bralettes to choose from, but this lightly padded halter option is especially good for period boobs because it’s extra supportive. Bless. This wireless, deep-V from Lively is great for when you have period boobs but also want to remember you’re a sexy woman with cleavage for days. Just because your boobs hurt and your body’s going through a tiny war doesn’t mean you can’t wear low-cut tops. This bralette is for those times. Reformation’s whole deal, aside from creating Cool Girl™ clothes, is that everything the brand makes is sustainable. Made from recycled lace, the support seam-work and thick straps on this bra are *perfect* for the extra support you’ll need come period time. Saving the planet and feeling ~chic~ are just added bonuses. This bra is designed for “low-impact” exercise, so in this case, let’s assume that means it’s suitable for power-walking and climbing up and down stairs—activities that are slightly more painful when your boobs hurt. If you feel ~weird~ wearing a sports bra under your regular clothes, this is a good compromise because it’s basically its own cute outfit. This bralette is one of those rare cases where the thing everyone is wearing on Instagram is actually good. The band is extremely supportive without squeezing your ribs to oblivion, and the cotton on the cups is extra soft and flexible. JFYI, this option may not be for you if your boobs swell beyond DD cup size—but a little over-the-cup spillage is en vogue these days, right? This is a completely unproven theory, but wearing fun underwear makes your day better. If you believe in this, a fancy but very cute bra may be the key to less awful period boobs. In all seriousness, this embroidered bralette does have some key functionality: The laces in the front mean you can loosen and tighten to adjust cup size, the longline provides extra support, and all that seaming provides even more support. Another seamless option, but this one has a clasp—meaning it’s about as adjustable as a bralette can be. The ribbed fabric makes this option extra stretchy and supportive, two qualities that are extremely valuable if you’re experiencing period boobs. The scoop neckline and back also give it a ~youthful~ feel, which is great because you shouldn’t have to sacrifice style for a well-functioning bra.

			 Needless to say, fans are outraged. Only someone with seriously impaired vision — or someone just looking to get a rise out of people online — would dare call Selena Gomez ugly. But that’s just what Dolce & Gabbana designer Stefano Gabbana did on Instagram, and he’s invoked the wrath of Selenators everywhere. As first reported by the Instagram account Diet Prada, Gabbana commented on a post from The Catwalk Italia, which showed Gomez wearing different red dresses.  "È proprio brutta!” he commented, which roughly translates from Italian to “she’s really ugly!” He also responded to a commenter who said she “looks like a Pomeranian dog,” replying, “hahahahahaha is true hahahaha.”  As PopCrave notes, Gabbana has a history of making rude comments on celebrities’ Instagram accounts; he’s also feuded with Miley Cyrus and her brother, Braison. People adds he’s also recently made a nasty comment about Kate Moss, plus made controversial arguments against in vitro fertilization and gay parenting. He’s also fought back against critics over his label's dressing Melania Trump, and Dolce & Gabbana even designed #BoycottDolceGabbana shirts in response. But this time, Gabbana has pissed off Selena Gomez fans, and that may have been a bridge too far. Her fans have trashed him on Instagram and Twitter. Imagine calling this woman ugly 😂😂 Someone get Stefano Gabbana off social media. pic.twitter.com/F9UMlvwRGu Dolce & Gabbana has not issued a response to the backlash, and neither has Gabbana himself. But given his history of trolling on Instagram, it’s unlikely Gabbana will stop now. In fact, here's the gross thing he posted in response to Internet critics last year. Update 6/14: Gabbana has since doubled-down on his original insult, appearing to mock Gomez's fans in his Instagram Stories. On Thursday, he screenshotted his OG comment with crying-laughing emojis and the words, "MY NAME IS SELENA!!! #saysorrytome," and, "Omfg #pleasesaysorrytoselena." A second snap, most likely from a fan, showed Gomez wearing Dolce & Gabbana with the words, "@dolcegabbana YOU SUCK," written in yellow. Gabbana appeared to screenshot this image, and super-impose more crying-laughing emojis.

Wonder Woman, has always been big into fitness. "Especially with having a mother who was a PE teacher, I was exposed to an active lifestyle from an early age,” Gadot said in a statement. “Through fitness, I have found that I gain strength, endurance and confidence, and I couldn’t imagine a better partner than Reebok to join me on this journey.”  The choice to work with Gal, a statement from Reebok said, was part of a "commitment to empowering women." She joins a team of other badass ladies, including Ariana Grande, Gigi Hadid, and Victoria Beckham. “We look to partner with women who instill confidence in all generations to take risks and to keep pushing, all while making a positive difference in the world,” said Todd Krinsky, GM of the performance business unit at Reebok. “Her relentless spirit and natural leadership have already captivated and inspired millions and we believe that this is just the starting point. Through fitness, we know that we have the power to change lives and we are elated to have such a powerhouse in our corner to tell this story.”   I’m pumped about my new partnership with @Reebok!

			 Styles so cute and trendy, you won't want to take them off.   Working out can be a chore, but figuring out what clothes to wear while doing it doesn't have to be. Here, 18 need-to-know activewear brands that are so cute and versatile, you'll want to wear 'em well after your gym session.  When Khloé Kardashian first launched Good American in 2016, it focused on denim, but it has since expanded and, most recently, got into activewear. The styles come in sizes XS through 4XL and feature bold prints like leopard and camouflage, but there are also more subdued solid styles with black, white, and gray color blocking.  The brand Alala was inspired by the streets of New York City so that even your workout clothes make you look put together when you walk out the door. It offers styles with mesh details (like this bold blue sports bra, here), breezy openings, and woven textures that make even a solid-colored matching set not so basic.  Yogis everywhere can attest to the quality of Alo Yoga's pieces; the fashionable cutouts, colors, and seam placement are really just an added bonus. Leggings come in sizes 00 to 14 and will feel like a second layer of skin—without sticking to you when you sweat.  Outdoor Voices was created in 2013 with your old-school rec center in mind. “Remember back to your YMCA days?" the founder asked in an interview. "That’s the kind of activity that we want to capture.” The brand's signature color-blocked leggings and bras are a celebrity fave, but the functional details like zip closures and mesh backing will get you through even the most intense workout. You also get a pretty cool tote bag with any purchase—just sayin'.  Year of Ours, a Los Angeles-based company, offers unique designs (like the asymmetrical sports bra and ribbed leggings here) for every type of scenario, whether you're working up a sweat, running errands, or just relaxing. The brand also has sweat sets, shorts, bodysuits, tops, and more if you like the athleisure vibe. It also recently launched extended sizing, so you can find styles ranging from XXS to 2X.  While you might be familiar with the brand's logo sweatshirts, Champion is also a good go-to for activewear. If you're into that "off-duty model" aesthetic, then get yourself this trendy black and white spotted look, featuring soft jogger pants you won't want to take off. Sweaty Betty launched in 1998 as a response to all the "masculine and shapeless" activewear at the time.  The label's got you covered for every type of activity including yoga, tennis, skiing, or swimming, but if you're a runner who isn't deterred by cold weather, then you'll definitely want to check out the thermodynamic styles. They'll hold in the perfect amount of warmth without causing you to completely overheat.  If your main concern is getting the proper support you need, look no further than the Nola Activewear collection from Addition Elle. The line features no shortage of supportive sports bras fit for low-, medium-, and high-intensity workouts. From padded to non-padded, underwire to seamless, or strappy to basic, there's an option for everyone's preferences.  If you're all about lightweight, breezy materials, Puma is for you. Pieces feature everything from flat seams for reduced irritation on the move to breathable lining when you're sweating up a storm.  Koral activewear is not only moisture-wicking, anti-pilling, quick drying, and anti-bacterial (to name a few benefits), it's also edgy and stylish enough to wear throughout the day. If you have things to do even after squeezing in a workout, you'll look cute without having to schlep a different outfit to the gym.  Nike has a plethora of activewear, but when it comes to outerwear, the brand's offerings are protective and functional in any type of weather. Styles include lightweight windbreakers, bombers, and sherpa jackets.  LNDR's aesthetic is minimal and almost futuristic with its signature colored panels that outline your muscles and move with you. The stretch will make each piece feel like it was molded specifically for your body, and, consequently, everything will stay in place, even in super intense studio sessions.  Since partnering with Adidas in 2004, Stella McCartney has brought her fashionable designs to the activewear world. The label's aesthetic is sporty but delicate and often features playful patterns and bold colors, as evidenced here with the bright-red and cobalt-blue of this tank and tennis skirt set.  You won't ever want to wear anything else once you experience the softness of Athleta's fabrics. If you're looking for activewear that not only does the job (i.e. wicks sweat, stays in place, etc.) but also happens to be insanely comfortable, then this is the brand for you.  Zella's styles are pretty traditional when it comes to color, but if you gravitate toward black, gray, or other neutral hues, then it's definitely worth looking into. The label is perfect for those who appreciate simplicity combined with subtle details like mesh panelling or reversible designs.  The Upside is an Australian-based activewear company that offers cute and cheery designs, but also doesn't skimp out on technical performance. You'll definitely make a statement at the gym wearing its styles featuring adjustable straps and drawstrings, removable cups, and rubber seams that prevent slippage.  Universal Standard is known for its inclusive sizing and minimal designs. Its activewear collection, which launched in January 2018, is no exception. The simple silhouettes (like this bodysuit, for instance) are perfect if you're no-fuss, but the bold primary and secondary colors of its pieces still lend a sense of style.  Victoria's Secret PINK Lightly Lined Sports Bra, $27 SHOP NOW Victoria's Secret PINK's lightly lined sports bras are top-rated for a reason. Reviewers rave about the comfy fit, the fabric quality and the minimal padding for low-impact workouts. The rest of the brand's workout gear comes in fun prints like rainbow and plaid and also an impressive range of solid colors in almost every style.

			 Who knew Joey was so high fashion?  Balenciaga, the brand best known for selling ridiculously-priced glorified IKEA bags and hot-pink platform Crocs, is at it again with a $9,000 parka that's literally just seven jackets sewn together. But the Internet was quick to catch on that the look is VERY reminiscent of that of a certain character from Friends.   Balenciaga’s inspiration for their new $8000 coat... pic.twitter.com/hVLa3hBYjP  The parka debuted at the brand's Fall 2018 runway show in March during Paris Fashion Week, and, now, it's available for pre-sale on Matches Fashion and Barney's. ("Finally!" said no one ever.) Although the price comes out to roughly $1,285 per layer, on the upside, at least wearing it will make it incredibly easy to sneak snacks into a movie theater? It goes to show you that sometimes fashion can be a gorgeous haute couture gown that takes months to create, and other times it's literally putting one jacket on top of the other to create one giant f*cking parka. But let's give credit where it's due—because when it comes to layering clothes, Joey was WAY ahead of the trend.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 You're gonna need a bigger closet...  Nordstrom's epic Winter Sale is here, folks! But what does that mean? Items are up to 40% off from February 15-24. Happy post-Valentine's Day to you, am I right?! Looking for a sultry outfit? A red velvet dress paired with leopard print heels makes the ultimate statement.  Boots with a thick sole will give you traction in slippery conditions; plus, you can wear it when the weather warms up with a cute slip dress or jean skirt.  A pendant necklace will look amazing whether you wear it with all your other gold jewelry or on its own. It might not actually unlock anything, but at least it's cute.  A cropped blazer with a windowpane pattern is a great versatile piece. Pair it with matching pants to the office, or a pair of high-waisted jeans on the weekend.  Why go for a basic purse when you can buy a cylindrical snakeskin one instead? You can also unhook the shoulder strap and wear it as a top handle. A belted jumpsuit with nautical stripes will inspire you to finally book that seaside vacation.  A silk long-sleeve shirt in a trendy shade of pink looks just as good with light-wash jeans and flats as it does with a midi skirt and heels.  A velvet dress isn't new territory, but one with a high-neck and flutter sleeves feels fresh and unexpected. The thick fabric mixed with the flowery pattern makes it a great transitional style in between seasons.  A multi-colored camera bag will add fun to any outfit. This one is also convertible (yay!) so it can be worn as a crossbody or as a fanny pack.  Leopard print is having a definite moment so get in on the trend in the form of these comfy sock booties.  Switch up your plain denim with a fun black and red skirt. It'll definitely stand out in a sea of blue jeans.  An LED Lumee case will create amazing lighting for every selfie—i.e. you'll look absolutely GLOWING. Trust me.  Add flair to your denim and snag these bold raw-hemmed ones.  A classic trench coat is a definite wardrobe staple. Layer thick knit sweaters under it in the winter and wear it over a T-shirt and jeans come spring.  If you're a fan of stud earrings, but want to change up your style, opt for a cute pair of gold hearts like these.   This belted style with a plunging necklines proves that a jumpsuit can look just as fancy as a dress. Pair it with simple black heels and you'll be the most elegant person in the room.  Wear a pair of high heels with a navy flounce-hem mini for a fancy night out or some trendy boots for a cute daytime look.  Always in a rush to get out the door? A pair of red mules are easy to throw on yet they'll complete your look with a pop of color.    A leather style in this shade of cream will stand out among all your black clothes. This one, with its fitted silhouette and edgy zippers, will quickly become your favorite outerwear piece.  Teddy coats (and really anything fuzzy) are trending, so get yourself a cute bag that goes with the rest of your textured winter styles.  If you're sick of skinny jeans, '70s-inspired high-waisted pants will be your new best friend.  A faux-fur double-breasted jacket will save your life in icy winds; plus, the pale blush color is basically a neutral that complements everything.

			  Leggings are crucial, people.  College can be just a liiittle overwhelming.  I mean, you’re tasked with figuring out what you want to do with your life while also balancing your classes, papers, tests, and possibly a part-time job. Also, on top of all this, you’re probably going out, socializing, and making those ~mems~. It’s a LOT. But treating college students with thoughtful or practical gifts can help them get through those four years (or however long they’re planning to stay). Here, 35 gift ideas, from Febreze to throw blankets, that’ll make their day-to-day college experience less stressful.   They’ll be forever grateful for a Keurig that makes a fast cup of joe when they’re cramming for an exam. Plus, the mini size is perfect for a college dorm or smaller room. They won’t have a cluttered desk thanks to this rose-gold tray that fits all sorts of office supplies. Cooking can be a hassle when you have a shared kitchen, but if they’re in their own apartment on or off campus, they’ll definitely use a cookware set—especially one in a gorge blue shade. Workout tanks are ideal for any kind of activity, whether it’s running, lifting, or yoga. This set includes three pieces that are so comfy, they’ll want to wear ’em to class too. Speaking of being comfortable, a pair of leggings is the perfect present for students. It has a convenient phone pocket and lots of stretch, and they can wear it to the gym, in their dorm, and everywhere in between. Laundry day in college = lugging it to a washing machine in the basement or a laundromat five minutes away. It’s annoying. A quick spritz of this guy, and lightly worn clothing will smell like new so they can procrastinate just a bit longer on washing their things. Dorm rooms can be uninviting when the walls are stark white and there aren’t any decorations. Liven theirs up with a trio of baby succulents! Sometimes a fresh set of crisp sheets and pillowcases makes a world of difference. This percale set will make them feel like they’re in a luxurious hotel and not sharing their space with a roommate. College events are always happening (especially if they’re involved in Greek life), so a Rent the Runway subscription will help them pick out clothes for both casual and fancy occasions. They can wear something new without overwhelming their small closet. College classes can be back-to-back and sometimes they’ve gotta get to their next one waaay across campus. A pair of super-comfortable, bouncy sneaks definitely makes the trek easier. They just want to feel stress-free after exams? A beauty kit with skincare and makeup essentials like firming moisturizer, collagen eye pads, highlighter, and more will make them look well-rested and radiant. You can’t get through the dorm room experience without a plethora of Command hooks. They save floor space, they’re easy to use, and some styles are upgraded with matte metal or brass so they look polished. This black double hook is perfect for scarves, keys, or whatever else they wanna hang up. A soft quilted backpack will make carrying all their sh*t so much more manageable, and this style will last even beyond college. Whether they have existing travel plans or not, a minimal carry-on will inspire them to book that trip. Away’s luggage also comes with handy international adapters and an external charger. Those college dorms are always so cold, especially in the wintertime, so a plush heated blanket will be a game changer in their lives. A Bluetooth speaker is basically a must-have when they’re having friends over, but they can also take this one on the go because of its small size and leather handle. A stylish photo book they can keep their most prized pics in makes a great gift—and it happens to look so good on any table. Give them a comfy striped pj set for those late-night study sessions or just for when they don’t want to leave their room. A journal is a great present where they can take time away from their busy schedules, self-reflect, and write down their goals. Polaroids aren’t going away anytime soon! They’ll love having this mini Instax around to document all the good times. A flexible pair of metallic flats is ideal for long days spent on their feet around campus, but they’re pretty enough to wear out too. An easy way for a college student to save money is doing their own nails. Give them the gift of an at-home nail salon with a kit that includes an LED lamp, nail file, acetone remover, gel nail polish, and more. With a car charger, wall charger, and external charger, they can make sure their phone is on 100 percent at all times. Give them a little piece of home with a candle from their state. Each one includes distinct scents representative of each place; this one features notes of “honeysuckle, lavender, and violets with hints of grain fields.” Coffee not for them? A pretty mug made for sipping hot tea will be their go-to whenever they need a little pick-me-up. They love representing their school, so get them a shirt with their college colors, like a cute striped tee. They might not have a lot of time to grab something, but a lightning-fast blender gives them a healthy smoothie they can take on the go. Whether it’s raining or snowing or just plain chilly, you can’t go wrong with a classic combat boot that is waterproof and holds up through anything. A kit that has coasters, a laundry guide, a mending kit, stain remover, a lint brush, thank-you notes with envelopes, folder labels, and more will make their journey into adulthood a little more seamless. An easy cookbook that has recipes for healthy snacks, meals, and desserts will get their culinary skills goin’. For their self-care Sundays, a kit that includes body balm and an exfoliating coffee scrub is one they’ll use consistently. A small but sentimental bracelet that motivates them on even the worst of days is definitely a special present. A college student can NEVER have too much Tupperware, and if they usually meal-prep, these blue-accented glass ones will keep them organized. A personalized everyday piece of jewelry is always a thoughtful gift. You can also choose the metal and chain to get the perfect color and length. Downing eight glasses a day is a little harder than you think, but a water bottle like this makes sure even the busiest college student gets proper hydration.

			 So soft, so cozy, so stylish.  Cooler weather will be here before you know it, which means there’s no better time to stock up on boots, pants, jackets, and, of course, sweaters. And although it’s important to make sure your wardrobe is full of classic basics and neutrals that last a lifetime, sometimes you just want something trendy. And for that, you shouldn’t spend a lot of money. Which is why we were grateful this weekend to be introduced to the ridiculously affordable options from English Factory. Beloved by fashion bloggers and avid Instagrammers alike, English Factory is one of those under-the-radar brands that has “cool girl” written all over it. When Arielle Noa Charnas of Something Navy posted a picture in one of the brand’s sweet polka-dot sweaters this weekend, it immediately sold out on Amazon.   Guess which piece is from @amazonfashion? I’m obsessed and am having the best time finding the cutest pieces to add to our wardrobes (and with your feedback from last time, great price points as well). #founditonamazon #ad A post shared by  Arielle Charnas (@ariellecharnas) on Sep 29, 2019 at 7:49am PDT Since Charnas’s Insta-worthy sweater is out of stock, we sifted through English Factory’s inventory to see which other items might be worth coveting for fall. From tartan skirts and fringed pullovers to sweaters adorned with  delightful pom-poms, there’s almost too much to choose from. The best part? Most items are available for less than $100. We’ll double-tap to that!  Shop our favorite pieces, below.

Show off your pedicure with these simple leather bbs that come in four other hues and have a cushioned footbed.  Celebrate the warm weather with a tri-color gingham bikini that'll look cute in all those dreamy beach 'grams.   This satiny midi style will look so good with strappy sandals and a lightweight camisole.  This polka-dot style holds all your cards and not only looks cute, but also has a whopping 12 slots.  Clogs are IN, have you heard? Opt for this two-strap black pair with a lower heel so your feet will be trendy but comfy.  These jeans'll feel like a second skin thanks to their incredible stretch, and they also have subtle embroidered flowers on the legs.  Canvas backpacks are great and all, but a leather one just seems so much more grown-up. This soft gray option has three zipper compartments for max storage.  You already have enough blue jeans, so go for a bright pair that'll pair just as well with a white T-shirt as it does with a striped top.

Pair this hot pink number with clear heels and hoops for a gorgeous reception look. This fun, flowy dress pairs great with dancing shoes. Oh, and statement earrings.  Black-tie affair coming up?

			 That's royal diplomacy for you! During their royal visit to Northern Ireland (their first official trip abroad as a married couple), Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stopped over at the British Ambassador's official residence in Dublin for a garden party. The royals love a good garden party, after all!  For the occasion, Markle chose a high-waisted, A-line LBD with pockets and a simple belt detail, which was designed by Emilia Wickstead. And yes, that's the same London-based designer who allegedly claimed Markle's Givenchy wedding gown was a rip-off of one of her own bridal designs.  Back in May, news sources claimed that Wickstead had said the gown was "identical" to one of her own designs, and that "a lot of commentators" were saying so too. The Mail also said that Wickstead criticized the fit of the gown and Markle's hair.  However, the designer — who is also one of the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton's go-to designers — denied these allegations against her with an official statement on Instagram. She says that she was "saddened by commentary that has appeared in the press and on-line." "Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex looked absolutely beautiful on her wedding day and I have the utmost admiration and respect for her," she continued. "I do not think her wedding dress was a copy of any of our own designs." A post shared by Emilia Wickstead (@emiliawickstead) on May 27, 2018 at 9:33am PDT So then, the outfit certainly seems like a low-key, classy way for Meghan to say "apology accepted." And also, she looks great.  This actually isn't the first time the Duchess has worn an all-black Emilia Wickstead ensemble. A month before the royal wedding even took place, she attended a church service in honor of Anzac Day on April 25th at Westminster Abbey in a two-piece Emilia Wickstead crepe look.

			 Consider this your primer on the royal bling. You already know everything there is to know about the royal wedding festivities and Meghan Markle's bridal gown, but have you even thought about Meghan and Harry's wedding rings?!?! If not, no reason to panic. Scroll on to get your knowledge on. 
  The company designed Meghan's engagement ring in 2017, according to CNN. One made of Clogau-Welsh gold, as is royal wedding tradition that began in 1923 with the Queen Mother. The gold is a gift from the Queen. Prince William has never worn a wedding ring, reportedly because he's not a jewelry person. Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth's husband, doesn't wear one, either. Apparently, this is because male members of the British upper class and aristocracy haven't historically done this and it didn't become popular for men in England, in general, to wear wedding bands until after World War II. Interesting, right? Prince Charles, who is married to Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, wears a wedding ring (he also wore one when he was married to Princess Diana).  Despite the fact that his best man, William, doesn't wear a band, Harry reportedly likes jewelry and wants to. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 But it makes total sense.  In an interview with Harper's Bazaar Australia, designer Jayson Brunsdon revealed that Princess Diana avoided wearing Chanel after her divorce, because it was a reminder of her ex-husband Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, the woman with whom he had an affair that later became very public.  The Australian designer assisted styling the Princess during her last visit Down Under in 1996 — the same year she and Charles divorced — and he chose a pair of Chanel shoes to pair with her Versace skirt. "She said, 'No, I can’t wear linked C’s, the double C,'" Brunsdon told Harper's Bazaar. "I asked why, and she said, 'It’s Camilla and Charles.'" He remembers the shoes having the bold Chanel logo on them in gold. "I think for photo optics, people would have honed in on that considering it was so fresh after the divorce as well," he said. Princess Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, but Charles' affair with Camilla, among other things, strained their marriage and led to their eventual separation.  In 1995, Princess Diana sat down for her first solo interview with the BBC, in which she famously said, "There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."   And, apparently, Diana was upset enough about their relationship that she swore off wearing Chanel.  This instance wasn't the first time Diana showed her disdain for the letter C. During her marriage to Charles, he wore cufflinks engraved with the same letters interlocked, which she understood to mean he was still in love with Camilla,  whom he dated before he married Diana.

			 Fuzzy = comfy and comfy = the best possible thing to be. I love being cozy—it's probably the best feeling in the world. So when I recently noticed that all my favorite retail stores were filling up with a material called "teddy" fabric (named after a soft teddy bear, like, omg), I knew I needed to stock the f*ck up on everything. And, listen, I'm not here to tell you what to do, but, if you like to be all snuggly and warm in the winter (which, who doesn't?!?!) maybe you should get in on the action too? Let's back up and understand how we got to this very important moment in fashion history. You may recall teddy fabric as the stuff that's used to make super fluffy winter socks: Get you some of these socks, people!! They're awesome. Or maybe you remember the Teddy coat—a cold-weather jacket that started popping up everywhere in 2016 and 2017 (BTW, that trend is still going strong). You know you want in on this teddy coat situation. But now you can find it in tons of other clothing—including (but not limited to!) loungewear, sweaters, sweatshirts, other kinds of jackets, shoes, and bags! FYI: Sometimes e-comm sites call the material by its "teddy" name, other times they call it "sherpa" or just plain "fuzzy"—but they're all talking about the same thing.  No matter what they're calling it, the sheer volume and variety of these ultra plush items is actually a dream come true. So...shop with me? Here's just a bunch of teddy stuff that I like and maybe you will like it also. How do you feel about teddy tops? What of these super soft shorts and pants? Can I interest you in some plush sherpa bags? How about some fluffy winter accessories? Anything else?

			 There's no graceful way to pick your shorts out of your crotch. Or is there?   Problem #1: They're super loose by the end of the day.  They fit great in the morning, but by the end of the day, they're sagging. No one likes to keep pulling up their pants, people!  Stretchy materials will hold their shape much better than those without.  Problem #2: They're showing off a little more of your *ass-ets* than you'd like.  There's no worse feeling than shorts fitting across your waist perfectly and then realizing there's not enough fabric to cover your behind (aka your butt is left hanging out in the back).  If this happens, you have two options: Find a longer style (Bermuda shorts will totally be a *thing* this year, trust me), or go up a size. If you opt for the latter, the shorts will fit across your butt and then you can get them taken in at the waist by a tailor. But, important note: If you love yourself a cheeky pair of shorts, keep doing you!  Problem #3: You're struggling with annoying thigh-chafing.  Your thighs rubbing together can cause some serious redness and discomfort. This can happen with any outfit with bare legs, so it's a common occurrence when wearing shorts.  The most straightforward solution is to wear longer shorts, but that shouldn't stop you from wearing the style you want! There are plenty of products out there that cut down on friction and prevent or minimize irritation.  Problem #4: They constantly ride up.  If they keep getting scrunched up on one or both sides—or they're giving you dreaded camel toe—that can be frustrating. This problem is almost inevitable because you're moving around all day, but only to a certain degree. If your shorts keep getting stuck, you may want to consider a looser style like boyfriend shorts or ones that are more flowy—i.e., they won't lodge themselves places they have no right to be.  Problem #5: The waistband is cutting into your sides.  No one likes bottoms that are too tight around the middle. If they're digging into your waist, it make things very uncomfy.  Choose high-waisted shorts for a smoother silhouette. They also happen to be trendy and many styles include stretch for a form-fitting, comfortable feel.  
 Problem #6: They wrinkle like crazy.  You know how it goes: Your shorts are fine when they're fresh out of the wash and when you're standing, but then as soon as you sit down, the front goes to sh*t. Wrinkles. Everywhere.  Unfortunately, wrinkles are pretty much unavoidable, but they are less noticeable if you stick to thicker, textured fabrics like lace, tweed, or denim. Patterns also help mask wrinkles.  
  Problem #7: Everyone can see your underwear and/or underwear lines.  Lighting is everything, and sometimes when you're getting dressed in your dimly lit apartment in the morning, you might not notice that your underwear is showing—until you're in public. (Been there, girl.) Or even if your bottoms aren't see-through, they might be showing major VPL (that's visible panty lines, FYI).  The next time you are shopping for light-colored anything, keep in mind that transparency is often a combination of  thinner fabrics and a tighter fit. The more form-fitting something is, the thicker you want the fabric to be to keep it from becoming see-through. That said, laser-cut underwear that matches your skin tone will help your shorts seem less transparent than they really are.

			 The Marco Marco runway at NYFW broke some major barriers. Over the weekend, Los Angeles-based designer Marco Marco unveiled his newest collection as part of New York Fashion Week–and it was a boundary-breaking runway, because all 34 models cast identify as transgender. Though it's not uncommon for trans models working in fashion to choose not to disclose their gender identity (and to be clear, nor should they have to) it's almost certainly the first time a major show on the main fashion week circuit featured no openly cisgender models. “I wanted to create a space to celebrate trans bodies," designer Marco Morante told Mic. "This was an opportunity for their presence to be undeniable and reinforce that trans is beautiful.” Among the model lineup, Youtube star and influencer Gigi Gorgeous walked the runway wearing a metallic mini skirt, sky high embellished heels, and a black top with sheer details. Actress Trace Lysette, best known from the Amazon series Transparent, also strutted down the runway and posted an inspiring message on Twitter. "At 36-26-40 I’ve never been model industry standard, and I don’t want to be," she wrote. "I love my thickness. Thanks Marco Marco for embracing ALL types of beauty." Others walking in the show included Pose actresses Dominique Jackson and Angelica Ross, Carmen Carrera, Geena Rocero, Hanson Gobron, Aydian Dowling, and and Laith Ashley, a model, singer, and activist for trans rights.   Many who attended the show used the hashtag #TransIsBeautiful, which was started by Laverne Cox in 2015. Cox also attended the show, and wrote on Instagram that it felt like "yet another fulfillment of the empowerment of trans beauty this hashtag is meant to celebrate and engender."

			 All the fashion hits and misses from MTV's big night. Tiffany was the host of the show, and ergo it's right and proper that she showed up looking like a queen. This is glam, dramatic, fun, and just a little bit sexy — exactly the recipe you want to cook up for MTV. We didn't anticipate thinking, "Yara Shahidi's next project should be a remake of Working Girl" today, but here we are. She carries this suit with elan — a feat beyond most women, both now and the first time these pants were in style. Mandy spends her days playing relative good girl Rebecca on This Is Us, so it makes sense that she might want to edge out her personal style off set. And we feel her, but this bodycon mini is a tad too futuristic.  Behold, the rare black ruffled sea goddess, using sparkles and plumage to lure unsuspecting prey. Tessa had one of the very best red-carpet moments of 2017, wearing Rosie Assoulin to the Emmys. This look, however, from the same designer manages somehow to be underwhelming and overwhelming at the same time.  In fairness, we believe this was the ONLY velvet jumpsuit deployed at this event, but we can't deny that it's a good one. The MTV Movie & TV Awards is the ideal place for the star of a CW show to burst out the fun mini-dress; its storied history is littered with them. Unfortunately, this frock is neither mini (not a deal-breaker), nor fun (more of an issue). Instead, it's a mishmash of trends: lace, florals, transparency, a huge slit up the side, and possible short-shorts lurking underneath it all. Her Riverdale alter-ego, Veronica,  never would allow this.  Picture it: Our hero and heroine hate each other, get shipwrecked together, then — right as they're being rescued — realize they've fallen in love. Before they go, they approximate a wedding out of whatever they and the rescue copter have on hand, including this gown, and are married by an Internet-ordained coconut. Where's Netflix when you need it? Honestly, this would have been lovely as a floor-length gown at the Emmys, but it works just as well as a sassy mini for MTV. If only it were one of those magic dresses that can be four different  things; then maybe we'd see it four different times.  Kim is extremely consistent with her silhouettes; this is a style we've seen a zillion times before, for things as quotidian as taking her kids to dance class. But here's where we're flummoxed: Kim previously has been taken to task for cultural appropriation and, specifically, for referring to her cornrows as "Bo Derek braids" — a whiff she continues to double-down on. To what bone-headed end, Kim?  The folks at August Getty specified that this frock is an "archival teacup dress," and its skirt does recall a charming piece of drinkware. She looks fantastic, like one of the cups from Beauty and the Beast's enchanted castle, all grown up.  Listen, Alison's top half looks great. That high pony is fab, and this dress's bodice is adorably mod. Unfortunately, the rest of her looks like every other starlet and celebrity on every red carpet for the last five years. We're sorry for making you the poster girl for this particular issue today, Alison, but when is this endless sheer trend going to end? This should be impossible. Chadwick is wearing a matching denim jacket and jeans, depicting ... who even knows. A Monet? A view of George Clooney's villa on Lake Como? Whatever it is, it shouldn't look so damned good on a human being. But then again, Chadwick Boseman might not be a human being; it's sincerely possible he's an actual god.

			 She looks amaze, though. As you may know, the theme for this year's Met Gala is "Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination." So, plz explain to me what about Kylie Jenner's outfit is about that? Kylie looks amazing here, so no shade, but, I'm just curious. Either way, she also posed with her baby-daddy Travis Scott on the carpet, and they looked v. cute together. Speaking of Stormi, Kylie literally gave birth three months ago, and here she is looking flawless, so major props for that. I would be wearing sweats. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 "I'm wearing an Eritrean princess dress, and I'm proud of it!" Tiffany Haddish just hit graced the Oscars red carpet in a traditional dress from her father's home country of Eritrea in East Africa. Last week, she told Entertainment Tonight that she wanted Oprah's advice on what to wear to the awards show. "Oprah, should I wear this Eritrean African dress to the Oscars on the red carpet to represent my daddy?" she said. "Because my daddy from Eritrea and he passed away, and I want to pay respect. I want to show the world."  OH MY GOD TIFFANY HADDISH!!! 💗💗💗💗 pic.twitter.com/6uGBH0SxpV And at the Oscars, she stayed true to her word and showed up wearing just that. She wore a gorgeous traditional white Eritrean gown (also called a Zuria or a Kaba) with black and gold embroidery and a matching black cape. But what really pulled her look together was her gold headpiece worn over her updo, which truly made her look like an African queen.  In January, she (hilariously) presented the 2018 Oscar nominations with Andy Serkis, but all joking aside, she absolutely killed it in this look, while honoring her fellow Eritreans, she told ABC.

It’s badass,” one shopper wrote. “It’s thick, heavy, amazing, and high quality—freaking love it.” “Love the style of the jacket and it feels warm enough for an L.A. ‘winter,’” said another. “Very warm jacket—and nice-fitting,” explains a third reviewer. Oh, and did we mention J.O.A.’s faux-fur shearling jacket is pretty affordable? You can currently purchase it for as little as $65 depending on the color and style you choose. Now the only thing left to do is add one to your cart, throw it on, and shake up the Instagram algorithm with a selfie in this jacket. It’s only basic if you have the PSL in your hand.

Heidi Klum showed us all how to be a true Angel at one of the very first Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows. Wings not required.  At Paris Fashion Week in 2019, she reminded us of the style queen she is. Plus, I totally want bangs now.  Debra Shaw worked this gray off-the-shoulder suit at the John Galliano Runway more than 20 years ago.  Most recently, she slayed this leather jacket lewk at the Tommy Hilfiger X Zendaya runway show.  Amber Valletta walked in a sheer sheath with hot shorts underneath at the spring/summer 1995 Prada show.  In 2019 on the Versace runway, she absolutely killed it again in another amazing skin-baring style. Vanessa Paradis in this animal-print coat and heart-locket choker are what ’90s supermodel dreams are made of. In Paris for a Chanel show, Vanessa’s cool-girl blazer and classic red lip were super elegant. Janice Dickinson, aka one of the best judges on America’s Next Top Model, is an OG ’90s supermodel. Here she is strutting her stuff at a Kenzo show back in the day. On the red carpet for the American Icon Awards in 2019, Janice showed she’s still a true pro at this modeling thing.  At the spring/summer Prada show, Tatjana Patitz (one of the “Big Five” supermodels, BTW) sashayed in this windowpane-print short suit. And in 2019 in Milan, she worked a much more subdued look at the Etro show.  Carla Bruni strutted down the runway in a head-to-toe ’90s look of our dreams at Vivienne Westwood. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2019, she walked the red carpet in a sleek one-shoulder navy gown. Karen Mulder’s angel wings and babydoll were definitely representing the era well at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. At Paris Fashion Week in 2017, Karen Mulder sat front row at the Etam show. Shalom Harlow’s haute couture look at Christian Lacroix in 1995 serves to remind me that I will never try this red taffeta lion’s mane style, but it looks superb on her. In 2019, Shalom’s sultry walk and pose shut down the Versace show in Milan. Before Kaia Gerber was even a thing, Cindy Crawford was a legendary supermodel serving iconic looks like this Thierry Mugler sparkly romper. Cindy graced us all with her presence at a Chanel show in 2017, looking just as fashionable as ever.  Eva Herzigova was red-hot on the Chanel runway in 1992. In 2019, Eva toned it down to an all-black look for Max Mara. Beverley Peele was ready for vacay in this matching two-piece patterned suit at the Todd Oldham show. In 2018, Beverly walked the red carpet with her kids and showed us that her whole family is just as beautiful as she is.  Linda Evangelista at Chanel’s 1992 show is just another example of her managing to look good with literally any color or style of hair.  In 2015, she styled it in a more demure brunette color and donned this funky all-black ensemble. Kristen McMenamy’s strut on the Chanel 1991 runway is the edgy cool-girl vibe I’m personally hoping to achieve.  She looked super different in Khaleesi-level blonde locks at the fashion awards in 2018.

			 Sisters-in-law, style twins, or both?  After making a super cute appearance at Wimbledon with Meghan Markle yesterday, Kate Middleton attended the Men's Singles final at Wimbledon today with her husband Prince William. Unsurprisingly, she looked absolutely stunning wearing this yellow Dolce & Gabbana dress.  Even when she was slightly stressed about the actual tennis, she looked great. As always! The woman can do no wrong!  People were quick to point out that this is very similar to a style that Meghan wore just two weeks ago. Remember this beautiful Brandon Maxwell dress she wore to attend the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception on July 5?  She looked like an absolute ray of sunshine, even when Prince Harry was doing this funny pose.  But the dresses obviously aren't identical. Kate's has ruffled sleeves while Meghan's is cut longer. And while it may seem like Kate totally copied Meghan's style, this actually isn't the first time Kate's rocked yellow at a public appearance. She wore this yellow dress in Germany in 2017.  And she wore this coat while she was pregnant in 2013.  There was this shirt dress from 2012...  And this beautiful yellow number from 2011 that almost caused her to have a *very* bad wardrobe malfunction.  Basically, the bottom line is that both these women look absolutely amazing in yellow, which is a notoriously hard color to pull off. I mean, these two! What can't they do?!  Follow Emma on Instagram.

			 Wow, WOW, wow. I'm, like, literally realizing stuff, and that stuff is that Kylie Jenner looks hawt in her latest Instagrams, posted Wednesday.  In the series of pics, Kylie wears a form-fitting leopard-print maxi that has a totally '90s, low-cut cowl detail at the neckline. She's posing in some lawn, with a vine-covered building in the background, which also looks amazing!  In one of the photos, she's absolutely beaming, and she captioned it, "Happiness."  Another pic was a close up of the dress from the front, and the last one was a black and white shot from behind, despite the fact that in the image's caption, Kylie mentions, "I never post black and white photos.." Curious! Anyway, now I'm kind of into this leopard situation. Shop with me below! Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 They're! So! Cute!   OK, so hair accessories aren't anything new (Blair Waldorf circa 2007 is proof of that), and trends always rise and fall in popularity—but if one thing is for sure it's that clips, specifically barrettes, are back and way cooler than when you wore them for picture day in elementary school.  While this trend isn't breaking new ground (ever seen the 2001 classic The Royal Tenenbaums?) the difference is that now I feel like I can actually pull them off as a grown 24-year-old human. Why? It's officially filtered down from the Fall/Winter '18 runways straight to all the influencers and fashionistas on my Insta feed, and, wow, does it look cute. Case in point: Runway... 
 ...To IRL   〰 HEAVEN pins & more 〰 Link in bio Order by 1pm GMT Thursday for pre Xmas shipping🎅🏽 A post shared by  Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamslondon) on Dec 19, 2018 at 2:09am PST  this is a hair clip account now 🍯 A post shared by  alyssa coscarelli (@alyssainthecity) on Jan 4, 2019 at 7:55pm PST   LOVE MY TEAM @cgonzalezbeauty @teddicranfordhair @womenmanagementny #heatherhughes #versace94’ A post shared by  Behati Prinsloo Levine (@behatiprinsloo) on Oct 9, 2018 at 7:32am PDT  So if you're into nostalgic trends that channel your sometimes questionable but no doubt whimsical childhood fashion choices (*raises hand*), shop *all* the barrettes and clips below to bejewel your hair. Plus, with these embellishments on your head, you might not even need to wear any other accessory—they're that pretty.  
 The black-and-brown marbled style  is a classic pattern on barrettes and gives off a retro vibe. Also, because both hues are neutral, they'll complement any ensemble.  
 If you tend to think, "the more color the better," then you'll obsess over these bright clips. They come in sets featuring two shades or have multiple hues on the same barrette if you love yourself a bold look. If your first thought of pearls are the oversize earrings your mother wears, then these will totally change your mind. These modern clips add a sophisticated touch to any outfit without coming off as too overdone. Think of these as an updated version of the plastic bow-shaped accessories you put along your hairline as a kid. Whether its a ribbon clip or a metal piece, these barrettes are playful and oh-so cute.  If you really want your hair accessory to stand out from the rest, try one with a little sparkle or an interesting detail like a swinging chain. Clip in one of these babies and you'll get all the compliments—it's really that easy, folks.

			 Can't. Shop. Fast. Enough. Shopbop's extra 30 percent off sale starts today and only lasts until Thursday, December 13, so if you're behind on holiday shopping—or simply want to indulge yourself, like me—enter the code JOY18 at checkout. Here, 19 items included in the discount for your browsing pleasure. Scroll away!  Burgundy stripes transform a plain top into something not-so-basic.   You never knew you needed a mini half-moon necklace until now; wear this one with your other gold jewelry for a sophisticated situation.  Just because it's cold doesn't mean your hat game can't be fashionable. Enter: this topper featuring a rope band in both black and brown.  This accessory is made so much cooler with silver metal accents, extra zippers, and tassels.  Double your layers with this leather jacket that also has a built-in denim one underneath; plus, it's removable it if you want an all-black look.  A slightly sheer number is definitely sexy, but the textured appliques on the fabric and straps make it sweet—so it's basically perfect for any holiday parties coming up.  If you're over the tiny sunglasses trend but still want a pair with a slight cat-eye, snag these retro-looking sunnies that provide functional coverage for your eyes.  Crystal-drop earrings are practically made for a glam night out, and they'll add the final touch to any outfit.  Own too much denim? A camo option with a faux-fur collar will stand out from the others in your closet. Faux leather is the perfect transitional material—wear it on its own with sneakers in the fall, and, in colder temps, pair it with tights or over-the-knee boots.  A lightweight blouse with loose sleeves and a fitted silhouette pairs perfectly with jeans—you can dress it up with a knee-length skirt, too. Sure, leopard-print shoes are nothing new, but add a round, wooden heel to them and they'll instantly become the trendiest pair you own.  Finally! Something else you can wear with all your cozy, striped winter sweaters besides regular jeans.  If you have more than enough gold jewelry, opt for something more unique, like tortoiseshell.  You can wear the deep red hue well past the holiday season—plus, the lining will keep you oh-so-warm through the winter months. Have a bunch of holiday soirees coming up? An embroidered tiered dress with flutter sleeves is undeniably festive and great for dancing.  If you're a cropped pants aficionado, snag yourself an army-green twill pair with pleated details and buttons at the side.  Winter-fy your sneaker situation with some shearling shoes that'll receive ALL the compliments.  Functional for an overnight trip, a weekend getaway, or everyday use, this black option is lined and features multiple zippered compartments for extra storage.

Life gets hectic when you introduce a newborn. Get him these bite-size Bluetooth trackers, which can attach to pretty much anything, and he'll be able to find it in whatever mess he left it. (Added bonus: It will make your phone ring, even if you've left it on silent!)

			 Praise be!   Love using Rent the Runway but wish you could drop off your returns somewhere a little more chic than your local UPS? Say no more. On November 18 (today!), your fave retail store Nordstrom (I won’t tell the others, DW) announced a major partnership with the rental company. RTR will now have drop-off boxes at more than 29 Nordstrom locations to make the experience SO much more seamless and stress-free.   “We are thrilled to be expanding our partnership with Nordstrom, the company known and respected for their unparalleled commitment to deliver world-class service and experiences,” said Jenn Hyman, CEO and cofounder of Rent the Runway, in a press release. “As our business has grown, we’ve seen unparalleled demand for physical experiences including the convenience of drop-off boxes.” The rental company first tried this experience in the L.A. area and then decided to expand to other Nordstrom locations, FYI.  
  Another exciting thing that’s happening?! Both companies are collaborating in an even bigger way because now Nordstrom will be contributing inventory to RTR. Be prepared, because there are about to be waaay more rental options on the site, so you can score more designer and everyday pieces that’ll get you all the compliments.Oh, and because the announcements just keep on comin’, RTR members also now have access to Nordstrom’s styling and gift-wrapping services, so you won’t find yourself in a panic the day before holiday celebrations.

There are a ton of surprise deals and savings to be found, if you know where to look—and we’re on the Prime Day beat, so keep checking back throughout the sale for more updates! Before you know it, the temp is going to drop, and if your parka from last year feels lighter than you remember, you definitely need to check out the Orolay Thicken Down Jacket. You know, THE Amazon winter coat everyone was actually obsessed with last year? It has racked up more than 5,ooo reviews with an average 4.3 rating, making it the best-selling item in the Women’s Down Jackets & Parkas category. Oh, also: Did I mention it is on major sale for Prime Day? You’re welcome. Other super-warm winter coats can cost up to $200, but this puffer will keep you warm for just $140. It’s also windproof, water resistant, and machine washable (so long as you remove the faux fur). And for Amazon Prime Day, you can take 40 percent off this must-have winter item.

It’s a great jacket for the price that looks waaaaay more expensive than it is.” One thing reviewers did note is that the zipper tends to get stuck and can be a little awkward to zip, but it’s nothing that stopped them from raving about the coat’s coziness. If this coat seems like your jam, get on it. With Amazon’s two-day shipping, you could be living your warmest life by the weekend.

			 Being eco-friendly never looked so good! The textile industry is one of the world's biggest polluters—according to the EPA, Americans send 21 billion pounds of textile waste to landfills every year. How can you help? Seek out the brands that have the same concerns that you do. They might not have as many of the latest trends as, say, Forever 21, and they might not be as inexpensive, but that's part of the point! You'll be way more thoughtful about your purchases and subsequently, your impact on the environment.  So with that in mind, here are 21 sustainable fashion brands doing their part to treat Mother Earth with some much-needed respect.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Everlane's ReNew line features cute items made from recycled fabrics—and even water bottles! The brand even pledged to have no new plastic in its entire supply chain by 2021. Its new chunky "Tread" sneakers are made from old rubber and virtually free of new plastic too.  You keep hearing about Allbirds shoes, but with very good reason! Not only are they insanely comfortable, but they're made with sustainable materials like wool, trees, and even sugarcane—seriously.  Yes, you've probs heard of this brand before thanks to its bold, graphic patterns and stylish swimwear, but it also uses recycled, organic materials wherever possible. This marigold bikini, for instance, is made from 78 percent recycled nylon. The factories where garments are produced also follow strict guidelines so that workers are treated and compensated fairly.  Reformation sells everything from jeans to swimwear to bridal gowns. The brand makes sure you know exactly what went into making its effortlessly sexy pieces and how they compare to the rest of the industry. This brand's gorgeous dresses are made to order, generating less waste (there's no excess inventory to throw away, for instance). You also get your dress perfectly tailored to your body, which means you'll end up happier with the way it looks too. The athletic brand is working toward using more sustainable resources, and even has a whole section on its site with eco-conscious items. Most notably, its swimwear is made from recycled materials like nylon but is also quick-drying and has UPF protection. Yes, this cute geometric 'kini included!  At Amout Vert, you'll find wearable, breezy looks made with a mission to reduce waste at every part of the supply chain. It also plants a tree for every T-shirt it sells and makes items in limited quantities to cut down on excess materials.   This UK-based brand displays its ethos of sustainable and fair trade fashion right under its logo. People Tree is transparent about its sourcing, from its cotton to its wool, offers a wide variety of styles (just look at this chic tie-waist skirt!), and ensures its manufacturers and workers are treated ethically.  This California brand with a low-key, beachy aesthetic (think breezy T-shirts and tie-dye dresses) makes all of its clothing in Los Angeles and partners with different organizations and charities, including the ACLU and L.A. Family Housing.  Known for its trendy denim styles, DL1961 recycles water, uses clean indigo dyes, and uses energy-efficient fibers to make its pieces—all in a solar-powered facility, no less. So you'll feel that much better about wearing those stylish wide-leg cropped jeans.  All the producers involved in making Nisolo products, from its comfy slide shoes to its sleek tote bags and everything in between, are paid fair-trade wages, receive health care, and work in a healthy environment. The brand's accessories have a minimal aesthetic that go with basically any outfit.  Whether you're ready for a vacation or just love bright colors, this Brazilian company definitely has the perfect clothes for ya. But it also does its part to help the Earth by partnering with One Tree Planted, an organization dedicated to recovering endangered forest ecosystems. With every purchase, the brand plants one tree in the Amazon.  The iconic denim brand is working hard on improving its carbon footprint. One of its goals to achieve by 2025 includes a 40 percent carbon emissions reduction across its entire supply chain. It also saved more than 3 billion liters and recycled more than 2 billion liters of water when treating and finishing its denim pieces. Now that's a lotta H2O.  This L.A.-based brand makes jeans with sustainable fabrics and uses one-third of the amount of water needed for regular (aka bad for the environment) denim. It also recycles its fabric waste from cutting patterns to make new pieces. Even its hardware, like the buttons and rivets, are made from reused metal.  The brand has both cute and comfy options from lounge shorts and tank dresses and more importantly, ensures that everything is made in safe and clean conditions for its workers. It uses organic cotton, recycled water bottles, and less harsh dyes—its packaging is also biodegradable! Veja's retro sneakers are a favorite of celebrities (even Meghan Markle, the Duchess herself!), but they're also great for the environment. The materials, like organic cotton and even fish skin, used to make the shoes can be traced right down to where they were sourced. The brand also partners with Atelier Sans Frontières to employ those who have been incarcerated or who struggle to find jobs.  Yogis are obsessed with Manduka because of its durable yoga mats, which are free of chemicals and produced with zero emissions and made with recycled materials. The fabrics of its workout gear are also made using a combination of recycled polyester, plant-based fibers, and organic cotton.  Another fashion-forward brand based in Los Angeles, Etica uses natural dyes and softeners on its denim and says it uses 70 percent less chemicals than other companies.  In need of some new bras or loungewear? Kala is a loungewear and intimates with brightly-colored pieces you'll want to wear out of bed too. Its fabrics are come from certified eco-friendly suppliers, mills, and farmers, and the brand works exclusively with women-owned factories in New York. A bonus? Its packaging and shipping materials don't Use. Any. Plastic.  Uniqlo stores accept your used items from the brand, which are then recycled or given to refugees, the homeless, and others in need of clothing. As of August 2018, the brand has donated more than 30 million items to 65 countries and regions all over the world.  You love this brand for its Insta-friendly dresses and super-cute jeans, but it also partners with Fair Trade USA to ensure safe factory conditions, so its workers are empowered. Another cool thing? If you have an old pair of jeans you don't wear anymore, you can donate them at any store (they'll be turned into housing insulation?!) and get $20 off a brand-new spanking pair. Now that's a win-win.

			 White sneakers are basically a must.  Spring is almost here and I for one am so excited to finally wear shorts, dresses, and tank tops again. Need some cute but casual outfit inspo yourself? Here, 15 fashionable looks you'll want to wear 24/7.  A monotone staple like this ochre dress lets you have tons of fun with accessories, like a woven bag and cross strap sandals, for instance.  Looking to catch a warm breeze without your skirt flying up in public? Bike shorts have got you covered—literally. Complete the sporty look with dad sneakers and a cozy sweater if it's still cool outside (it's not summer yet, after all). You'll match the clear spring sky in a blue-and-white vintage tie-dye tee. Pair it with light-wash high-rise jeans and some low-heeled sandals for an effortlessly cool look, and then head to brunch at that sidewalk café you can finally eat at outside.  A baby blue puff sleeve top is light and airy with just enough coverage for transitioning temps. To complete the look, add in a picnic basket-esque straw bag and wide-leg jeans that'll allow you to comfortably sit criss-cross on a lawn—just remember to bring a blanket if you're wearing white.  Sometimes you really don't want to think too hard about your look, and that's what cable-knit sweaters were made for. Super stylish without the effort, they pair perfectly with your favorite flare jeans and some simple black pumps.  So you found your perfect color and you want to go all in?  Look no further than this skirt and jacket combo. Try a pastel or even a neon for a bold fashion statement. Opt for an understated basic white sneaker to keep the focus on your set.  Wear a collared shirt underneath a cozy knit sweater then pair it with a button-front skirt and slides for an outfit that's dressy on the top, and low-key on the bottom.  Put away the sweaters and sail into the sunset with this soft yellow jumpsuit, a bandeau bikini top, and black heeled sandals. Plus, it's super easy to slip off when you're ready to jump in the ocean! Nothing says you mean business like a button-up. If your office is the kind of place that's down with jeans, medium wash skinnies will keep the outfit sleek and casual. Finish off the look with a nude heel for extra sophistication.  Now that you don't have to bundle up just to step outside, grab this cute checkered miniskirt. Dress it down with a cropped sweatshirt and combat boots and you've got that "off-duty model" look.  Mom jeans have never looked so fashionable thanks to this super light-blue wash and slight cropped ankle. A sunshine yellow tank and trendy white sneakers will make you feel fresh.  If you have busy weekend plans go with a breezy wrap dress that's easy to throw on. Pull it together with a boho beaded bag and strappy slides.  It seems like everyone's wearing athleisure right now, and for good reason: It's the comfiest kind of outfit aside from literal pj's. Get your sleepwear streetwear on in a matching set like this pullover and sweats and pair it with some cute white sneaks. A strapless jumpsuit looks amazing with simple jewelry like a sweet pendant necklace and gold hoops. A crossbody bag completes this carefree weekend uniform.  Put an adult twist on denim overalls by adding a plain white tee and bright bandanna around your neck. Top it off with classic Chucks to accessorize without making the outfit seem overdone.

			 Some of these are so clever! Kensington Palace announced on Monday that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are expecting their first child. SO exciting, right??!!! Ah, congrats, you guys! Meghan is reportedly only about 12 weeks along in her pregnancy journey, and honestly, most people don't "show" a ton at this early of a stage. Nevertheless, eagle-eyed fans of the couple have spotted some diversion tactics she may have employed to throw us all off her tracks. Below, six tricks she may have used to keep the public off the scent:   Look, it's cold-ish outside in England right now, and it makes perfect sense that Meghan would be wearing coats a lot for this exact reason. BUT ALSO, jackets do a great job of hiding midsections and giving the illusion of a streamlined appearance—a.k.a. what bump?!       Blazers work in very much the same way as other jackets in terms of hiding a potential bump.   Goes without saying that a peplum detail that cuts away from the stomach will hide any bump someone isn't ready to share yet. Take the Oscar de la Renta one she wore on September 24, which featured voluminous frilling, for example.   When Meghan showed up to this event with straight hair, fan theories abounded about pregnancy, and not just because she was wearing that peplum shirt. Because she wore her hair straight and it was the first time she'd done so since getting engaged to Prince Harry. Apparently, changing up your hair right before you announce a pregnancy is a sweet diversion tactic Kate Middleton has used in the past—and, hey, it could be true in Meghan's case too!   Look, this is just a normal way to carry a clutch, but it's also very good placement if you want to hide a certain something from the prying eyes of cameras, so...       Much like peplum, well-placed ruffles and pleats can do a good job distracting the eye.   Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Bow down to the Met Gala Queen.  This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.   Rihanna is known for taking the Met Gala themes very literally — who could forget her walking floral sculpture look last year by Comme des Garçons or, perhaps even more iconic, her yellow Guo Pei gown? — and this year's "Heavenly Bodies" theme was no different. RiRi wore a freaking embellished papal tiara that matched with her strapless minidress and sparkly Christian Louboutin heels.  Of course, Rihanna always brings her A-game to the Met Gala, but this year, she's a co-chair of the event along with Amal Clooney and Donatella Versace, and wow, did she really deliver on the theme. I really want to know what Pope Francis thinks of this lewk, TBH, but I think he would give two-thumbs up.  More angles, because she looks truly HEAVENLY.  Petition to rename the Met Gala to National Rihanna Day.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 She's been spotted wearing this footwear brand SO. MANY. TIMES. Before Meghan Markle became the Duchess of Sussex and gained a sophisticated wardrobe filled with pale pink dresses and bateau necklines, she was your typical girl who accessorized with tote bags, and also wore ripped jeans and flats. See below:    When she appeared at the Invictus Games in September 2017 wearing frayed denim, a casual white button-down, a brown leather tote, and matching Sarah Flint ballet slip-ons, her style seemed not only approachable, but achievable, even when she was on the arm of a literal prince.  But even as her wardrobe changed, one thing that never did is her love of Sarah Flint footwear. Her pointed flats from that event were low-key and chic at the same time, but that wasn't the first time she was spotted in the label.   She's clearly been a fan of the brand since her Suits days: Case in point, in July 2016, she wore Sarah Flint's leopard heels with a navy pleated shirt dress and a black tote leaving a taping of the Today Show in New York City.  She accessorized with them again four months earlier – at the same location – wearing a similar blue outfit, that featured a pencil skirt, turtleneck, wrap coat, and a bright red purse.    After her engagement to Prince Harry in November 2017, she opted for Sarah Flint pumps at more formal events too, such as the ANZAC Day Dawn Service, commemorating Australian and New Zealand casualties and veterans of conflicts, which she observed in April 2018.  On that day, she wore the brand's suede pumps with a tortoiseshell heel along with a grey peacoat, a black hat, and a red poppy.     Even when traveling with Queen Elizabeth, it's her go-to label. She wore these Sarah Flint leather pumps with her neutral, belted Givenchy dress in June.    You really can't beat a classic stiletto, and this pair even has extra padding to cushion your feet, as well as arch support. It's no wonder Meghan chose them for this all-day outing, which required a LOT of walking and standing.  She wore other Sarah Flint shoes in that same month, including a pair of leather sandals with canvas straps at the ankle, to watch husband Prince Harry play polo at the Audi Polo Cup in Berkshire, U.K.    Meghan donned a much more casual outfit with the shoes: a gingham shirt dress and a straw hat from Madewell – a huge difference from her dressier ensembles of late.  It's safe to say we'll be seeing more of Meghan in this brand. A plus? As far as royal wardrobes go, it's relatively affordable. Buy a pair for yourself and you can walk a mile – probably more, TBH – in an actual duchess' shoes.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			  You’re gonna look so fab!  It’s (almost) the most wonderful time of the year! Yes, the holidays are coming up fast and Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year’s Eve, and whatever else you celebrate are all in the span of, like, one month. If you’re already stressing over what to wear to all the parties happening, then you’ve come to the right place—there’s no such thing as planning too far ahead! Dressing in festive attire without looking cheesy and while also staying warm is a challenge, so we’ve rounded up 16 chic holiday outfit ideas you’ll love to wear for any type of soirée. Whether you’re trying to dress to impress at the office holiday party or look effortless at a friend’s get-together, look no further than these pretty ’fits.  Attending a fancier holiday occasion? A tulle dress with a gorgeous starry print will make you feel confident for the night ahead. Pair it with platform heels for extra comfort, and throw on a winter white faux-fur coat to stay warm.  Jumpsuits are a great evening alternative if you’re not quite feelin’ a dress. A bright red one is v festive for a holiday party without being too on the nose.   A sequin top with statement sleeves, a maxi pencil skirt, and strappy sandals looks surprisingly effortless, which is perfect for really any holiday party. You can always add some red or sparkly heels for a little more oomph.  Get ready for a night out with a pearl-embellished green velvet dress. If you’re meeting friends for cocktails at an upscale joint, this is for you! A tiny shoulder bag and two-strap pumps complete the look.  Who else refuses to wear color in the winter? A sleek black leather jumpsuit is definitely bold and you can pull the whole thing together with a PVC pump. Easy, right?  Pleats, please! You can’t go wrong with a maxi gold skirt for your office holiday party. Pair it with a luxe cashmere turtleneck, fishnet stockings, and your favorite pair of classic black heels.  A lace blouse with a matching bralette underneath is subtly sexy, especially with a pair of leather pants. This outfit is perfect for holiday drinks with friends—or that person you’ve been crushin’ on. Complete the look with a classic white pump.  Nothing says “It’s Christmas!!!” like a chic red sequin dress. Edge it up with some black block heel booties.  Not all holiday parties are super fancy, and that’s okay! Whether your friend is hosting a low-key get together or the dress code is more casual, a leopard-print coat over a black turtleneck and leather pants is something stylish that’s easy to throw on. Accessorize with a pair of black ankle boots, and you’re good to go!  A silver mini lamé dress is a SHOWSTOPPER. Add a pair of sky-high heels and a fringed evening clutch, and you’re basically walking tinsel (in the best way possible).  A sweater dress combined with tall snakeskin booties is dressy enough for a holiday party, yet casual enough to grab hot cocoa with your friends. Top it off with a shearling-trimmed coat and you’ll be oh-so cozy in cold temps.  A blazer dress in winter white is undeniably sophisticated. Peep the gold buttons and flared sleeves! Coordinate the look with shimmery lurex tights for extra warmth and a matching high heel.  Velvet floral details and a flutter sleeve add some romantic details to an otherwise simple black maxi. Wear this dress with a black satin evening coat, and you’ll get so many compliments.  A green velvet number will get you noticed at any event. The wrap silhouette combined with statement earrings and black pumps make it classic. The only thing that’s missing is a cocktail in hand, duh.  This sweater is so unique with its pearl embellishment on the zipper. It looks fashionable with a belted skirt, and you’ll be extra comfortable in lace-up block-heeled boots.  A fringed sequin dress is definitely flirty. Add a pair of statement earrings (and maybe twirl around to some holiday jams), and you’ll be turning heads.

			 Why is the high-fashion life so hard? Alright, here's the deal: Bell-sleeves can be really pretty. I wore a top with them the other week that got me tons of compliments—that felt nice! But with the style so prevalent nowadays—like, you really can't go to a store online or in person without seeing at least five of the designs—you'd think more people would be talking about what an absolute nightmare it is to do basically any daily task while wearing it. (BTW, the sweater I wore is on the right >>>) Scroll on down for a list of all the things that I straight up could NOT do the day I wore bell sleeves. 
  1. Brush my effing teeth. Wow, let me tell you, the day was a struggle practically the moment I stepped out of bed. While tending to my pearly whites, I held back my hair with one hand, as I normally do while I brush, then quickly realized my unwieldy sleeves were in the danger zone of accidental spit-drippage at nearly every angle I tried. Letting go of my hair and grabbing onto a sleeve only helped a little bit, since there was still a bell on the loose—plus, now my hair was also in the danger zone.  2. Style my hair. This, at least, didn't bear the threat of foamy toothpaste, but rest assured it was still super annoying. My sleeves hit me in the face at least seven times while I ran my brush through my hair. I felt defeated, and it was only 8am. 3. Go to the bathroom. Gotta level with you—using the restroom with these things on is just deflating. I won't get into it, but you have to kinda hold both sleeves with one hand to see what's going on—it's all very humiliating. I'm going to move on now because I don't really want to dwell here. 4. Wash my hands. You can't hold back the sleeves with your hands while you wash them, because they're obviously the focus of the task. I awkwardly had to pin mine back at my sides with my elbows, looking like some kind of fashion-conscious T-Rex, and hunch over the sink to get a good lather. Every. Time.  5. Type on the computer. Even if you let the bottom half of your bell sleeves droop below your desk, the top halves are still free to spread willy-nilly across your keyboard, hiding letters from you and causing you to hit unintentional keys from time to time. As a writer whose, like, whole thing is typing on them QWERTYS—that's annoying. 6. Get my hands into a coat. OK, we've arrived. This is my biggest beef with these damn sleeves. Everyone knows the struggle of getting into a jacket with a chunky sweater: clamping the bottom of the sleeve between your palm and fingers as you slide the whole thing through, or, forgetting to do that and ending up with a huge lump somewhere near your elbow that just sits there uncomfortably until you're willing to admit your mistake and try again.  IT'S WAY WORSE WITH BELL SLEEVES. That's because the whole clamping method only works for one side of the sleeve. The rest is bunched up by your elbow and even up by your armpit unless you jam your other hand into the coat and patiently stretch the rest of the thing down where it belongs. This, truly, is what Hell must be like.  7. Eat. When will it end? Eating was a horror show. If I wasn't dragging a sleeve through my sandwich and knocking off the top piece of bread, I was just intermixing the sleeves with the crumbs on the table. 8. Make any subtle gesture. Anything you do with your hands all day long while wearing bell sleeves automatically becomes 1,000 times more dramatic. That's because you're basically  wearing capes on your forearms, and there's only so much you can do while emphasizing any point to tone down the flourish and movement that comes naturally to them. 9. Stay warm. The one thing sleeves do, historically, is cover you up so you're nice and toasty. These sleeves? Notsomuch. Unless you're the kind of person who never uses their hands and keeps their arms directly down at their sides at all times, then you're really only wearing a three-quarter length sleeve. From your elbow on down, you're totally exposed. So, these sleeves aren't even really sleeves—they're liars! In conclusion: Do I hate bell sleeves? Nah. I still think they're super cute and fun-looking and can certainly add drama to your outfit. But if I'm ever going to wear them again, it's gotta be worth going through Hell. Here are some bell-sleeve pieces I'll actually consider wearing in the future: Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Whoa: There's much more to their clothing choices than meets the eye. We all know a hugely important aspect of Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle's royal roles is to look effing amazing while representing The Crown out and about in the modern world. But if you think they throw on any old outfit that looks good, then wow, are you wrong.  Not only do they have to consider whether the colors, textures, and patterns they wear could honor or—eek!—offend whoever they're meeting on official royal business, they also have to think about whether those choices are on par with their Personal Brands.  So what do Kate's and Meghan's outfits actually say about who they are? Turns out, quite a lot. With the help of Dr. Anna Akbari, author and former professor at NYU and Parsons, who specializes in the sociology of style and self-presentation, Cosmopolitan.com decoded the secret messages the fashionable royals may be sending with their ensembles. Scroll on to get to know the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex—or, as I like to call 'em, Kate and Meg—on a whole new level. "Meghan's every style choice is under the microscope right now, and I think she knows that by making more conformist choices that are in line with traditional royal protocol, it will earn her greater internal clout," Dr. Akbari says. "The research I've done on how individuals self-present in somewhat homogenous situations, be it corporate environments or whatever, is that if you already stand out—which certainly Meghan does as an American coming from Hollywood—you aren't looking to accentuate your differences as you try to be effective in your setting." Dr. Akbari adds that those in this situation are typically the best-dressed people in the room (ahem, Meg's got that on lock), because they feel like they don't have leeway, and they're not looking to draw more attention to themselves. "That seems to be Meghan's approach as she assimilates into the royal family. Wearing more dresses and skirt-sets, putting on the pantyhose—we really see her embracing a lot of these traditional markers of royal style."   According to Dr. Akbari, Kate Middleton's post-proposal and early marriage style indicated that she felt comfortable in her new surroundings. The navy dress by Issa that she wore for her November 2010 engagement announcement, for example, signaled that—blue is a traditional regal color, and the design itself was pretty sexy, with its fitted top and lower neckline.  The same could be said for her wedding dress. Though it could be called old-fashioned—her dress was a near-replica of Grace Kelly's 1956 gown—Kate's Alexander McQueen piece came off as young and sexy. Its fitted bodice, see-through elements, and plunging neckline help. Dr. Akbari thinks this choice represented her totally chill attitude going into her new job.  Meghan's November 2017 engagement announcement ensemble, while super sleek and fashionable, was a bit covered up and conservative. In case you forgot, she wore a white Line the Label coat closed over a green Parosh dress and neutral Aquazurra pumps. "Prior to her engagement, we saw more of a Hollywood-chic aesthetic—artfully distressed with an eye on trends. This is a moment where we see a shift into royal formality. She knows there will be different expectations now that she's entered the family, and that transition is reflected in her style choices."   Her wedding dress had the same vibe. Meghan's more understated, conservative Givenchy gown, with its higher '50s-era bateau-neckline and opaque fabric, could have been trying to "demonstrate that she can take this new role seriously," according to Dr. Akbari.   Kate is probably always going to appear as the preppy, super colorful royal, wearing full skirts, cheery patterns, and coat dresses to formal engagements, and looking like she stepped out of a Ralph Lauren ad at casual appearances.  She opted for this kind of aesthetic early on, as it is pretty timeless and hard to critique, says Dr. Akbari. "She's mastered that look, and it suits her. Imagining Meghan Markle in the same style would feel forced—she's never been preppy, so it would be weird to see her fully embracing that." Additionally, Dr. Akbari says her tendency to recycle outfits "sends a message that she's real" and relateable.  Meghan had to go in a different direction for her royal style, coming into the family with an already-established and well-documented trendy vibe. The look she goes for nowadays—a tendency to wear elevated, monochromatic separates, more pantsuits, and sleeker silhouettes, even when she's casual—is, for the most part, one we'd never see Kate undertake.  "[The public doesn't] associate those trends with Kate, but they're still timeless," Dr. Akbari says. "With these choices, she seems to be saying, 'Maybe I can't bring my Hollywood hip style to Buckingham Palace, but that doesn't mean that I need to conform completely to my counterpart Kate.'" Kate has already established who she is on the world stage with her style, according to Dr. Akbari. While we may see subtle changes in the coming years, we know, for the most part, what to expect from her, and it's predictable. "That's not a critique, by the way, and she shouldn't change that—it really works for her," says Dr. Akbari. Conversely, Meghan's aesthetic is expected to change over time—because she likes to play with fashion. "We don't know yet where the arc of Meghan's style trajectory will go," says Dr. Akbari. "My hunch is that eventually—I don't know if it will be this year or in the next few years—she'll find a way to continue to adhere to royal protocol while also infusing it even more with her own personal look and preference." Apparently, this is called "distinguished compliance," which is basically just a fancy term that means she has to, and wants to, demonstrate both to the royal family and the world that she "gets it" before she can truly experiment more with super edgy or trendy garments.     We've already seen her do that a little bit (when she's worn textures like leather and more bold silhouettes, like her pantsuits), and we'll most likely see more of it as she starts to feel less like an outsider and more like herself—albeit in princess form.

			 I don't even know. There's not much to say here other than Fashion Nova is selling these lace-up jeans. They cost $49.99 and I both hate them and love them and if I see you wearing them on the streets, I'll laugh and also bow down. DO IT! Let's get a good look at the good: Fashion! Get into it! Now buy these and then call me so we can walk down the street together and turn some heads. I'll bring the popcorn!

			 Everyone will ask you, “OMG, where did you get that?!” Everyone has different tastes in jewelry—some are gold people, others are silver; some love sparkle, while others love simple—but one thing we can probably all agree on is that it definitely completes any outfit. Here, 26 need-to-know jewelry brands that offer every kind of look, whether it’s a mismatched set of earrings, a classic pendant necklace, a straight-up bold pair of hoops, or everything in between.  Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! The London-based brand offers tons of gorgeous designs with colorful gemstones and gold vermeil, so you can find jewelry that fits the exact aesthetic you're going for. Founder Marisa Hordern sources stones and crystals from all over the world including Thailand, India, and Hong Kong, and the brand's newest Momposina collection (which includes these stunning hoops) was inspired by her travels to Colombia.  Twenty-nine-year-old designer Amanda Thomas got her jewelry line into stores when she was just 16. You’ve probably seen Kendall Jenner or Bella Hadid sporting her edgy gold designs, and great news! They’re also very much affordable. This chunky pinkie ring with crystal accents is one of the brand’s best-sellers. This label is inspired by that sunny Los Angeles weather and features gold styles, like these drop earrings, as well as resin, embellished, and crystal designs that definitely make a statement. Founder Kendra Scott designed her first line in 2002, and since then, her namesake label has become instantly recognizable. Her pendant jewelry, such as this bar necklace, is arguably her most popular style, and you’ll have a plethora of colorful options to choose from. This brand’s designs are super fashion-forward, especially when it comes to what’s trending on Instagram. Shashi has no shortage of delicate necklaces, rings, and earrings, all at accessible price points. Gorjana Reidel and her husband, Jason Griffin Reidel, founded the brand in 2004, and opened their first brick-and-mortar store in 2016. Now, you can find their timeless designs at countless retailers. Gorjana’s pieces often include semiprecious stones, like this turquoise pendant, that add a subtle pop of color to any outfit. Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods were both spotted wearing earrings from the label on their vacation to Mexico earlier this year, and other celebs known to sport the brand include Hailey Bieber, Bella Hadid, and Rita Ora. Basically, if you’re looking for on-trend designs but still want to save money, it’s worth looking into. If you’re a fan of colorful enamel or pavé jewelry, then Kate Spade is perfect for you. The brand’s whimsical accessories often feature hearts, animals, flowers, cute sayings, and, of course, its signature spade logo. If you like matching your accessories to fit your vibe, hit up BaubleBar. The brand has tons of vibrant options featuring crystal embellishments, nautical shells, boho hoops, bold beaded pieces, and more. In short, basically everyone can find that standout piece they’ve been looking for here. Known for its trendy Instagrammable “ark” bags and beachy clothing, Cult Gaia’s acrylic hoop earrings have gained almost as much popularity. They come in a bunch of  hues and make the ultimate summer accessory. This Vancouver-based label is run by women, and the pieces are made using recycled sterling silver or bronze. If you’re looking for dainty jewelry with a bit of edge, its cool chain-link designs definitely hit the mark. The New York City–based brand offers a variety of earrings, including studs, “suspenders,” huggies, and hoops, but it also has playful charm necklaces, statement rings, and delicate bracelets. Because Mejuri is a direct-to-consumer label (i.e., it cuts out third-party retailers), it’s able to offer designs with 14-karat gold, ethically sourced diamonds, gemstones, and pearls at way lower costs than usual. Everything is so dang gorgeous (I mean, just look at this vintage-inspired medallion!) and is made for layering and stacking. If you’re obsessed with bold hues, then Roxanne’s jewelry is so up your alley. Her cheerful, almost childlike aesthetic is why she’s gained such a cult following in the fashion sphere. She’s known for her stunning asymmetrical crystal earrings (seen here) as well as her beaded jewelry reminiscent of the accessories you probably made at summer camp. Tiffany’s needs no introduction, but in case you need one, the brand has been around since 1837(!!!), and stars from Audrey Hepburn to Lady Gaga have worn its jewelry. Its most iconic designs include the tag charms (this one also has a zodiac sign on it if astrology’s your thing!) with that signature “Tiffany blue” shade. This direct-to-consumer brand is all about stacking on the bling. If you have multiple piercings, the sparkly earrings are perfect for piling on. Plus, they’re sold as singles, which is ideal for mixing and matching. It also offers equally eye-catching necklaces, rings, bracelets, and even anklets. Another fine jewelry brand without the crazy markups is Stone and Strand, which is based out of New York City. Your ensemble won’t feel complete without wearing its super-dainty pieces—they’ll seriously get you all the compliments. Love yourself some shimmery crystals? Then obviously, Swarovski is the place for you. The brand has been around since the 1800s and has some extremely gorgeous necklaces and earrings, including this crescent moon style. Chan’s childhood growing up on the beaches of Vietnam greatly influenced her jewelry aesthetic. Many of her designs look like you could’ve picked them up right from the ocean, including these stunning pearl earrings. Maria creates all the jewelry for her namesake label in her Copenhagen-based studio. She’s known for her uniquely shaped designs that feature spirals and curves, as seen on this pearl ring, but they also have a minimalist look. Founded by a mother (Brinker) and daughter (Eliza) duo, the brand’s inspiration comes from their time collecting sea glass on the beach and skiing in the winter. Many styles include pearls, shells, beads, and vibrant stones if you’re looking for a go-to piece of jewelry this summer. The Brooklyn-based brand has quite the following—even Meghan Markle has worn one of its rings—thanks to its teeny-tiny earrings and super-thin-chained chokers. I mean, go into the label’s storefront in Williamsburg on any given weekend, and you can see just how popular it is. Designer Alison Chemla is known for her fine jewelry, but when she launched her “LOUCITE” diffusion collection last year, they quickly went viral. These lucite “jelly hoops” were seen on Emily Ratajkowski, Selena Gomez, and so many other celebs, and they come in multiple bright shades and sizes. Founders Joyce Binneboese and Dana Roski were inspired by those trinkets you keep from your travels and launched their Berlin-based jewelry brand in 2018. The designs were quickly seen all over Instagram and are perfect for the warm weather ahead. If you have eclectic taste, Timeless Pearly is right there with ya. Its asymmetrical earrings, like the ones seen here, and colorful necklaces are made to be stacked, mixed, and matched for a maximalist vibe. Another of Meghan Markle’s favorites is this brand. In 2001, Los Angeles–based Reyter launched her line, which features beautiful diamond jewelry with a geometric flair, like this angled pendant.

			 She would've FREAKED (in a good way).  I owned a LOT of choker necklaces growing up—like the stretchy black kind you bought at Claire's for $2—but none were as prized as my puka-shell necklace. It had plastic turquoise beads and was held together by rope. I wore it so often in the fourth and fifth grades that it finally tore one day but I couldn't bring myself to let it go. It stayed, in its sadly out-of-commission condition, in my jewelry box for two more years before I finally threw it away.  
 Finally, in the eighth grade, I bought a new shell necklace—this time attached to a leather cord so it wouldn't wear out—and I still have it today. I wore it to work one day last year, only to have a co-worker poke fun at me and ask, incredulously, "Is that seriously a puka shell?"  Contrary to what my co-worker implied (excuse you, Sarah-Louise!), I'm here to tell you it's not a passing fad your middle-school self would pair with Hollister tops and flip flops. Shell jewelry is better than ever and ready for you to embrace again.  Today's beachy necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, with their gold accents and effortless vibe, have a grown-up look to them that's anything but kitschy. I wish I could tell my middle-school self that more than a decade later shells, specifically puka and coffee bean trivia, would be all over your go-to shopping websites.  Established designers like Isabel Marant and Rebecca de Ravenel have been making the case for shell jewelry, and indie brands like WALD Berlin, Gimaguas, and Brinker & Eliza all have dreamy accessories too.  I gravitate toward an aesthetic that could be called "perpetually vacationing at a seaside resort," so personally, I am here for this revival. But you, too, can get in on the style—whether you're on a summer vacation or not—by shopping more pieces below.  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Hello, stocking stuffers for your whole family.  This Black Friday, Adidas fans are in luck. On Amazon, some of the brand's bestselling products are up to 40 percent off, so now is the best time to stock up on workout clothes, athleisure, and accessories if you want to spend the next year rocking the trefoil.  For some reason, buying Adidas products on Amazon is generally cheaper than shopping in-store, and on Black Friday, the prices are even lower. Though different colors and sizes change the price slightly, these products are sure to be a hit no matter who you're buying them for.  The Adidas logo on this drapey muscle tank has a pearlized finish, so the color shifts with every stride. It also hangs long in the back, giving you extra coverage. These lightweight running shoes come in classic colors like beige, navy, and black, plus yummy pastels like coral and baby blue. The CloudFoam memory liner molds to your feet for a cushioned run. (The beige ones are also basically half price.) This classic shoe is a staple in any guy's closet, and a great gift for a brother who didn't tell you what to buy him this year. They're made for skating, but non-skaters also love them because they're durable, versatile, and just polished enough to wear to work. Who doesn’t love a sporty, pompom beanie? This is an easy one for that hard-to-gift person on your list. The adidas logo is intarsia-knit into the side of the acrylic hat, capped with a bicolor pompom. This mini backpack is great for packing for an afternoon hike—it's big enough to fit a water bottle, snack, keys, and wallet, but probably not big enough for a laptop or sneakers. These sneakers are Adidas' classic Continental style, sized down for the kiddos. With white leather and a subtle black and red stripe, they'll go with everything.

			 Because she won't be a regular mom. You'll have as much fun shopping for these adorable items as she'll have receiving them. Here, 21 baby shower gift ideas she'll totally love.  A waterproof backpack that has extra storage pockets and insulated lining is a must, but it's even better in a trendy shade of pink.  A baby monitor will give her piece of mind, and this one not only records video and audio, but it also provides two-way wireless talk, functions as a night light, plays lullabies, and more.  Her baby will be comfortably swaddled in adjustable blankets featuring cute pink and black patterns.  Pregnancy can involve many sleepless nights for some future moms, so she'll appreciate a fancy five-piece set that will make tired-looking skin glow.  If you can't decide between a fuzzy animal or a blanket, get her this organic cotton gift that combines both.  If she's had her fair share of swollen feet, but is tired of wearing sneakers, a pair of comfortable low-heeled pumps in pastel blue might be right up her alley.  Gold chain earrings are the perfect gift for a trendy mom-to-be that she can wear with almost every outfit.  A wool jacket with easy snap fastenings will ensure her newborn is cozy in cold weather, but the wrap silhouette will make them look like the coolest baby on the block.  When her little one gets fussy, she'll be so thankful for a soft organic cotton lounger designed to wrap around a newborn's body and relax them.  Treat a mom-to-be with a fuzzy fleece robe that'll make her mornings and evenings that much more cozy.  Both mom and baby will enjoy a soothing rosebud and peony fragrance that fills any room.  Her baby's feet will be protected and kept warm with a set of fun animal socks in stripes and polka dots.  She'll have the title of "mom" very soon, so get her a delicate gold necklace she'll want to wear ASAP.  There's nothing like a memory book to keep track of all the exciting events and milestones that happen in a baby's life, and it's a great way to look back on old photos.  Does she already have more than enough gifts for her newborn? Treat her with a chic purse that makes her feel sophisticated.  Her baby will be the cutest in a pair of yellow striped pants. Also, this pair is made from organic cotton-jersey that feels amazingly soft on skin.  An organizational caddy with multiple pockets will look at home in any nursery; plus, the inserts are removable for functional storage.  If you know she's on her feet a lot, she'll definitely appreciate a pair of cashmere ballet slippers with a durable microfiber sole.  Add a timeless piece to her jewelry collection with a simple gold ring featuring crystal accents.   For all those restless nights she might have after her baby is born, a sleep mask will totally come in handy.  Whether she calls a baby sitter for a romantic evening evening out or she just wants to feel put together, she'll love a trio of matte lipsticks in the prettiest tones of pink and red.

			 Look fab, stay warm, and get sh*t done in these. The cold months are already here, and soon winter will be upon us in full force. If you ever get in a style rut as soon as it’s freezing outside or find yourself wearing the same ol’ black sweater over and over to the office each week (*raises hand*), it’s gonna be okay. We’ve rounded up some cute ’n’ cozy work outfits that’ll snap you out of it. Whether you work 9 to 5 in a business-casual office, in a creative field, or in a more corporate setting, we’ve got some stylish winter outfit inspiration just for you. Here, 17 cute winter work outfits that’ll not only keep you toasty warm at your desk, but also impress your coworkers and bosses with your fashion sense.  Lean into neutrals this season with a cream-colored fuzzy jacket and animal-print skinnies. Keep it polished with some pointed black slides, and you’ll be so comfy at your desk.  If it’s more of a corporate atmosphere, you’ll look pulled together at the office in a coordinating blazer and pant. Style it with an elevated mule and keep it simple with clean white tee underneath.  Try a cardigan midi dress with some knee-high boots to keep you warm in the office.  These plaid pants are easy to style with simple black knit sweater. Add a fun zip bootie and a trendy faux-fur-trimmed structured bag to make it more *fashun.*  A pleated dress with ballon sleeves definitely makes a statement in the hallways, but it still looks v polished—especially with a pair of metallic heels. (If it’s too cold outside, you can always keep them under your desk and swap your sneakers for them once you get in.) A faux-fur coat against a beige turtleneck and styled with your favorite denim and cream booties is the ultimate causal Friday outfit. It’s also cute enough to wear to those dinner plans with your friends after.  Try a fashion-forward puff-sleeve turtleneck and pair it with a check print skirt for those cold-weather vibes. Add slouchy boots and a chain-strap bag to keep it stylish.  Keep it simple with a black, utilitarian dress and add color with a high-shine red bootie; plus, this design makes it great for layering long sleeves under it.  If your job requires you to dress up then this is the look for you. A belted silk maxi dress is great to layer under a coat in the winter time and it happens to look killer with a tall black boot.  Each time winter comes back around, faux-leather pants appear everywhere. Wear this cold-weather staple to the office with a classic block-heel pump and add a bold red sweater to prevent any chills.  This striped cardigan is made for layering. Balance out the ensemble with an elevated silk navy skirt and more low-key white sneakers.  If your office doesn’t really have a dress code, keep it casual in a matching jacket and pants with white sneaks. Add a striped long-sleeve to break up the solid colors, and bam! Your work outfit looks so effortless.  Keep it profesh in a polished shirtdress with a belted waist and complete the look with some not-too-high black heels. Now you’re ready to crush it in that meeting, girl.  This jacket is the real deal for warmth in the winter. Style the puffer with a chic midi dress for more coverage and add a thick-soled sneaker to keep the look modern and extremely comfy. Go monotone in a gorgeous olive-green hue. (It makes getting dressed in the morning SO much easier when you pick one color, just sayin’.) Pair the outerwear with a cashmere sweater and a wide-leg trouser to complete the ensemble.   This shearling coat is sure to keep you warm while commuting. Style it with a trans-seasonal bohemian midi dress and add a warm winter hiking boot.  Stay warm in the office with an oversize sweater over a striped silk skirt. Coordinate it with a comfy kitten heel if you know you’re gonna be on your feet a lot.

			 And the brand is gaining new fans with its inclusive imagery. Inclusive clothing company Universal Standard announced on Instagram on Monday that it will soon launch a new basics line called Foundation, which will carry sizes 00 through 40—and the image it used to make that announcement is making waves. The post featured activist and model La'Shaunae Steward unapologetically posing in a white tank-top, socks, and underwear, as she should. Take a look:  ALL OF US. AS WE ARE. FOUNDATION. SIZES 00-40 COMING SOON A post shared by  Universal Standard (@universalstandard) on Oct 8, 2018 at 5:59am PDT Commenters from all over have flocked to the post to praise the brand, whether they were already fans or not, writing things like, "I love this, I never heard of this brand until today but I'm about to f*cking buy EVERYTHING because REPRESENTATION MATTERS. Thank you so much for showing and making garments for all types of bodies!" and "Everyone deserves well-made, well-fitting clothes no matter their size. Everyone deserves to feel beautiful in beautiful clothing. Thank you!" According to La'Shaunae, the photo inspired her to think differently about her own body:   shot by ronan A post shared by  la'shaunae (@luhshawnay) on Oct 8, 2018 at 8:07am PDT  Well said.

			 Shonda Rhimes said the effort "was launched on the red carpet, but was never intended to live there." Organizers of the Times Up movement, including Shonda Rhimes, Laura Dern, director Ava DuVernay, and producer Katie McGrath, confirmed in a press conference on Thursday that there will be no dress code at Sunday night's Oscars ceremony. Rhimes said the initiative “was launched on the red carpet but was never intended to live there."  Times Up has gained a lot of momentum over the past couple of months. In January, actors and actresses wore black to the Golden Globe Awards — Hollywood's first major awards show since the allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Harvey Weinstein. (Weinstein has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.) Celebs then wore black to the BAFTAs in February to stand in solidarity with survivors and women's rights. They also wore white roses to the Grammys and to the BRIT Awards in support of the movement.  The movement, which officially launched January 1, has already amassed more than $21 million in a legal-defense fund to support "women and men who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace and while in pursuit of their careers."  There has been speculation about how the topic will be broached at the Oscars, and in an interview with Good Morning America, Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel said the show is "not about reliving people’s sexual assaults.” He later confirmed to Vanity Fair that he will speak about the #MeToo movement in his monologue.

			 She's not here for the hate.  Iggy Azalea is responding to criticism over her recent Fashion Nova campaign. The rapper took to Twitter to voice her opinions about the controversy by saying it gives her something to focus on creatively.  "Say what you want about me posting pictures on instagram but honestly, it gives me something else creative i can focus on - when sometimes im in a dark place or i feel stagnant. Most days i want my project to drop, yesterday! but i dont get to make those choices."  "and maybe its silly, but it really has been helping me lately to feel more postive and just keep my mind in a creative space constantly thinking of new visual things and color palates. Im really glad ive got something i can do without needing permission." Last week, Iggy posted two photos for the campaign, and was immediately met with flack about how she posted photos more than she released songs.  Iggy is nude in both photos that she posted on Instagram—with the exception of a pair of strappy stilettos in both nude and black.  "Sometimes all you need is a good pair of heels @fashionnova," captioned the rapper on the post where she donned nude heels.  Iggy is advertising the company's slinky shoes, and the Fashion Nova Instagram account also posted the same two photos of Iggy wearing their Take It Back Heel, which you can buy here. Iggy is the latest celeb to endorse Fashion Nova, as the affordable brand is famously beloved by Cardi B, Amber Rose, Kylie Jenner, and more.

			 How is she always so chic??!?! Meghan Markle was spotted on Monday wearing the trendy winter white ensemble of your dreams: A cream-colored coat by Amanda Wakeley, navy Manolo Blahnik pumps, a Mulberry bag, and an amazingly chic white beret by Stephen Jones. She attended a service to mark Commonwealth Day at Westminster Abbey alongside Prince Harry (who was doing that weird thing with his hands again), Prince William, and Kate Middleton. A bonafide family outing! Designer Stephen Jones has created many hats for the royal family — mostly fascinators and wide-brimmed hats, like Kate's navy accessory above — but this beret is a true standout.  Markle is not the only celeb trying out the French-inspired look. Bella Hadid, Cara Delevingne, and Kendall Jenner have been spotted recently wearing the trend. Make no mistake: Berets are definitely in.  Look! Berets also pair well with adorable children and flowers!  Très chic, non?  You may now carry on with your day knowing that Meghan Markle is definitely a hat person, and we feel confident that this won't be her last boundary-pushing headpiece.

			 Sometimes the wind is just NOT your friend.  Celebrities can only be so prepared (double-sided sticky tape, static guard, etc.) when it comes to wardrobe malfunctions—which is why there have been...a lot of them. Stars have suffered from every crazy incident possible, from dresses flying up on the red carpet to clasps simply coming loose at the exact wrong moment. Ahead, the 50 most NSFW wardrobe mishaps we’ve seen so far. The A-lister and Goop mastermind wore a chic satin blazer to the VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards, but she had a near nip slip when she turned sideways to walk the red carpet. Sarah Jessica Parker had a major Marilyn Monroe moment while shooting Sex and the City in New York. (Luckily, she was wearing cute underwear.) Anne Hathaway’s nipples were clearly visible through the dress she wore to the premiere of School of Rock. Although, what’s really the problem? #FreeTheNipple, right? Who could forget the moment when Justin Timberlake ripped Janet Jackson’s top, exposing her breast, during the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime performance? The event was deemed “Nipplegate,” and everyone was confused as to whether this was a premeditated wardrobe malfunction for publicity. The heiress and reality star was partying at the Shelborne Hotel on New Year’s Eve and some fellow attendees spotted her nipple. Paris didn’t seem to mind though—she partied on. Oops! Russian actress Svetlana Metkina’s breast popped out of her strapless dress while she was attending the American Foundation for Aids Research party at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. The wind was not kind to Lindsay Lohan when she walked the red carpet at the MTV Movie Awards in L.A. A large gust came through, sending her purple dress flying up to reveal her slip and black underwear. This one’s going to require a trip to the tailor: While attending the 62nd International Cannes Film Festival, the zipper on the actress and producer’s dress split down her back.  Fans caught a glimpse of Emma Watson’s nude underwear as she walked the red carpet for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. As Watson later told David Letterman, “At least I’m wearing underwear.” Janelle Monet was performing on stage at BET’s Rip the Runway and ironically, her pants ripped right down the back, revealing the singer’s underwear. Katherine Heigl suffered a huge malfunction when the strap of her red dress snapped while she was onstage at ShoWest in New York.  Lady Gaga is the queen of outrageous outfits, so it was no surprise when she showed up to the CFDA Fashion Awards in this black corset with tulle train. But the corset didn’t quite stay in place, revealing the singer’s boobs mid–runway walk. The wind is no one’s friend, especially if you’re wearing a dress. Paula Abdul had to momentarily pause after stepping out of her car for the X Factor auditions in Los Angeles because her skirt was lifted up by the breeze.  Nicki Minaj had her first major wardrobe malfunction on live TV while performing on Good Morning America. The singer’s left boob popped out of her shirt. Nicki denied rumors that the nip slip was staged for attention. Lydia Bright, an attendee at The Duke of Essex Polo Trophy at Gaynes Park, was shocked when a gust of wind from the helicopter propellers sent her dress flying.   At the Teen Choice Awards, The Vampire Diaries star’s navy-and-white A-line dress caught the wind, but luckily, her hand stopped the skirt from flying up just in time.  Micaela Schaefer attended the premiere of Men in Black 3 in Germany wearing a dress made out of VHS tape. The tape clearly isn’t the best material for a dress, as it revealed her black thong when the wind blew.  Sofia Vergara’s dress ripped down the back 20 minutes before Modern Family won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy. The actress wasn’t shy about the malfunction, tweeting a photo of the mishap. Her emergency wardrobe team quickly fixed the tear, and she made it to the stage just in time. Actress Stefanie Scott was quite surprised when her dress blew upward while walking down the red (or in this case, purple) carpet at Nickelodeon’s 26th Annual Kids’ Choice Awards. Perhaps she should take a cue from Kate Middleton and put weights in the hem of her dress? Lupita Nyong’o was celebrating her Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role award for 12 Years a Slave when the hem of her custom-made Prada gown snagged on a plant.  Only a future queen would look this graceful as the wind lifts up her skirt. While most of us would immediately fret, the Duchess of Cambridge seemed prepared with another layer underneath. Still, we had a mini heart attack just looking at this incident! At the MTV VMAs, Nicki’s black minidress split right in half when she was performing, but she held it together (literally) like a pro. It was such a seamless recovery that it almost looked like it was supposed to happen.  Erin Holland experienced a minor wardrobe malfunction when the zipper down her backside split at the Australian premiere of Jurassic World. Britney Spears has been deemed the queen of wardrobe malfunctions, so she knows just how to handle them. While performing in Las Vegas, the entire zipper of her tight jumpsuit broke and her dancers tried—for quite some time—to nonchalantly fix it while Britney, pro that she is, continued to perform. Elizabeth Olsen accidentally flashed the crowd her nude undergarments while attending a Miu Miu event in Paris. She quickly used her clutch as a shield...but not before photographers caught her surprised look.  On her way to the Versace show during Paris Fashion Week, Nicky’s see-through panel dress, well, proved it was definitely transparent when her butt was exposed walking up the stairs. Cute outfit though!   Dakota Johnson suffered a wardrobe malfunction while accepting her People’s Choice Award: Her Armani Prive top came undone when actress Leslie Mann hugged her. The Fifty Shades of Grey star joked, “Well, it’s not like nobody here hasn’t already seen my boobs.” While attending the London premiere of The Legend of Tarzan, Margot Robbie’s Miu Miu gown came undone. Her costar, Alexander Skarsgård, came to the rescue and caught it before this moment became too NSFW. Xenia Tchoumitcheva attended the European Premiere of Suicide Squad in London and accidentally revealed she...wasn’t wearing anything under her dress when she spun around. Chrissy Teigen accidentally flashed her “hooha” (as she refers to it) at the 2016 AMAs. She took to Instagram to apologize in the most Chrissy Teigen way possible: In her caption, she wrote, “Apologies to anyone harmed mentally or physically by my hooha.”

			 But where's Zayn??? At Monday night's Met Gala, Gigi Hadid wore a dress that looked just as much like a butterfly wing as it did a work of stained-glass art. Her one-shoulder gown, designed by Versace, featured a thigh-high leg slit and long dark blue train. She also accented her blonde hair with gold pins on each side.  While her sister Bella channeled an evil (but still beautiful!) queen in an all-black ensemble and and high collar, Gigi went the opposite direction in a glowing, beaded, and very angelic-looking dress.  And although there's usually a no-selfie rule at the Met Gala (which no one pays attention to) Gigi found the time on that busy carpet to snap a quick and super cute pic with Salma Hayek!   Notably absent, though, was Zayn Malik, Gigi's maybe-but-maybe-not ex BF, since they were spotted kissing at the end of April just one month after they confirmed their breakup on social media. They did make an iconic robot/cyborg couple at the event in 2016.  Here's hoping he and his robot arm make a surprise appearance!  Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 You'll want to wear these styles for nine months straight.  Being pregnant can be one of the most exciting times of your life, but it can also make you feel uncomfortable and not in control of your constantly-changing body. I'm talking swelling! Cravings! Queasiness! Sounds amazing, right? While maternity leggings can't solve ALL of these issues (we wish!), they'll definitely make you—and your growing lil bump—feel more comfy and supported, whether you're on your feet all day or you're just lounging around the house.  
  You want them to perform the same as your fave pair of regular leggings, while providing extra benefits for a mama-to-be—e.g., having a thicker compression band and added back support. There are tons of options on the internet from workout ones to stylish faux-leather designs, and below, we've rounded up 21 of the absolute best maternity leggings based on actual customer reviews—including this Lululemon pair Cosmo's own beauty director, Carly Cardellino, couldn't stop talking about. They're that good. So prepare to feel cozy throughout your pregnancy and beyond with all these styles!

			 Whether you're wearing something backless, plunging, or have spaghetti straps, there's a bra hack for you.  If you hate going braless but still love complicated, strappy, backless, and plunging dresses, finding a practical bra you can wear without the straps showing can be a challenge. But where traditional bras fail, these weird and wonderful non-bras step in to save the day, keeping you lifted and in place, even in the most challenging dresses.  
 These straps attach to a normal bra and wrap around the front of your torso to make the back dip lower. They'll give you those much-needed extra couple of inches you need to pull off that slightly-too-low-backed dress without buying a completely new bra.  These clips pull your bra straps together so they're hidden and give you a little extra lift and cleavage, too. They also come in different shades like black, brown, and gray so they can blend in with bras you already own.  The front closure helps bring your breasts together, and the convertible straps give you lift that otherwise would be impossible. This bra is best for A, B, and C cups and make sure you don't use any lotion or body oils beforehand so the adhesive is at its best.  Perfect for necklines that extend below your sternum, this bra won't show if you're wearing a dress that's lower than usual. It's a great option if you need a little more lift than a nipple petal, and you can also wear it strapless.  Sometimes there's absolutely no way to wear a regular bra without it showing, and for these situations, breast petals are your best bet. For C-cups and under, these breast petals will make you feel covered and prevent nip-slips. They're also painless to take off (i.e. they're sticky enough to stay on, but won't leave any red marks) and sweat-resistant, so they'll stay on even if they get wet.

			 Straight from heaven. Kendall Jenner wasn't in New York City for NYFW because she was in California, rocking some ~super sexy~ fringe out on a dinner date with older sis' Kourtney Kardashian, who was wearing an equally sexxxy black ensemble. The two headed to Craig's in West Hollywood looking like two hot angels — one sweet and innocent in baby pink and the other badass b in ~risqué~ sheer black. I don't know what I'm talking about, but check it out and tell me I'm wrong: I'm wrong, aren't I? Anyway, hooray for cute clothes! I have nothing else to say about any of this! Bye!

			 "I, in no way, was trying to be racist or show cultural appropriation. It was, in fact, cultural appreciation."  Keziah Daum, an 18-year-old high school senior, was looking for a dress to wear to her senior prom and found one at her local vintage store, Decades, in Salt Lake City, Utah. "I was looking for a dress that was going to be modest in the neckline but also unique," she says. "I’ve always admired the beauty and uniqueness of the Chinese dresses, so I went to that section. I saw that dress, and I was like, ‘OK, this is the dress.’"  But what she chose, a  bright, traditional Chinese qipao (or cheongsam) dress, sparked an online debate when she tweeted the photos on April 22, the day after her big night, with the caption "PROM."  PROM pic.twitter.com/gsJ0LtsCmP One user found the images she posted and wrote a response that went viral, and Daum's photos found their way into a Twitter Moment. My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. https://t.co/vhkNOPevKD On prom night, Daum says she received compliments from strangers, waiters at the restaurant she and her friends went to, and teachers, so she was sad and confused when she learned people were offended by her outfit choice. "I definitely was not expecting it," she said. "I, in no way, was trying to be racist or show cultural appropriation. It was, in fact, cultural appreciation." Many users came out in support of Daum, while others quickly denounced her dress as cultural appropriation. The qipao, in an early form, was baggy and worn predominantly by upper-class women during the Qing dynasty, which ruled China for more than 250 years until 1912, according to The New York Times. The style then began to merge with Western culture over the decades; it became shorter, featuring slits and tapered waists, evolving into the tight-fitting style that's well-known today. "At first, I felt bullied, but my mom helped toughen me up, and I began to realize how many people there were who were supporting me in my decision and encouraging me," Daum says. "I learned that there’s always people who are going to hate and I can’t control that." And while Twitter is in an uproar about her prom dress choice, some people in China are supporting her decision.  The story of the Chinese prom dress worn by @daumkeziah that angered a mob of American online activists has reached China. The South China Morning Post reports on how the high schooler is receiving outpouring of support there. https://t.co/mrjcPK1vhC “To Chinese, it’s not sacred and it’s not that meaningful,” said Hung Huang, a Beijing-based writer and fashion blogger, in an interview with The New York Times.  Some people took to Weibo, a China-based blogging platform, to write that Daum looked beautiful. “Culture has no borders," wrote one user. "There is no problem, as long as there is no malice or deliberate maligning. Chinese cultural treasures are worth spreading all over the world.” 
 Daum says the controversy hasn't lessened her fun prom-night memories. "I would, in fact, wear that dress again," she says. "I would buy others like it, because I think it’s a beautiful piece of clothing."   Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Bright hues for winter? Groundbreaking.   It might be the fact that the sun cruelly sets at, like, 4:30 p.m. or that the thought, "Will I ever feel warm again?" crosses my mind at least five times a day, but when the winter months start to take their toll, I dress like I'm going through an abnormally-late goth phase.  
  Suddenly, my cozy all-gray lounge sets, thick black sweaters, and my darkest pairs of jeans come out to play. Here's the thing: I do own colorful cold-weather clothes. But, every winter I continually find myself drawn to grays, browns, navys, and blacks, and the other two-thirds of my closet goes the entire season feeling ignored.  However, everything changed when I bought a pair of mustard-colored J. Crew pants last December.  "Yes, I know they're mustard, but they're on sale and SO cute," I reasoned to myself in my head (as I do with all my online purchases). As soon as I put them on, I fell in love and they weirdly inspired me to try to stay away from deeper colors this season (emphasis on *try*). In doing so, I actually had a LOT more fun with my outfits. If you've found yourself in the same rut, consider the below outfit ideas to incorporate more color into your life.  
  Camel Is the New Black In the past, I would wear a black winter coat faster than you could say, "Nor'easter," but this camel one is the best of both worlds: it's still a neutral so it complements all of my clothes, but it stands out from the sea of dark outerwear that's everywhere in NYC. Yes, it's not a blindingly bright outfit by any means, but when paired with overalls, a striped turtleneck, and equally tan shoes, it mixes colors together in a way that was different from my previous (i.e. depressing-looking) winter outfits.  (Attempting to) Bring the Heat Entering my new ~colorful~ phase, I opted for a fire-engine red faux-fur coat to match my cropped sweater, but balanced out the bold hue with a pair of dark-wash jeans and cream boots with a gold heel. While the denim is a deep blue (which I tried my best to stay away from), I figured the other pieces in the ensemble more than made up for it.  Green Isn't Just for the Holidays This sweater was just sadly sitting in my closet post-Christmas. To wear it past the the month of December, I decided to pair it with these blue-and-white checkered wide-leg pants. I continued the blue theme with a pair of two-toned socks and, because I didn't want to go too overboard, I opted for simple black mules. I also added a pair of multicolored mismatched crystal earrings to add a little something *sparkly*.  Muppets, But Make it Fashion  This was my most adventurous ensemble, but I fully committed to an unconventional color scheme to really get outside my (some might say, safe) fashion box. Once I put on this yellow faux-fur moto jacket and olive pants I was weirdly into it—even if it was a tad "Kermit" on the bottom and "Big Bird" on top. I added a subtle pattern in the form of snakeskin boots and then completed it with a bright white bag to tie it all together.  The Takeaway Winter is far from over, but by welcoming brighter colors into my wardrobe, I actually looked forward to getting dressed each morning. It was fun to see what combinations I could come up with (whether you agree or disagree with them), and I don't see myself stopping any time soon.  
  I did give in to wearing black every now and then (basically if I was running late and didn't have time to think through color schemes), and while it was nice to go back to that familiar hue, I felt like those looks were rushed and more snoozy when compared to my bold, bright styles. I enjoyed pushing my boundaries a little and the process actually helped me gain more confidence with my outfits. So if you've found yourself in the same situation, 10/10 would recommend bursting out of your dark-clothing bubble and buying. All! The! VIBRANT! Things! Below!

			 All donation funds will go toward suicide prevention and mental health causes.  Following designer Kate Spade's recent death, the Kate Spade New York brand announced this morning via Instagram that it will donate more than $1 million to mental health causes and suicide prevention. Spade sold all of her shares of the company she founded alongside her husband Andy Spade in 2006. "In honor of our company founder, Kate Spade, we're donating to mental health awareness causes. We'll match your donations, too," the brand wrote in classic Kate Spade script. The first donation from the total $1 million is a generous $250,000 to Crisis Text Line, a not-for-profit organization that provides crisis intervention via text message. Through the free service, texters are anonymously connected to a crisis counselor expertly trained to "bring texters from a hot moment to a cool calm through active listening and collaborative problem solving."  The donation to Crisis Text Line is only the first to be announced, and the remaining $750,000 in funds will go exclusively to other mental health awareness and suicide prevention causes. And from June 20 to 29, the Kate Spade New York Foundation will match public donations made to Crisis Text Line, up to $100K.  On the day of her passing, Kate Spade New York posted the following message on Instagram in honor of its legendary founder.  "Kate Spade, the visionary founder of our brand, has passed. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly heartbreaking time. We honor all the beauty she brought into this world," the brand wrote. Family, friends, and the fashion industry alike remember Kate Spade for her whimsical personality and analogous designs. Her brand represented the modern woman, who is steadfast in her career while also celebrating a sort of champagne spirit.  If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). To speak with a Crisis Text Line counselor, text "HOME" to 741741.

			 "No, mom, they're like this on PURPOSE."     My mom gave me my first-ever pair of diamond earrings as a high school graduation present. I treasured them so much that I wore them basically every day. So it kinda stung when she called me up post-college to tell me, "As much as I love that you wear them, you should try something different for a change!" I eventually realized her not-so-subtle hint was spot on—I was in desperate need of a new style. Shortly after, a huge online sale hit and I took a major leap, buying a single hook earring from Charlotte Chesnais, because, IDK, it was just the coolest-looking piece of jewelry I had ever seen?! Now, paired with a simple gold stud, it's one of my favorite combos to wear. (FYI, it's this one right here, still available at Net-a-Porter, if you're so inclined.) 
  Luckily for me, my mom, and pretty much everyone else, mismatched earrings have been popping up all over Instagram and all the best online retailers. The trend is actually so versatile—especially when you have multiple piercings to experiment with.   minimal, statement🌷 Mismatched Tulips #anitabjewelry A post shared by  ANITA BERISHA (@anitabjewelry) on Oct 13, 2018 at 8:28am PDT If you, too, have found yourself in an accessory rut and want to try out something truly eye-catching, shop the below galleries. Everyone asking, "OMG, where did you get those earrings?!" will be an added bonus. Mix and match your piercings with a bunch of different single earrings, whether they're hoops, charms, studs, or pendants. You can pair them with pieces you already own, or wear a couple of these individual styles together. If you're not a fan of shopping for single earrings, there's plenty of thoughtfully mismatched pairs here for you. Opt for a style that inverses colors or choose one that has two totally different—but somewhat related—shapes for an eye-catching look.  Want to make even more of a statement? Choose earrings that have different lengths on each side— you'll love to switch them around from ear to ear.

			 Legit, everyone on Amazon is obsessed with this hat.  Looking cute when freezing cold weather forces you to bundle up is hard. It’s just not practical to rock your favorite throwback hair clip when the temperature is approaching zero, no matter how tempting it may be to throw caution to the wind—er, snow. Luckily for you, I just stumbled across a must-have winter accessory during my daily Amazon stroll. Not only is she cute. Not only is she warm. She's also 18 percent off right now. Hello, teddy-bear-eared beanie of my dreams!  Can we talk about those pom-pom ears for a second? I’m obsessed! And the cable-knit cap is handcrafted from an acrylic blend, which means it’s strong, stretchy, and comfortable. The inside is even lined with fleece to keep you extra cozy. Catch me rocking this baby every time the temp dips below 50.  Also, wait, here’s the best part: it comes in SO MANY colors. I counted 13 options on Amazon, including red, burgundy, yellow, black, gray, khaki, navy, pink, and purple. One for every day of the week!  It’s part of Amazon’s Choice program, which means the hat has been vetted by a bunch of shoppers for being highly rated, well-priced, and available to ship immediately. And I wasn’t kidding about the reviews. It has 4.6 stars out of five, with customers in the comments dropping love notes like “quite possibly my favorite hat!” and “grownup-approved cuteness.” At this price point, I may even have to treat myself to two colors. Shh, don’t tell my budget!  shop now

			 She looks *so much* like her aunt.  Princess Diana had a flair for fashion when she was alive, and it looks like her niece, Lady Kitty Spencer, does too. Spencer modeled in Dolce and Gabbana's  "Secrets & Diamonds" show last night and was practically the spitting image of her late aunt. She even wore a tiara!  The 27-year-old model is the oldest daughter of Princess Diana's brother, Earl Charles Spencer, making her Prince William and Harry's cousin. The show was an eveningwear-only presentation, and other millennial British royals walked with Spencer, like Ladies Violet, Alice, and Eliza Manners.  Spencer documented the evening on her Instagram, as all the models and millennials do. Her she is with legendary makeup artist Pat McGrath getting ready before the show.

			 Inclusivity is stylish as hell. On Tuesday, Macy's announced that it will sell the Verona Collection, comprising hijabs, tops, dresses, pants, and sweaters, beginning Feb. 15. It marks the first time the major retailer has sold a modest dressing clothing line. "Verona Collection is more than a clothing brand," the label's founder, Lisa Vogl, said in a statement. "It's a platform for a community of women to express their personal identity and embrace fashion that makes them feel confident on the inside and outside."

Eventually, participating members can partner with Macy's to sell their clothing in stores and online, just like the Verona Collection. "Macy's has been an amazing partner," Vogl said, "helping us strengthen the foundation of our business through The Workshop at Macy's and now introducing our brand to their consumers through this collaboration."

			 It’s also an animal sanctuary where you can get up and close and personal with lotsa zebras, FYI. When I went to Cuixmala, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve site approximately 3 hours from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, this week, I got so many DMs being like “Hey, where TF even are you?!” And I get it, because one second I was drinking margs and eating tacos, the next I was horseback riding next to zebras, spotting crocodiles, and then relaxing at the beach.

Everywhere you look, you can find one that provides the perfect canvas for your next  OOTD, like this one I took with the Google Pixel 3 phone Revolve gifted me.

Like I said, there’s a farm here on-site, and there are bunnies galore. You can pet them, but I can’t promise they’ll take a good selfie. Plz swipe through this Insta pic to see what I mean, LOL.  Things were going well until they weren’t. ➡️ to see what I mean. 😲 #revolvesummer @revolve A post shared by  Becca Tilley (@beccatilley) on Jul 11, 2019 at 2:49pm PDT Spend a day in a private beach cove.  You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about 🎶... #revolvesummer A post shared by  racheltorgs (@racheltorgs) on Jul 11, 2019 at 1:43pm PDT The ocean in this exclusive spot, which was about a 45-minute drive from the main resort area but so worth it, was legit bath water. So. Warm. And so clear!  Drive around to see the rest of the animals, including crocs. Zebras, antelopes, migratory birds, crocodiles, and iguanas are all over the resort, and you can ride around and see them everywhere! The crocs are kinda scary, not gonna lie, but they’re not close to any of the places tourists stay (remember, this resort is 30,000 acres!!). Cuixmala also releases baby sea turtles into the ocean at sunset and you can witness it, and that’s just adorable and the best.  Rise & Shine!  #Cuixmala #ecotourism #seaturtle A post shared by  Cuixmala (@cuixmala) on Apr 2, 2018 at 10:10am PDT Take. Me. Back!!!! Gahhh.

			 The line, which goes up to 4X, had previously only been sold on the brand's website. Old Navy announced on Tuesday that its women's plus collection, which had previously only been sold online, will now be sold in stores.  
  The line ranges from 16 through 30 and 1X through 4X and debuts today in 75 store locations across the U.S.  A statement from the label revealed that Old Navy currently offers one of the most inclusive ranges in the industry. It has 74 different sizes across its array of options (00-30, XS-XXL & 1X-4X in Regular, Petite, Tall, Short, and Long).  “Here  at  Old  Navy,  we believe  in  the  democracy  of  style.

			 This is wild. On Saturday, celebrity-type people all came out to celebrate Khloe Kardashian's man Tristan Thompson's birthday in L.A. Kourtney Kardashian was one of the people who showed up! She wore this: It's a green suit with matching tapered trousers and an oversized, '80s-style blazer. She paired it with black sandals and a Dior saddle bag. It was missing one major element: a shirt. Does that surprise you? At this point, I feel like it is just an accepted styling trick that many celebrities, including Kardashians, employ. The thing that really shocked me is how (her seemingly on-again boyfriend) Younes Bendjima wore his jean jacket! Look!  It's looped above one shoulder and under his opposite arm like a fanny pack or cross-body bag. Is this something we're all going to be doing soon? Is it cooler than knotting a jacket around your waist or wearing it over your shoulders with your arms not in the arm holes? Do I like how this looks? Do YOU? Where do we all go from here? Also, if you are interested, Kourtney is using Kim's old hack — lifting up her boobs with gaffer tape — for support and coverage here. You can just make out the black tape in this last pic. Anyway, if you liked Kourtney's suit, shop a similar one below! Get non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBeauty. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 "Although I understand what Vogue Italia's intentions were, it was not executed correctly."  On Thursday, Gigi Hadid took to Instagram Stories to offer an apology for her latest Vogue Italia cover, after what she explained as post-production editing prompted blackface allegations from commenters. Hadid posted a photo of herself after the shoot took place, noting how bronzed she actually was during the photoshoot. However, she said she doesn't believe the cover was "executed correctly."  Her full statement reads:  On Wednesday, Vogue Italia had debuted the cover for its May issue featuring Hadid on Instagram, shot by much-renowned fashion photographer Steven Klein (a Vogue Italia mainstay). Hadid also posted the photo on her Instagram, but has since taken it down.  "This is absolutely racist trash. Why are you photoshopping poor @gigihadid into a completely different human being. If you want a girl of darker skin tone then HIRE ONE," one commenter wrote on Vogue Italia's photo.  And in addition to the allegations of racism, fans were also quick to point out that even her features seemed heavily altered in post-production.  "This doesn’t look like Gigi at all, not even her facial features. If you book a model, take the model as the beauty she or he is and don’t make her look like a completely different person," another user wrote.  Vogue Italia is no stranger to courting racial controversy. Under the leadership of the late editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, the magazine printed a fashion editorial titled "Haute Mess" in 2012, which received criticism for its racial undertones. Two years later, an editorial featured images of a Dutch model in a shoot titled "Abracadabra,"  in which she posed with taxidermied African animals in face paint; in that same year the publication also segregated its fashion week street style photos by race on its website.  Update 5/4 9:54 a.m.: Vogue Italia contributing Editor-at-Large Patti Wilson responded to the controversy in an Instagram post on Thursday. She defended the cover, and said, "Gigi was meant to look bronze, tan, and gorgeous. Nothing more than that." Read her full statement below: Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Commenters are roasting this jeweler on Facebook. A British jeweler called Theo Fennell released a student-made collection called "Gilded Youth," and all you really need to know about it is that this piece from it was posted to Facebook on Monday: Do you notice anything about it? Like, how it is made of both silver and gold and has a nice teardrop-shaped purple gem in the middle? According to the jeweler's FB page, "This pendant was designed by Lukas Grewenig as part of our Gilded Youth initiative. The design is inspired by the way a goldsmith assesses a stone by placing it between their index and middle finger." Ah, yes... of course! Well, while that might be what Theo Fennel says about this piece, it is NOT what everyone else is seeing — they're seeing a silver vulva and a bright purple clit. Heyo! Commenters on FB have been having a field day, and here are a few of my personal favorite responses: Now, please peruse the full Facebook post in all its glory: Just so you know, the piece is on display in the jeweler's store this week, so if you happen to be in the area, please report back on how it looks in person. Thank you, Theo Fennell. You're a gem. Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Okay, maybe LOVE is a strong word, but you get it.  Whether you’re a fashionable student, a fashionable professional, or just a fashionable human who wants convenience, a backpack for commuting is the best way to get you AND your stuff from here to there—wherever you’re headin’. Here, 23 trendy bags that’ll replace that worn-out work tote of yours.  This simple gray backpack with black contrast will go with every outfit. It also fits a 15-inch Macbook and all your other work essentials thanks to its three outer pockets and roomy interior. This open-top style allows you to clearly see everything inside—even your lipsticks all the way at the bottom of the bag. Plus, its multiple outside pockets will keep you super organized. We’ve all seen the Fjällräven backpack, but have you ever seen it in this cute print? This special-edition pattern will definitely add more fun to your daily commute. It can be difficult to find a design that’s just the right size—i.e., not overwhelmingly large and not too mini—but this Herschel Supply Co. option is just that. It’ll fit a 13-inch laptop without looking oversize on your back, and it also comes in seven(!) other colors. This backpack’s bright and muted color combo gives it a sporty vibe. It’s also an excellent choice if you’re hiking or commuting, since it securely closes with a drawstring and buckle. A style with its own laptop compartment helps keep your computer from jostling around in your bag. If you want a backpack that’s a little unexpected, opt for one with a distressed metallic print and studded details. It also has striped lining inside for something even more unexpected. With six interior pockets and three exterior pockets, this small backpack packs a serious organizational punch. Plus, the quilted material cushions any fragile items inside. A smaller style is best when you don’t take your computer with you, and this cutie (complete with a tassel zipper and gold metal accents) is great for your personal items. It’s so elevated that you can use it as a purse on the weekends too! This amazing tote and backpack in one stuffs into its own pocket, making it arguably the most convenient bag on this list! The nylon fabric is lightweight and durable, whether you carry it by the top handle, over the shoulder, or as a backpack. This leather backpack is perfect for flat items like a computer, notebooks, binders, and papers, and it has three compartments so you can keep them all organized. The silhouette and worn-in look only adds to the style’s retro feel. Because of this padded shape, the structure always stays the same—i.e., the spacious main compartment never gets floppy even when it’s not full. Your back will appreciate the cushioning too. Commuting with a little one in tow requires supreme organizational skills. This striped guy has ALL the compartments too, meaning you can stash baby wipes separately from your laptop. This travel gear company was started by Shay Mitchell, who knows a thing or two about being on the go. The main compartment zips open to carry work things, gym things, and just general life things in separate compartments. This classic tan hue and simple design (save for the perforated trim at the bottom) won’t clash with your work outfit, but it’s still big enough that you can fit everything you need. Pull-through straps instantly convert this genius water-resistant bag from tote to backpack. Whether you work out at the beginning or end of the day still means you’re commuting with a change of clothes, sneakers, and socks. This design is roomy enough to fit all those things, and the animal print adds fun to the schlep. Not looking to drop a ton? Great news! This pink bb is sophisticated and also just $16, so you can tote your sh*t in style knowing you scored an amazing deal. Sometimes you gotta stick with what you’re familiar with—in this case, a Jansport bag. Sure, you probs owned one in high school...but doesn’t it look way more modern in a bright white shade with tan and black accents? A neoprene backpack adds a sporty look to your everyday commute. Extra side compartments are available for loose items or your water bottle, and the padded shoulder straps will make carrying heavier things a cinch. A vegan leather backpack that looks like real leather will make you feel better about your environmental impact. This gorgeous tan style has a HUGE compartment and a structured shape so it won’t slump over when you set it on the ground. Want a sophisticated yet functional design? Add this top-rated, sleek backpack, which takes up minimal space, to your cart ASAP. If you’re into silver metal and a moto-chic aesthetic, this black one—that also has a laptop sleeve—is totally for you. The outside pocket is protected thanks to the hook closure, and the zippers are easy to handle with their studded tassels.

			 Matching your clothes has never been easier.  To whoever made up that dumb rule, "Don't wear white after Labor Day," maybe this isn't for you. But if you're super on board the all-white outfit train, then here's some inspiration for your summer wardrobe—and beyond.  Cowboy boots are becoming the newest fashionable shoe, so wear them with a denim midi skirt and cream sweater to get in on the style.  A strapless dress is extra flirty with a bow detail at the neckline. Pair it with a straw bag featuring white pom poms and strappy neutral sandals to make it even cuter.  If you're a fan of matching sets, a lace one featuring a long-sleeve crop top and high-waisted shorts is definitely for you. Add a beaded bag to the mix, and then you can dress it up with high-heel clogs or down with flat sandals.  Have a hectic day ahead of you? Opt for a soft printed T-shirt, wide-leg-pants and flats that will be comfortable all day.   Distressed jeans make an all-white outfit a little more edgy, while a pair of beige high-heeled sandals dress up the plain pocket tee.  A midi with subtle stripes and leg slits would look amazing on a beach boardwalk. With lace-up block-heeled sandals and gold statement earrings, you can take it from brunch to the bar.  A body-hugging crop top and skirt looks even sexier with a chain bag and see-through heels.  An off-the-shoulder top worn with a lace maxi skirt is perfect for a dinner date that's not super fancy. Tassel earrings and white sandals complement the rest of the summery outfit.  Going for effortless attire? Pair high-rise skinnies with Converse high tops and a slightly see-through button down.  Belted wide-leg pants + Teva sandals + a bustier crop top = the ultimate combo of low-key and flirty.  A denim miniskirt with contrast stripes on the sides and a matching bra top makes for an amazing street style outfit. Complete it with zipper booties for an extra hot lewk.  Throw on a checkered blazer over a white tee and cropped jeans for an office-friendly ensemble, while the espadrilles aren't overly professional.  If you have a seaside vacation booked, get yourself a dress that doubles as a beach coverup and a retro-looking white one-piece.  If you're a girl on the go, an overall dress, white sneakers, and a gingham handbag is a trendy outfit you can easily throw together before heading out the door.  If you think an all-white outfit is a little too plain for you, how about one that has cute polka dots? A matching denim jacket and skirt adds some flair, while white Converse and a simple T-shirt pull it together.

			 Because it's always too soon to give a love fern. Congrats! You have a valentine this year, which means instead of just enjoying candy from your mom, now you have to stress about what to get your partner. Here's a list of awesome Valentine's Day gifts for him depending on how long you've been together.  It hasn't been that long, so you can probably get away with not giving a gift, but you do risk an awkward moment if he showers you with stuff and you're all empty-handed. Instead, go with something classic. A cool bottle of his favorite booze, a Netflix gift card, or a book you think he might like are harmless yet amazing gifts for anyone, really. And, of course, it wouldn't be Valentine's Day without candy, and chocolate of any kind is appreciated by basically everyone.   Y'all been at it for half a year, so you can loosen up a bit. You can make jokes about his weird big toe, and you've got a good grasp on his interests. This is the perfect time to get him a quirky gift, such as beard balm, or something practical, like a nice shirt. If he has a hobby like coffee-making, he’ll definitely nerd out over the effing cool-looking pot below. And, of course, you can never go wrong with a Fire TV Stick so you can watch all your favorite shows together. Now is probably a good time to spend a *little* more money on him than you have before. If he loves sneakers, he’ll probably love a shiny new pair, or if he’s really into craft beer, get him a sampler like the one below. A new wallet or a bottle of cologne are other tasteful, classic gift ideas. Chances are you’ve already given him a handful of presents for other occasions and might be running out of ideas. Time to get a little creative. Maybe give a gift you ~both~ can enjoy, like tickets to a game or a concert, or a cute tray for working and eating in bed. It could also be time to update his headphones or watch.  ticketmaster.com prices vary BROWSE NOW If you’ve been dating a few years, the Valentine’s Day hoopla may not be all that exciting to you guys anymore. But it's still a perfectly good excuse to celebrate another year of being together! Sentimental gifts, such as a funny card with an inside joke or a journal of little love notes, show you care without having to spend too much money. If you feel like spoiling him, splurge on a gadget he's been eyeing, or surprise him with a weekend trip to a destination you’ve both always want to visit—and give him a stylish duffle to go along with it.

			 Those runway videos on Instagram have finally paid off.  Alert: Britney Spears just landed her first major fashion campaign for Kenzo.  The singer took to Instagram to reveal her new campaign for the brand's Memento N°2 collection, photographed by Peter Lindbergh. In the image, Britney serves up some early 2000s vibes in a denim trucker hat and cropped green sweatshirt that shows off her lower back tattoo. Yesterday, the brand teased their A-list casting on Instagram with a quick video showcasing the "mystery" star (but really, who couldn't recognize Britney's runway walk and blonde waves from a mile away?).  Perhaps the greatest part of the campaign is the recreation of her famous all-denim red carpet look from the 2001 American Music Awards. In one of the photos, the singer poses in a hat, jacket, over-the-knee boots and even underwear all made from jeans.  Though in the past she's fronted many ads for her Candie's x Kohl's collection and a vast lineup of fragrances, this marks Britney's first campaign for a major fashion brand.  It looks like all those modeling videos on Instagram have finally paid off. Now someone please take note and cast Britney in her big Fashion Week debut. She's ready.

			 Perfect for climbing the Grand Canyon, a small hill, and everywhere in between.  Just because you'll be either sweating (or freezing!) outdoors doesn't mean you can't look cute! Whether you're a pro on the trails or are planning a leisurely trek—and preferably treating yourself with mimosas afterward—these 14 outfits will give you serious hiking wardrobe inspo.  Hikes are tricky because one second you can be cold, and once you're into your climbing groove, you're profusely sweating. With a white cropped tank, sneakers, a baseball cap, and matching leggings, you'll stay comfortable throughout your trek.  A spaghetti strap tank with black leggings, thick socks, and sturdy boots will definitely hold up if you're planning to make an all-day adventure out of it. Tall stick not required, but it looks cool, no?  If you're not one to bail on outdoor activities even when there's rain or snow, you'll want gear that can withstand anything. A water-resistant and lightweight anorak, comfortable leggings, knit socks, and all-terrain boots will definitely keep you dry and warm.  A short-sleeve top with a mock neck and zipper detail with matching black-and-white leggings is the ultimate combo of sporty and sexy—pull the zipper as high (or low) as you like. Then pull it together with a pair of cool black kicks.  A long-sleeve jacket on top paired with breezy shorts on the bottom is the perfect outfit when temps are fickle. Throw on some white sneakers, and you're ready to take on the trail.  A jersey tank with mesh details at the arms will keep you cool, and the orange color reflected on the bottoms will match any canyon you're walking through. Complement it with white shoes and you're set.  A zip-up sports bra with a matching pair of two-tone pants is the right mix of casual and chic—add a pair of pink shoes to make it even trendier.   A quilted jacket with contrast details will keep you cozy and burgundy capri leggings with black sneakers pull the whole outdoorsy vibe together.  A color-blocked track jacket with a logo tee, gray leggings, and sneakers will give your hiking look that low-key "off-duty model" vibe.  Leggings can so easily blend in, but a pair that has some lace-up action with ties at the ankle sets it apart from the rest. Add a matching top, leopard-print shoes, and a cream sweater around the waist and you'll look so dang stylish for your brunch plans later. An all-navy outfit featuring pants and a matching tank is offset by light stripes at the waistband and down each leg. Add some lilac shoes to commit to the cooler tones.  A pair of shiny cycling shorts will give you all-day comfort on the trail, while still looking fashion-forward. An oversized sweater and thick-soled shoes make it even edgier.  FYI, not everyone loves leggings, and that's OK! Free your gams with a pair of cute polka-dot running shorts, then wear a contrasting but equally spotted sports bra for a playful ensemble. Add crew socks and streamlined sneakers, and you're ready for whatever the hike has in store.  There's perhaps nothing more noticeable than neon orange bottoms—also, if you have a tendency to wander off, your friends can easily find you! Keep the attention on your leggings by sticking to a black sports bra and kicks.

			 Start saving that cash. There are a lot of expensive brands out there, but not all of them are worth the investment. Here, 23 luxury labels that aren't a waste of your hard-earned cash. You've definitely heard this name somewhere before, and if not, you've certainly seen this signature sandal. If you're interested in purchasing designer footwear, consider this label too, which is constantly adorning the feet of your favorite celebs and, yes, royalty—Meghan Markle has been known to favor them. Sure, Balenciaga enjoys trolling us all with Ikea knockoffs and double-shirts that make us scratch our heads, but the fact of the matter is the name still carries a lot of weight in the street style world. Flash it on your shoes or carry one of their signature handbags—and someone will instantly know you're with it. In 2018, Carly Cushnie took the helm of label Cushnie et Ochs, rebranding it under just her last name. The new line boasts the same impeccable tailoring and subtle sexiness the former brand was known for on red carpets all over the world. This designer basically solidified the wrap-dress as a wardrobe staple. Plus, her pattern play is genius. Safe to say a DVF piece will get you tons of compliments. Fendi's always been up there with the major designers, but especially with the current trend of logomania, it's a good bet. Those branded Fs are a major statement. Another house adored by royalty and celebs, this name has always been synonymous with indulgence and the effortlessly sultry style of Parisians. You'll recognize this double-G belt from pretty much any style blogger you follow on Instagram. Isabel Marant makes more than earrings, but aren't these gold ones with spherical details just too pretty to pass up? Yeah, same with the rest of her stuff. This big-ass hat (the brim flops down to mid-back) was in more photo shoots in 2018 than any Insta-famous model, it seemed. Of course, I can't back that up with any data, but you probably saw it on your feed at least once this year. Johnathan Simkhai is all about fitted silhouettes, intricate seam-work and fun details, like pleats and cutouts. Wearing a piece by this designer makes you feel sophisticated and daring all at the same time. This brand makes clothing too, but the real show-stoppers are the geometric bags, which come in prismatic shapes and intricate laser-cut basket-esque designs, like this one. A designer for cool girls, Monse takes staples of the past, like the varsity sweater, and upgrades them for the modern age. This brand really made waves back in 2015, when it felt like everyone had to have their signature bucket bag, pictured here in red. The brand is known for their sumptuous coats, and, in particular, this pretty and ultra fluffy teddy one. Playing with texture and color is definitely this designer's Thing. You may recognize this dress from when Miley Cyrus wore to the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party last year. OK, Prada has been around forever, but these flame heels are a new design that totally slays. Another favorite of the royals—both Meghan and Kate Middleton have worn the label—these designs feature playful cutouts, interesting hemlines, and, oftentimes, intricate lace patterns. Known for her sleek, modern aesthetic, you may recognize British designer Stella McCartney's design here as the one Meghan Markle wore as her second wedding dress. Ulla Johnson is known for a free-spirited, bohemian vibe, which isn't necessarily reflected in these boots here, but aren't they just too gorgeous not to buy? Former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham has that whole perfectly-tailored-sexy-minimalist thing going on, and, yes, you should definitely get in on it. Another designer that loves to play with patterns and cutouts, this time in a more boho way that celebs like Beyonce absolutely appreciate. Name a more iconic cross-body bag, I'll wait. You definitely know these three letters and so does everybody else.

			 And if you've ever seen her throw a left hook, you know she's not messing around.  Adriana Lima is no stranger to the fitness world—she started walking on the Victoria's Secret catwalk since she was 18 and the training is no effing joke. But after retiring last November, ending her 19-year stint for the lingerie brand, she had another announcement up her sleeve: Lima is PUMA's newest ambassador, and the Miami-based model—who boxes on the reg—says it was a natural next step.   say hello to my new sparring partner!! 🤜🤛 @PUMA!!! ❤️❤️💪 @pumaperformance #TeamLima #DoYou #ad A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Oct 1, 2018 at 7:12am PDT "Working out and sports have always been part of my life," she says, although not every type of exercise has stuck. She's tried aerobics, lifting weights, yoga, you name it, but it wasn't until she took up boxing when she was 19 that she found her fitness calling. At a PUMA's Mode XT event in Miami in December, where the brand gave influencers and fitness instructors a sneak preview of its newest shoe, Lima strapped on her gloves and sparred with her coach Dino Spencer and later with Olympic champion and fellow PUMA ambassador Usain Bolt. As someone unfamiliar with boxing (outside of watching Creed, of course), I had never seen anyone look so badass.     ⚡️⚡️Catching lightning bolts today from the one and ONLY @USAINBOLT himself...watch for #ModeXT coming in January 🔥🔥 @pumaperformance 👟👟 coach @dino5thstgym 📸 @ysaperez A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Dec 13, 2018 at 3:08pm PST  "The first time I saw boxing in my life, I was six years old," Lima said. "My mom’s friend came into the house and brought boxing gloves, and this lady to me was the coolest woman." She finally tried it out herself when she was 19 and never looked back.  "It wasn’t easy, but I wanted to challenge myself to learn. I’m 37 now so almost 20 years ago back in the day, boxing wasn’t really known for women, and I believe that now it’s different. It’s global. I felt very empowered after learning the combinations, and then I could see how strong I can be. I never saw myself like that, so it really gave me confidence."   Going into the weekend with a bang 👊🏼 📷: @ysaperez A post shared by  Adriana Lima (@adrianalima) on Apr 20, 2018 at 10:27am PDT She loves the intense full-body workout that punching, ducking, and blocking give her—along with the benefits of improved core strength and better balance. Oh, BTW: Although she said she's not one to compare, she thinks [women] are more technical than men when it comes to boxing. "I think we are better with coordination," she says. "It takes a lot of coordination to be moving your legs a certain way and your arms a certain way, and I think we have that on our side naturally." So if that doesn't make you want to sign up for a class and put her theory to the test, IDK what will.

			 I'm confused.  Well, here's some news that should be seriously great but is actually a little confusing.  Ashley Graham, a model/queen known for her body-positive activism (her Instagram hashtag is #BeautyBeyondSize!), has teamed up with NYC clothing company Rag & Bone for a DIY campaign* called Ashley by Ashley. The pictures are super cute, and the outfits are sexy and I want them! (But I can't have them! More on that in a minute!)   Fresh faced 📸 @mrjustinervin for @ragandbone’s DIY project (wearing the Isabel jeans) #rbDIY A post shared by  A S H L E Y  G R A H A M (@ashleygraham) on Apr 26, 2018 at 12:38pm PDT  This news got plenty of Ashley's fans excited — Rag & Bone traditionally only sells straight sizes — so they were thrilled that their iconic fave was presumably repping a roll out of more inclusive sizes.  Except here's the thing — everything Ashley's wearing appears to only be available in straight sizes. The jeans go up to a 32, which is the equivalent of a 13/14. However, some commenters say Rag & Bone jeans fit small, leading folks to ask if the company made larger jeans specifically for Ashley to wear in the ads. Which... is admittedly kinda strange! In a recent interview with British Vogue about the Rag & Bone collab, Ashley touched on her desire for clothing to be more inclusive. “The demand is there, especially for denim … there are many curvy women who are willing to spend money on quality, designer clothing, but often times they are not even given the opportunity because the sizes just don't exist. I think some high-end brands might think they are devaluing their brand if they extend their sizes — maybe they think they will become less exclusive — which is just ridiculous.” STRONG AGREE! But then, when I dug around the Rag & Bone site for a good 30 minutes, I couldn't find a size above 32.  So ... what's the deal?  If this is a sign that Rag & Bone is becoming more inclusive, that's thrilling! And if so, here's hoping they add the actual sizes to the website (and in stores! Bigger girls love to shop in stores, too!) soon.  But if not, I have some questions, first and foremost being: Why use an iconic body-positive model (known for modeling larger-sized clothing) to sell your stuff if you don't sell extended sizes? One of the (many) reasons Ashley is so popular is that she uses her powerful voice and body to promote inclusive brands that cater to a wider range of sizes (see again: her #BeautyBeyondSize hashtag), and that doesn't seem to be the case with Rag & Bone. That said, I trust that Ashley knows exactly what she's doing, and fingers crossed that my chunky ass will be able to buy all those cute Rag & Bone clothes soon. Until then, Premme, here I come! Cosmopolitan.com has reached out to Rag & Bone and Ashley Graham's reps for comment and will update this post if they respond.  *I've read the description of what DIY is like five times, but I'm still confused. Anyone? It appears to maybe just be a collection of a celebrity's favorite Rag & Bone pieces, but?! I mean, they made a pretty video but it explains NADA:

			 Byeee, uncomfy heels.   Sneakers have never been so in, folks. (Take a moment to praise the fashion gods for giving us a chic alternative to heels.) Whether you collect them obsessively or you're not sure if they're really your vibe, there is no denying they instantly make any look cooler—and WAY more comfortable too. But if you're wondering how to make them more ~elevated~, why not try them with skirts and dresses. Take a cue from these celebrities, It girls, and street-style stars for nine different ways to sport this refreshing combo this summer. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! Emily Ratajkowski masters this low-key, but sexy vibe in this ab-baring coordinating set. The bright orange is undeniably eye-catching, so more muted accessories (white sneaks and minimal sunnies) make it stand out even more. Want to break up the neon? Opt for a burgundy-colored crossbody to complement the rest of your 'fit.    When in doubt about what to wear, choosing one shade for your whole lewk makes your decision *so* easy. Because this three-piece set has an edgy aesthetic thanks to the grommet detailing, buckles, and zippers, these chunky, thick-soled kicks totally complete the ensemble. The pink hue, however, still makes it super flirty. Plus, all the metal details mean you can keep your accessories to a minimum—save for some retro cat-eye shades.  Dinner plans with a twist—literally. Jordyn Woods demonstrates her sneaker style with a knit maxi that features knotted fabric in the middle and two side cutouts. The whole outfit might seem casual, but the not-so-subtle show of skin and a leg slit takes this up a notch. Her hair scrunchy and printed saddle bag adds some extra cuteness too.     This vibrant street style ensemble from Sydney Fashion Week serves up an unexpected combo of silk and sneakers. The retro-looking shoes, Nike socks, and belt bag (worn over her shoulder) gives a sporty touch to this otherwise sleek outfit.   This ensemble is a classic summer go-to: a floral dress with white kicks. Hailey Baldwin transforms this strappy number into a running-errands look with the addition of her low-top Stan Smiths and delicate gold necklaces.  Another easy combo for ya? A leather mini and graphic tee to give them some edge. You'll feel so comfy throughout the day, but the skirt definitely keeps it stylish. If there's a lot of hardware on your bottoms (as seen here), a minimal sneaker that doesn't have too many details on it will look super polished.     Suiting is the best go-to when you want to feel put together without all the stress of figuring out if your outfit matches, including this extremely cute skirt suit. It's all business on top (except perhaps for the cropped tee), but the printed sneakers are very on-trend. Make it even more stylish with a clear tote, and it's a look that you'll love to wear both in and out of the office.    Think you can't wear sneakers to a date night? Well, just take one look at this situation. A floral-printed blazer dress with a tie at the waist is so sophisticated and, when styled together, a pair of plain black kicks can be too. Pro tip: Dark sneakers look dressier for an evening affair than bright white ones. Add an evening clutch and statement hoops to tie it all together.    If you love to layer, then a blazer-over-a-dress ensemble is definitely for you. The pink tones in the shoes also coordinate with the slip, while their chunky sole works well with the oversize silhouette of the jacket. If you're hitting up a happy hour after work, you can opt to remove it before you leave the office too.

			 Wow, why didn’t I think of these? Oh, wait. I did! LOL, bye. 2019 is wild, y’all. Granny glasses chains are a fashion statement that looks good as hell, Miley Cyrus is dating Cody Simpson, and someone is legit out here putting a used pregnancy test on a cake and serving it to guests. What does this have to do with Halloween? Not much, but I just had to get some things off my chest first.  Whatever you think of this trip around the sun, though, it’s safe to say there have been some memorable pop-culture moments. Moments that should absolutely be celebrated in the form of Halloween costumes. If you’re the type who likes to be particularly timely on All Hallows’ Eve, feast your eyes on the inspiring costume ideas below!  You’re welcome. @jlo @versace A post shared by  Laura Brown (@laurabrown99) on Sep 20, 2019 at 11:51am PDT Has there ever been a more iconic dress? Even if another comes to mind, this teal, floral-patterned Versace one—whether the OG from 200o with the sleeves or the 2019 version without sleeves—is up there. Help the moment live on forever, in the form of a costume.   The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share a photograph of Prince George and Princess Charlotte at Kensington Palace this morning. The photo was taken shortly before Their Royal Highnesses left for Thomas's Battersea. 📷 Kensington Palace A post shared by  Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Sep 5, 2019 at 8:00am PDT  Have you ever seen anything more adorable than royal siblings George and Charlotte heading into their first day of school? I died. Then I came back to life because I had a new purpose: to share exactly how to achieve their school outfits as a Halloween costume. The wand chooses the wizard, as they say. 
  So my friends and family are starting to get the @skims press boxes and I’ve never had a better response from everyone loving and feeling the product and this makes me so happy! I know shape wear better than anyone! I’ve been cutting and fitting and sewing my own versions of what I always wanted my shape wear to be and now everyone can have it too! We launch Sept 10th SKIMS.COM A post shared by  Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 6, 2019 at 12:20pm PDT Have you heard about the fact that Kim Kardashian’s line of shapewear just launched? Well, if you hadn’t heard, now you know. And—even better—you can be a ~Skims~ model for your Halloween costume if you want! All it takes is legit any kind of shapewear, some very on-point makeup, and some heels. If you really want to be authentic, score yourself the real deal on the Skims website—but fair warning, they’re almost all sold out. 
    Season 2 of HBO’s hit show is potentially even wilder than the first season, but perhaps its most iconic character is the one Meryl Streep plays. If you dress up as Mary Louise this year, please bring your best side-eye game and most passive-aggressive backhanded compliments. Not going to lie to you. I have not seen this movie, but everyone keeps talking about it and these denim jumpsuits are cute—and, more important, seasonally appropriate for October. Trick or treat! The table seen ’round the Facebook feed world. Relive one of the most important days in 2019 history by just straight-up being a table for Halloween. The costume is kind of a stretch, but the wide-brim hat is supposed to be the top of the table and the mermaid skirt represents the trumpet-shaped bottom of the table, lol. The poster board is for you to write, “RIP, Kylie & Jordyn’s friendship.” IDK, guys, it’s been a long day. 
 Win-win situation: Wear a sexy costume and be Miley Cyrus.  Legends. Live out your Western dreams in bedazzled blouses and 10-gallon hats. Also, play this great song on repeat all night long. 
 We could NOT get over this Starbs cup, y’all. We talked about it for days. Relive the glory of it all by dressing as the infamous item and by writing Daenerys’ long-ass name on it in Sharpie so people really get it. (Danaerys’ name in full is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, JSYK.) I dare you to name a more entertaining show than this one. You can’t, so don’t even try. 
 Confession time. I have not seen this film, because I refuse to watch horror movies (I’m a proud scaredy-cat), but I DO love these red utility suits, so.... 2019 was the year of Jonas, but more important, it was the year of Jonas wives. And possibly the most important event encapsulating this was this music video, which included over-the-top fashion and plenty of colorful and patterned suiting. 
 There are probably other celebrity feuds I personally care more about than this one, but friendship is nice and so are hamburgers and french fries, so here we are. 
 Rapid-fire round!!! Some more options in case you’re ignoring the ones I just neatly laid out above.

			 Bless up. There’s a reason Amazon is called The Everything Store. With thousands—if not hundreds of thousands of items available—Amazon offers great discounts on everything from yoga mats to wireless headphones to, yes, even activewear.  If you’re looking for some new sneakers, you’ll be thrilled to hear Amazon is offering sizable discounts on Adidas sneakers. From the fashionable Stan Smiths to a race-friendly pair of Cloudfoam Pure Running shoes, Adidas offers plenty of styles that deftly marry form and function. While Amazon’s not having an official sitewide blowout, you can find discounts on some great options. The one catch? Sale prices vary based on color and size. Sure, you might have to do some digging to find an awesome (and affordable!) pair, but whether you are in need of sneakers or want to add something new to your Adidas collection, it’ll be so worth it. $70$55 A casual outdoor pair has never been so comfortable, thanks to Adidas’ pillow-like cushion. $180$126 Don’t worry, guys, there’s a pair of Ultraboosts available for you too! $80.05$49 Adidas’ Run Lux Climas feature breathable mesh uppers so your feet won’t get too sweaty during a grueling workout. $65$55.99  A pair of crisp white sneakers will add a stylish edge to any outfit. $130$96.58 Between their knit material and snug, sock-like fit, these sneakers are so lightweight you’ll feel like you’re running barefoot. $80$56.30 Bring your love for Adidas off the track with these stylish kicks. $80$49.38 Between Adidas’ cloud-like cushioning and an OrthoLite sock liner, these shoes pack on the comfort throughout your workout. $65$56.70 If you already have several pairs of Adidas shoes in your sneaker closet, try on a pair of these simple canvas kicks for size.

			 Having trouble finding the perfect travel or commuting sandal? We have suggestions.  Finding a comfortable sandal is never easy, especially when you are sightseeing for long periods of time, or using them to commute to work on foot in the summer. Here's a tip: Look for shoes that have a padded footbed, adjustable straps, rubber outer soles, and lightweight materials. Scroll on for 16 pairs that check off all those comfy details and more!  These sandals have an insole that will mold to your foot and provide ample support during long walks.  You don't have to give up style with these snakeskin sandals. These wraparound shoes are built with extra cushion, flexible soles, non-slip treading, and lightweight materials.   These flatform espadrilles have a memory-foam footbed that makes every step feel cushiony.  The thick sole and the cushioned insole will keep you comfy, while the cage-straps and lace-up details will make your feet feel extra fashion-y.  These sandals have a disguised padded footbed that make them great for long walks. That cute blush color also goes with ev-er-y-thing. If you avoid slides in the summer because they make your feet sweat, listen TF up. These babies have breathable leather lining that actually doesn't overheat your feet! The contoured arch support isn't bad either.  The extra foam cushion on the bottom of these make 'em perfect for the sleek traveler. These lace-up sandals have a comfortable fit that'll allow you to go walk all around town, no breaks necessary. Plus, these happen to be Meghan Markle's fave sandals, but NBD.  The sport sandal made a big comeback this season and these platform Tevas will keep you on trend in style. A minimalistic gladiator sandal is always a good idea, especially when it has a squishy sole and comes in a color that goes with everything!  These mismatched sandals are actually as comfy as they are chic! Ortholite insoles plus rubber bottoms = walking on clouds and never slipping.  These buckled black sandals have an adjustable slingback that'll accommodate your heel and a footbed with extra cushion and arch support—your feet will seriously thank you.  These fashion-forward sport sandals are a new take on the classic "tourist" designs, but their molded footbed is what'll make them stand out to your feet.  These adorable two-toned platforms will ~elevate~ your look in seconds. Plus, rubber soles will help to stabilize each step.  These elegant slides have a contoured insole that will support your arches. Plus, they're doctor-approved, since the designer herself is a podiatric surgeon.  Looking for something that'll give you a lift but still make you feel supported? This block-heel sandal is a good bet. Plus, it is basically the perfect day-to-night shoe.

			 The Outnet's biggest summer sale has deals on deals on deals!! The Outnet is having its biggest summer sale yet with up to 85 percent off designer items. Yes, 85!!! These pieces won't be around for long—items are already selling out—so you'll want to snatch them up fast. Below are 16 of the best clothes and accessories from the sale. Even better news? They're all under $100.  White stripes on a pair of light-wash cutoffs are a subtle detail that differentiates a classic summer staple.  Dress your earlobes up with a stunning pair of artsy gold earrings that catch the light just right.  Tie-dye is making a comeback (along with so many other '90s trends), but a midi that has the fun pattern, but is also made of silk is one you can dress up or down.  Do you ever have no idea what shoes to match with your outfit? Yeah, well those days are over with a pair of criss-cross neutral slides.  If your phone case has seen better days, a summer sale is a great excuse to snag yourself a luxe gold one.  Add a pair of relaxed, straight-leg jeans to your cart if you're not a fan of ankle-constricting skinnies.   Espadrille slip-ons are like sneakers, but more summer-y because of the braided sole.  Add a necklace to your existing jewelry collection that looks just as great on its own as it is looks with your other gold pieces.  A crochet tank made from woven lamé is the perfect combo of beachy and chic.  Everyone loves a comfy shirt to sleep in, but one with stripes, a collar, and pocket is so fashionable you'll want to wear it just as much outside as you do in.  Wear a chambray romper by itself or over a casual shirt for a style that's just as trendy as it is versatile.  A two-toned blue bikini top with matching bottoms is the perfect combo of sporty and sexy.  If your closet is chock full of casual tanks, opt for a sleeveless style with a high neck and ruffle that will elevate any outfit.  Get yourself a pair of sandals that are great for the warm weather season because of their white floral pattern and lace-up details at the ankle.  A cover-up with fringe details and a low back that you can wear to the beach and also to drinks afterward is one you won't want to pass up.  Slip these babies on and it'll instantly add a pop of color to any ensemble.

			 Gimme all of 'em!!!  You wear them all the time, so why not learn more about all the cuts and silhouettes? Read up on the different styles and see which ones (if not all!) you're drawn to. Here, 16 types you'll want to check out.  Skinny jeans are known for their figure-hugging silhouette—the snug fit starts at the waist and extends all the way to the ankle. However, most offer stretch so it's easier to get your ankles into the smaller leg openings. They come in a variety of washes and rises depending on your preference, but these ones from Madewell are one of the brand's top-rated, comfiest pairs. Similar to skinnies but cropped! This shorter version gives your ankles some breathing room and looks killer with a pair of tall ankle boots or flats. Opt for a raw edge, like these best-selling AGOLDE ones, for added toughness or one with a normal hem for a more polished look.  Not quite skinny but not quite straight, these jeans are usually snug on the thigh area and then more relaxed over the calves. They often stop just an inch or two above the ankle. Style them with mules or slides for a more casual look or lace-up sandals for a dressier vibe. This Everlane pair has more than 700 reviews and a 4.6 star rating out of 5.  This style is similar to cigarette jeans except that they normally extend past the ankles. You can find them in an array of washes and rises, but if you're going for more of a retro look, definitely opt for a high-waisted pair, like this one from Reformation.  This cut has become more popular in recent years and is typically high-waisted, has roomy leg openings, and is cropped at the middle of the shin or lower. If you're looking for pants that feel breezy and look cool with sneakers, these will become your go-to.  Don't like cropped pants but still like the statement-making look of wider legs? Then these are for you. They look super sophisticated in darker washes with a belted waist, like these Eloquii ones, but can be low-key in a lighter wash with sandals and a T-shirt.  Similar to straight-leg jeans but with an all-around looser fit, these are not as constricting and can easily be dressed up or down. Opt for distressed details, like these Good American ones, for an even more *relaxed* vibe.  These aren't like the "Mom" jeans of the '80s. High-waisted cuts are back in a major way and are more fashionable then ever. They work perfectly with all your crop tops and sweaters because they hit right around the belly button. (Or in some cases higher or lower depending on the length of your torso.) This "Ribcage" design from Levi's is one of the brand's most popular pairs.  While high-waisted jeans seem like they've taken over, low-rise pairs haven't fully disappeared—and they're actually on their way back into fashion. This silhouette features a button and zipper closure right above your hips if you don't like jeans that go any higher.  These jeans are insanely comfortable thanks to their slightly baggy fit. Many come with the hem cuffed or you can choose to roll them down for more ankle coverage. These are the ultimate casual-chic jean style—especially when worn with loafers.  Bootcut jeans flare out slightly starting at the knees and are named so because they're often worn with boots, naturally. They typically feature longer pant legs and in these cases, they look best with heeled shoes so the bottoms don't graze the floor.   Aka "Bell Bottoms." This silhouette is similar to bootcut jeans except that the flare is more exaggerated. Popularized in the '70s, the bohemian style is making quite the comeback on the runways and IRL. These Free People ones have an almost perfect 5-star rating and come in 14 shades.  Wish you could combine the comfort of leggings and the structure of jeans? Get yourself some jeggings. They feature soft material and offer TONS of stretch. If you don't like the feeling of stiff, rigid jeans but also don't want to wear leggings 24/7, grab yourself a pair of these babies.  Want to switch up your denim game? Opt for white. The color is more versatile than you think because it's a neutral and while the hue is a spring and summer staple, you can also wear them easily with all your winter white sweaters.  Another neutral on the other side of the spectrum is black. The dark color is great if you're going for an edgier vibe—you really can't go wrong wearing these with a leather moto jacket and black booties. However, they can also be work-appropriate since they're basically one step down from classic black dress pants.  Want denim with a little more oomph? Go all out with bright, colorful denim, like these cute pink ones with great reviews. If you have any other color in mind, odds are you can find it, considering the vast amount of styles on the market.

			 But in a great way!    On Monday, Kourtney Kardashian posted an outfit photo (using a golf course as her background, no less), but since it was at Coachella, this was no ordinary OOTD. She wore a neon-green spandex crop top (or possibly a sports bra) with matching high-waisted bike shorts. She completed her extremely '80s ensemble with white dad sneakers and ankle socks reminiscent of the leg warmer look à la Flashdance. But she also captioned her post "#yeezyseason7," which means that none other than Kanye West is behind her neon two-piece outfit. And this makes sense, considering his affinity for bike shorts – his wife Kim Kardashian modeled a pair from his Season 6 collection in December. She also wore the style on a trip to Tokyo with the whole Kardashian Klan in March.   That Kourt's neon outfit is part of a new Yeezy line comes as no surprise, since the fashion scene as of late has been especially obsessed with '80s nostalgia – Bella Hadid has been wearing scrunchies at Coachella, and, in another fashion throwback, Kendall Jenner posted this pic to Insta in which she's wearing a bucket hat and mom jeans.  Come summertime, get ready to see '80s-inspired looks like Kourtney's everywhere. It's a lot like the athleisure trend that's become popular with off-duty models, celebs, and bloggers, except a whole lot brighter. $10 SHOP NOW $24 SHOP NOW $5 SHOP NOW $75 SHOP NOW Follow Lauren on Instagram. www.cosmopolitan.comhttps’s server IP address could not be found.

			 “Putting this on was a sport in itself.” This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Kim Kardashian is known for many things, one of those things being her incredibly snatched bod. The woman has been wearing tight clothes for years—bodycon dresses, spandex jumpsuits, latex dresses, tight plastic shoes...aka lots of uncomfy-looking items for those of us who aren’t living the luxe Calabasas life. Honestly, it’s a miracle she’s still breathing after that insane Met Gala corset situation.  We already know from her Instagram that Kim works out an insane number of hours every day to get her body the way she wants it to look, but she’s also a huge fan of shapewear on top of it all. So it makes perfect sense that she came out with her own line: Skims Solutionwear. To recap: The line came under fire for its original name, Kimono, but after a name change and redesign, Skims is finally available to purchase. Compared to a lot of other shapewear brands out there, Kim’s line is much more diverse when it comes to  shades and sizes. And the fans are ready!! But here’s the million dollar question: Are the products actually any good? And how do they look on the many different body types of women out there who are not Kim Kardashian? Welp, we decided to put these babies to the test. Cosmo had five women of different shapes and sizes try on four different pieces: the bodysuit, the mid-thigh bodysuit, the bra, and the above-the-knee shorts. At first glance, the pieces are small—like, look like they could fit your old American Girl doll small—so our testers were a bit skeptical, to say the least.  If you’re *any* bit interested in these products, we high-key recommend watching our testers try ’em on for yourself. So sit back and turn that volume up to hear alllll their brutally honest opinions—the good and the bad.

			 "Honestly, I'm really tempted to get a pair." What's the one thing you thought was missing from your festival wardrobe last year? If you answered, "A denim thong," wow, are you in for a treat.  This year Pretty Little Thing sold said product on their site (paired with cowhide chaps) as part of their festival collection. Unforch, they're already sold out, but they were just $21 (or £15). "Dare to wear these fierce denim knickers girl," the website's description says. "Featuring a denim material in a seriously flattering high rise style. Team these with some killer chap trousers and matching bralette for a show-stopping festival outfit that is gonna get you noticed for all of the right reasons."

			 Can someone get me this gorge printed maxi, pls?! This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. Influencer-turned-designer Aimee Song, who boasts a whopping 5.3 million Instagram followers(!), just dropped some brand-new pieces from her label, Song of Style, on Revolve and they are just SO dang cute for fall. The items, including slip dresses, sweaters, and matching sets, feature chic tiger-stripe patterns, orange and deep-red tones, and pops of bright colors like blue and magenta. She’s even got hair scrunchies in matching prints if you really want to commit to coordinating your lewk from head to toe. The prices range from $12 for hair accessories to $248 for more of the fancier designs, but you can use Afterpay to pay off your purchase in monthly increments if you don’t want to drop a ton of money all at once. The sizes also range from XXS to XXL, so the line offers some of the most inclusive sizing on Revolve. I totally want that printed maxi dress with the thigh-high slit seen in the video above, k, thanks. It has what Song calls the "sunburst print," and she told Cosmo that it's a great way to play with color before the end of summer.  Aimee, who debuted her collection in May, teases each drop with gorgeous pics on her Instagram (there’s no better way to market your own clothes than by wearing them, right?). New arrivals appear on Revolve each month, so there are always tons of options to choose from depending on the occasion. Need a cute vacay ’fit? Here’s a fruit-print top for ya. Want a profesh office look? Peep this chic blazer and short set. In the market for a cute but casual vibe? Def splurge on the versatile cozy cardigan. "Sweaters are always a must for me!" said Song, "I wear them year round as an accessory by tying it over my shoulders for the crisp Los Angeles nights and, of course, the A/C in the office."

			 Looking for the perfect pop culture inspiration for Halloween? You're in luck.  There's no shortage of fashion inspiration on the silver screen. Here, 40 of the most iconic outfits from your favorite movie characters.  In Die Another Day, Jinx emerges—in slow-motion—from the ocean in the ultimate Bond-girl outfit: an orange bikini, paired with a knife around the waist, obvi. SHOP A SIMILAR BIKINI I guarantee you've seen someone wearing this as a Halloween outfit since Suicide Squad premiered in 2016. Harley Quinn's fishnet tights, "Daddy's Lil' Monster" T-shirt, bomber jacket, pink and blue hair, and, yeah, a freaking baseball bat just look so badass.   SHOP THE SHIRT The metallic ensemble Rachel wears while performing "Queen of the Night" is such an amazing costume with its beaded neckpiece, silver headpiece, bustier, and fringed skirt. Plus, the songs from this movie are just as powerful today as they were in 1992.  SHOP A SIMILAR NECKLACE Penny Lane's shearling coat in the movie Almost Famous is perhaps just as memorable as the final airplane scene (if you've watched it, you know). Her free-spirited character has a cool, bohemian style and the shaggy, tan coat is a staple throughout the almost three-hour movie.  SHOP A SIMILAR COAT The Great Gatsby's Daisy Buchanan has the chicest 1920s flapper style. In the film, she is often decked out with jeweled headbands, pearls, flashy dresses, and furs, making her a certified style icon—albeit a fictional one.  SHOP A SIMILAR HEADBAND Sure, Elle Woods is a little mortified when she shows up in this bunny costume to what is clearly NOT a costume party—but she definitely makes up for it with an amazing comeback aimed at Vivian. This pink bunny suit serves a pivotal plot point in the movie, helping to motivate her to work even harder at law school. SHOP A SIMILAR BUNNY COSTUME Cecilia Tallis's green dress from Atonement is the epitome of glamour—at least that's what I thought when I first watched it in high school. The bright emerald hue combined with the elegant silhouette made it instantly iconic.   SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS When she first appears on the screen in this red and black skirt set, Torrance cements Rancho Carne High School's status as having the cutest cheerleading uniforms.  SHOP A SIMILAR SKIRT Odds are, if you think of Wednesday Addams, you also picture her go-to dark-pattered white-collared dress—and her signature braided pigtails, naturally. SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Eve made an undoubtedly eye-catching entrance in Life-Size wearing this pink and orange color combination. SHOP A SIMILAR CARDIGAN A superhero's costume is such an integral part of their character, and Wonder Woman's outfit is just as functional as it is stylish. With its armored skirt and bustier in gold, red, and blue, she's protected, has the freedom to kick and punch, and also looks dang good doing it.  SHOP THE COSTUME When everyone and their mother was sporting tiny sunglasses this year, it spawned so many Matrix references—and with good reason. The all-black futuristic outfits, often including patent leather and tiny frames, are just as notable as that one scene when Neo dodges those slow-motion bullets.  SHOP A SIMILAR COAT The white button-down has been a classic piece forever, but Mia Wallace makes it a fashion-forward statement when she wears hers in Pulp Fiction. SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT Halle Berry's version of the conflicted comic book character, in her badass leather bra, gloves, and a slick mask with cat ears, took Catwoman to new levels of sexiness.  SHOP A SIMILAR BRA If you're a fan of prairie dresses, there's no doubt that The Beguiled is right up your alley. The floral-patterned maxis almost steal the focus from the leading actresses in the film—Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning—almost.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS This movie received a lot of hype with good reason—it was a major record-breaking film with a majority of Asian cast members, and the OTT production led to some incredible fashion moments, such as this icy blue tulle gown with floral details.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS Margot's style in The Royal Tenenbaums is still iconic even 17 years after the movie was released. From the fur coat to the Hermès Birkin bag and the single barrette, she has such a signature look. She also makes you want to cut your hair into a bob. Or is that just me?  SHOP A SIMILAR COAT Find a more well-known prom dress than Andie's from Pretty in Pink. I'll wait. Perhaps it's such a distinctive look because she makes it herself in the movie.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS One could argue that Boo from Monsters Inc. was way ahead of the millennial pink curve—from her shirt to her hair ties, she totally pulls off the color. And her oversized outfit only makes her look more adorable and on-trend. SHOP A SIMILAR SHIRT Speaking of the color pink, we all know that The Plastics in Mean Girls have to wear it every Wednesday. The characters, with their cardigans, slogan T-shirts, and velour tracksuits, totally have their finger on the pulse of classic early aughts style.  SHOP THE SHIRT Lisa McDowell's unique pink wedding dress in Coming to America was jaw-dropping because it had a seemingly mile-long train. And her jewelry was spectacularly sparkly, too.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS If you've seen Black Swan you'll recall that the movie is deeply disturbing, and Natalie Portman's convincing portrayal of a professional ballerina gone mad is amazing. The swan costume she wore in her final performance is so on point(e)—the crown, the eye makeup, the tutu—that it's no wonder this look became the one featured on movie posters.  SHOP A SIMILAR CROWN Jenna Rink makes the jump from puberty to adulthood faster than you can say "thirty, flirty, thriving," and is the most lovable, relatable 30-year-old ever. Her first "going out" ensemble consists of neon, stripes, cutout details, and a butterfly necklace, and it is nothing short of amazing—perhaps even better than her "Thriller" dance.  SHOP A SIMILAR NECKLACE Mia really makes the case for Gen-Z yellow  and dances her way into the audience's heart when she wears this bright A-line dress in La La Land.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS  Arguably the most iconic look from a movie might be the yellow raincoats from Singin' in the Rain. It's hard not to think of the bright outerwear when listening to the title song.  SHOP A SIMILAR RAINCOAT This film had the most gorgeous costumes, but it was the bright red ensembles that warriors like Nakia wore that really stole the show. The mix of rich colors, embroidery, and metal armor made these outfits unforgettable.  SHOP A SIMILAR BRACELET No one makes khaki shorts look as good as Dr. Ellie Sattler does in Jurassic Park. I think we can all agree it's very practical for running from velociraptors, which she does basically the entire movie.  SHOP SIMILAR SHORTS Who could forget the first scene when Vivian first appears in Pretty Woman? She wears a cut-out mini dress with thigh-high patent leather boots—talk about making an entrance. Although she gets a makeover later on, it's this first outfit that's the most memorable.  SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS The scene in Gone With the Wind in which Scarlett O'Hara makes a gown out of her own curtains is emotional and impactful, which is why we all remember the look decades later. SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS One of Marilyn Monroe's unforgettable moments in The Seven Year Itch was her dress being blown up by a gust of air from a subway grate. This halter-neck style is practically synonymous with the famous starlet. SHOP A SIMILAR DRESS

			 Grab your sunglasses, these rocks are S-H-I-N-Y.  The unofficial (or maybe even official) perk of being a rich and famous celebrity is having an out-of-this-world gorgeous engagement ring. It just comes with the territory. So whether you’re here because you’re on the hunt for inspiration for your own engagement ring or you simply want to ogle a bunch of huge diamonds, you’re gonna need to make some room on your Pinterest board. Here, the 60 most stunning engagement rings to ever grace Hollywood’s red carpets—from Jennifer Lopez’s 15-carat honker to Katy Perry’s flower-shaped bling. For those who are unaware, Hailey Baldwin and Justin Bieber got engaged after the two rekindled their romance during the summer of 2018 (the pair previously dated in 2015). Her oval-shaped diamond set on a gold band  has an estimated worth of $500,000 and was made in just a couple of weeks.  Jennifer Lawrence’s art dealer husband, Cooke Maroney, chose a classic and sophisticated ring for the actress: A solitary, emerald-cut diamond on a thin band. The couple announced their engagement in February 2019 and tied the knot in Newport, Rhode Island in October 2019. Jennifer Lopez’s rock from fiancé Alex Rodriguez is in a league of its own. The baseball player gave the singer/actress a 15-carat emerald-cut, colorless diamond during a Bahamas beach vacation in March 2019.  Valentine’s Day will never be the same for Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, who got engaged on the holiday in 2019. Bloom popped the question with an oval-shaped ruby featuring diamonds around it to create a flower-shaped halo. The couple took to Instagram to confirm the news in a cheeky pic.  There was no flashy Instagram announcement (that isn’t ScarJo’s style), but the actress confirmed her engagement to Saturday Night Live cast member, Colin Jost, by sporting an 11-carat diamond at Comic Con in May 2019. Casual.  TV writer/actress/Insta personality Erin Foster found her match in entrepreneur Simon Tikhman and announced their engagement on Instagram after a year of dating.  Her ring features a 7-carat oval-cut diamond on a yellow gold band, and is estimated to be worth $300,000. Heidi Klum’s now-husband, guitarist Tom Kaulitz, asked the supermodel to be his wife with a super unique ring during the holidays in 2018—and it worked out. She said “yes” to the green gemstone surrounded by a halo and accented by two cushion-cut diamonds. After welcoming their daughter Banks Violet Blair in October 2018, Hilary Duff and longtime boyfriend, Matthew Koma, got engaged in May 2019. Duff showed off the elongated 3- to 3.5-carat cushion cut sparkler on Instagram. Glee star Lea Michele’s now-husband, Zandy Reich, proposed in 2018 with a sparkling 4-carat rectangular diamond ring surrounded by a pavé halo setting. The couple walked down the aisle together in Napa, California in March 2019. Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt announced their engagement in January 2019. Chris popped the question with an elongated cushion cut engagement ring, and a few months later at their June 2019 wedding, she added a platinum pavé wedding band.  Where does a Bachelor in Paradise bartender pop the question? On a beach in Fiji, duh. Wells Adams proposed to the Modern Family actress with a 5-carat oval-shaped solitary ring by Lorraine Schwartz in June 2019. Emily Ratajkowski is far from your traditional bride (she did get married in a mustard pantsuit at City Hall). And her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard knows it, which is probably why he proposed with a custom ring featuring pear- and square-shaped diamonds on a simple gold band. While vacationing in Finland in November 2018, musician Alexander DeLeon got down on one knee to ask model Josephine Skriver to marry him with a large emerald-cut diamond flanked by two diamond-encrusted bands.  When Eva Longoria’s husband, José “Pepe” Bastón, proposed in Dubai in December 2015, the businessman gave her a stunning ruby and diamond cluster ring.  Natalie Portman’s husband, choreographer Benjamin Millepied, proposed to the Black Swan actress with a 4-carat, round-cut diamond in a halo setting designed by Jamie Wolf. And it was ethically-made too: The stone is an antique, the pavé diamonds are certified as conflict-free, and the platinum? Recycled metal. Victoria Beckham has had 14 engagement rings over the years–yes, you read that right. But the OG sparkler from hubby David Beckham is an elongated marquee-shaped diamond set on a simple gold band.  The royal, who has been dating Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi for almost a year, announced her engagement via the Royal Family Instagram in September. The Princess showed off her solitary diamond in an antique setting in photos taken by her sister, Eugenie.  Princess Eugenie revealed her oval, coral-colored padparadscha sapphire ring during a royal photo call announcing her engagement to longtime boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank, in January 2018. The couple said “I do” in Windsor Chapel in October of the same year and exchanged traditional Welsh gold bands. Adam Shulman proposed to actress Anne Hathaway with an elongated emerald-cut diamond set in a pavé band. The Academy-Award winner has since added a platinum band to her ring finger since tying the knot in 2012.  Gina Rodriguez announced her engagement to actor Joe LoCicero in August 2018 when she wished him a happy birthday on Instagram. The pair first met in 2016 when LoCicero appeared on Jane the Virgin. Her ring is an art deco–inspired design featuring one large diamond.  Karlie Kloss and Josh Kushner tied the knot in October 2018, and when the pair became engaged in July she showed off her square-cut ring with a diamond band on Instagram stories and Twitter. The couple dated for six years before the announcement.  Lady Gaga’s pink sapphire ring is valued at $400,000. She confirmed her engagement to her agent Christian Carino in October 2018, but the two called it off in early 2019—we wonder if she got to keep the bling?  Priyanka Chopra and the youngest Jonas brother, Nick, started dating in May 2018 and in August the duo confirmed their engagement on Instagram. Apparently, Chopra is a huge fan of Tiffany & Co., so Jonas shut down a whole store to in London to find the right ring.  Kelvin Hayden popped the question to Taraji P. Henson in May 2018 with a ring that featured a round diamond and a gorgeous rose-gold band.  Gwyneth Paltrow and her Glee and American Horror Story co-creator husband, Brad Falchuk, began dating in 2014 and confirmed their engagement on the cover of Goop Magazine’s sex & love issue in January 2018. She was spotted wearing her gorgeous blue round-cut engagement ring at the Producers Guild Awards that same month.  Paris Hilton and actor  Chris Zylka kicked off the New Year with an engagement, which they announced on Instagram. Zylka popped the question atop a snowy slope in Aspen, Colorado with a 20-carat rock worth an estimated $2 million. However, less than a year later the pair called it quits. Meghan Trainor and her Spy Kids husband Daryl Sabara had been dating for a year when the actor proposed to Meghan in December 2017. He asked her with a round-cut ring under Christmas lights, and her family adorably caught it all on video.  Maria Menounos and her partner of 20 years, Keven Undergaro, rang in 2018 by marrying on live television during Fox’s New Year’s Eve with Steve Harvey broadcast in Times Square. The couple became engaged in 2016 when Undergaro proposed to her on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show with a custom-made, round-cut sparkler by jeweler Jean Dousset.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle almost broke the internet when they announced their engagement in November 2017 after dating for more than a year. Her ring features a cushion-cut stone flanked by two diamonds, reportedly from Princess Diana’s personal jewelry collection.  Kaley Cuoco’s equestrian husband Karl Cook popped the question in late November 2017—on her 32nd birthday!—and posted her adorable reaction to Instagram. The couple had been dating for two years after meeting at a horse show, and Cook picked out a pear-cut engagement ring  by Nadis Diamonds for the romantic evening.

			 Some of these are WILD. What piece of jewelry was all the rage the year you were born? Find out by scrolling through this list—there are some REAL blasts from the pasts in here, BTW. 1985 was all about geometric accessories, so these triangle-shaped earrings that Diana Ross wears here would have been all the rage.  The mid-'80s were rife with huge-ass bling, and this trend, which basically meant that you tack a bunch of stuff onto an earring thread and call it a day, was part of that! Here, Jean Kasem demonstrates the everything-in-tassel-form trend (and many other '80s fashion trends, obviously). Why even wear chandelier earrings if you can't see them from space? That was the general motto in 1987, and Oprah obviously followed suit. Everyone wanted to wear hoops in the '80s and the bigger, the better. Vanessa Williams definitely got the hang of the style here. Moon and star symbols were super prominent in the late '80s and so were mismatched earring styles. Jane Fonda represents both trends with aplomb here, right? Though headbands aren't technically jewelry, designs with gold chains and rhinestones certainly made them feel like they were in 1990, as Madonna's look so clearly indicates. As Heather Locklear illustrates here, dangly earrings with pom poms or large beads were a pretty big deal in 1991. In 1992 a belt wasn't just a run-of-the-mill accessory—it was a piece of jewelry just like a necklace or earring. Tyra Banks demonstrates the trend perfectly during a Chanel runway show here. Lace chokers—as well as those wirey black tattoo chokers—had a major moment in 1993, as evidenced by Cindy Crawford here. In 1994, the chokers took up basically your whole neck, as seen in this particularly OTT crystal piece on Naomi Campbell. The matching shades are a nice touch, no? Intricately designed thick diamond or crystal bracelets, like the one Gwyneth Paltrow's wearing here, were a major accessory trend in 1995.  It was totally common to wear a completely matching set of earrings and necklaces, especially chokers, back in 1996. Here, Nicole Kidman demonstrates the idea. In 1997, people were all about that classic diamond stud. Here, Sarah Jessica Parker models the style with an also '90s-appropriate high-crown updo (more of those to come in the following slides, too).  Chokers were clearly a major part of all '90s fashion, so it's no shocker that Jennifer Aniston—and pretty much everyone else—doubled up sparkly diamond/crystal/rhinestone ones like these by 1998. Classic earrings in the form of precious stone studs had a nice time in the spotlight in 1999. Here, Lucy Liu wears a ruby pair. Cuffs—huge bracelets that almost look like Wonder Woman's wrist armor— showed up everywhere in 2000, especially in Paris Hilton's wardrobe. Everyone wore statement bracelets with big beads and bright colors in 2001, including Cameron Diaz. As demonstrated by Drew Barrymore here, large, round pearl earrings were in everyone's jewelry box back in 2002. Instead of the regular hoop style, which is vertical, circle earrings like the ones on Lucy Liu here, which were more horizontal, had a moment in 2003. Lariat necklaces—the ones that come together and form one cascading line down the decolletage—were ultra popular in 2004, as evidenced by Lindsay Lohan's piece. Sparkly dangling earrings in one column (as opposed to major chandelier styles that spread out) had a nice resurgence in 2005. Here, Mischa Barton wears a pair. Necklaces you could drape over blouses and sweaters, and potentially loop a couple times around your neck, were a big deal back in 2006. Here, Blake Lively shows off the trend. A lot of jewelry in 2007 was inspired by the military and, specifically, dog tags. Leighton Meester models a simple necklace version here. Many gravitated toward super sparkly dangly earrings, like this helix pair Beyonce's modeling, in 2008. Huge-ass studs, like the ones pictured on Jennifer Lopez here, were a force to be reckoned with in 2009. Statement jewelry was major in 2010, culminating in a ton of necklaces with metallic fringe, like the one on Kim Kardashian, here.  Rings with intricate metalwork, larger stones, and gunmetal finishes dominated the scene in 2011, demonstrated here by Ke$ha. Lots of folks were down to pierce the little middle notch in their ears called a "tragus" in 2012. Scarlett Johansson has one! In 2013, people liked the longer necklace look, and almost everyone had one with an edgy (faux) fang tooth at the end. Here, Kerry Washington shows off the look. Cross-styled rings and bracelets adorned the wrists and fingers of all the trendsetters in 2014—including Jessica Alba, pictured here with a whole ring and bracelet party of Xes.

			 The only good thing about August is all the shopping deals, TBH.  Welp, can you believe it? Summer's already ending, folks. While it's a sad moment for those who love warm weather, there's also a silver lining in the form of all those sweet, sweet online shopping deals. Revolve's August sale has items at up to 65 percent off, so browse away and snag all the best summer buys before the month is over at super discounted rates.  You've always wanted a crochet top to wear to the beach, and, at this price, it's an opportunity you can't pass up.   Whether you're a fan of peaches or not, we can all agree this tiny stud earring is SO cute.  Bra tops are definitely happening, so why not embrace the trend with a yellow one featuring pineapples? Matching pants encouraged but not required.  A denim jacket is a wardrobe essential, and an oversized one is the perfect transitional piece. Wear it over your floral dresses on summer nights, and, come fall, layer it over all your colorful sweaters and chinky knits.  A shoe with a block heel that's easy to slip on will change your life—it's comfortable enough to wear all day, and so convenient to throw on when you're in a hurry.  You'll receive so many compliments on a stunning pair of opalite studs that you'll never want to wear any other earrings.  A skirt that's light enough to wear in hot weather in a pattern totally perfect for autumn. Pair it with sandals or boots.  There's no time like a sale to get yourself a new iPhone case that's as eye-catching as you are.  A floral top in pastel yellow is super sweet, while the asymmetrical cut and gathered detailing make it stand out from all your other shirts.   Ditch your classic black and tortoiseshell sunnies in favor of a bright pair that will definitely catch people's attention.  If you're not done with swimwear shopping, you'll want to add a one-shoulder marigold bikini top with a scalloped hem straight to your cart. Pair it with the matching bottoms for a bomb swim look the next time you hit the beach.  Dress up your fingers with a set gold stacked rings with triangle details and colored crystals.  A pair of cutoff denim shorts are made even edgier with zipper details on each side.  A polka dot dress is undoubtedly sweet, but when it features sheer fabric and a cutout and it's also V flirty.  A small straw tote is a bag you can take with you to the beach or while running errands—it's roomy enough to fit all the essentials, and small enough that it's easy to carry.  If you're a fan of shoulder ties and floral prints, look no further than a strappy top; the silk fabric will make you feel like you're wearing a pajama shirt in the best way.  Indulge your sweater addiction and buy one in the prettiest shade of dusty rose—once you feel how amazingly soft the cashmere is, there's no going back. Odds are your other flats are all worn out, so get brand-new ones that you know you'll wear with everything, like a pair of slingbacks in white.  Not ready to stop wearing breezy, summer jumpsuits? Me neither. Shop a blue patterned one with a low neckline and tie in the back so you can wear it the rest of the warm-weather season.  If you're someone who doesn't necessarily believe in the saying "less is more," opt for a gold choker necklace with 11 different charms.

"Can you imagine what that would do for our world? We all have unique stories; we are just different, and we have every right to be. We just want to be represented, and maybe they will want to represent us too." Follow Rachel on Twitter and Instagram.

			 Gotta say, 2011 was a wild year for Kourtney. Kourtney Kardashian has changed a lot since Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered in October 2007. Scroll on to trace her style journey from unknown reality star to mega A-lister, with special appearances by a lot of animal print and head-to-toe leather looks. Love Cosmo? Want the mag? Subscribe here! OMG, bb Kardashians! Before Kourt was one of the biggest reality TV stars in the world, she was just a normal teen wearing a '90s classic: the camisole.  Five years before Keeping Up With the Kardashians premiered on E!, Kourtney hit up a fashion show afterparty in L.A. wearing a semi-sheer tank, black pinstripe pants, and a logo bag.  Believe it or not, KUWTK wasn't Kourtney's first reality show. She previously appeared on Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, which was a show where privileged kids had to work on a cattle ranch. Here she is with her co-star, Robert Blake, wearing a terracotta tank and a blue sequined blouse. Kourt went for an all-black ensemble for this event in 2006. She paired a pinstripe blazer with a pleated miniskirt, knee-high boots and a leather bag, and topped the look off with some chunky necklaces. Please enjoy this photo of Kourtney, Kim, and Lindsay Lohan breaking it down on the dance floor together at the Playstation 3 launch party. Wasn't 2006 fun? Just ahead of the show's premiere, Kourtney wore this hot-pink bubble-hem piece, paired with gold earrings and heels, to a men's fashion show in L.A. Later that month, at a Vegas party hosted by her sister, Kim, she wore this green and black dress that had a mesh modesty panel, pairing it with a black clutch and silver heels. The day where it all started...Kourtney showed up to the premiere party of Keeping Up with the Kardashians wearing a shiny polka dot dress, peep-toe pumps and a gold clutch. Kourt showed up to Kim's birthday party in L.A. wearing this white kimono dress with a plunging neckline, accessorizing with a studded clutch and black strappy shoes. For the grand opening of a Hollywood sushi joint, Kourtney kept it casual in a pair of flared, light-wash jeans and a neutral silk blouse. Silk and flares were kind of her thing, actually. Not long after that, she was spotted in L.A. wearing this lilac and lace cami, paired with dark-wash bell-bottoms and bug-eye sunnies. By the next month, Kourtney was into wearing statement dresses. Check her out in at a Las Vegas event in this purple ombré fringe mini, which she wore with black platform Mary Janes and a gold bracelet. The following year, she was still at it with an eye-catching patterned sheath, paired with an even more attention-grabbing oversize fold-over clutch. Kourtney stepped off a jet in a patterned blazer dress with a large black belt and coordinating heels, which she accessorized with a gold Louis Vuitton handbag. Pregnant with her first child, Mason, Kourtney chose a form-fitting olive sheath, black pumps, and a statement gold necklace for the launch of Rich Soil's clothing collection at then-popular store Kitson in L.A. The new mom made an appearance at an event in NYC wearing this head-to-toe leather look with super strappy heels. At a QVC event in New York, Kourtney worked the wide-leg pants trend in a pair of black trousers worn with an olive tank and a gold belt. It's here where Kourtney's style journey enters a wild phase. At a Las Vegas nightclub appearance, Kourtney wore this blush mini with a popping feather collar, a quilted clutch, and black pumps. See what I mean by wild? Kourtney was way into animal print at this point in her life. She wore these leopard-print pants with a black cardigan, coordinating pumps, and a teal necklace at a Victoria's Secret Fashion Week event in NYC. The next month, Kourtney attended a Dollhouse book signing in L.A. with her sister Khloé, wearing a white blouse, a red skirt with suspenders, and these very distracting houndstooth tights. The next year, while pregnant with her second child, Penelope, she attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party in West Hollywood in a much more simple look. She wore this flowing white gown with gold trim and accessorized with blingy gold bracelets, earrings, and a coordinating clutch. Now a mother of two, Kourtney was spotted out and about in NYC wearing this polka-dot blouse, a black skater skirt, and a leather belt bag. At the following year's Elton John Oscars viewing party, Kourtney went bold in this red floral ballgown, which she paired with black shoes and a simple gold bracelet. While celebrating then-boyfriend Scott Disick's 30th birthday in Las Vegas, Kourtney (with a fresh set of bangs) showed up in this blue lace top and very funky feathered skirt. She hopped on the cape-dress trend at an L.A. launch party for watch company Audemars Piguet in this hot pink number, which she styled with a black clutch and heels and a gold necklace. Kourt wore her hair slicked back a la Kris for a charity benefit in NYC. If the hair wasn't enough, her white three-piece suit seemed to be directly inspired by the matriarch of the Kardashian clan. That same month, Kourtney stepped out in NYC wearing this chevron-patterned fur coat, leather leggings, and a black turtleneck. Kourtney once again attended Elton John's annual Oscars viewing party in L.A., this time pulling off another Kris Jenner look with aplomb (the pussy bow with a white button-down shirt). Kourtney was spotted out and about in NYC wearing a printed button-down, slate-colored silk shorts, and a pink duster, which she paired with neutral heels. Hey, mama! While pregnant with her third child, Reign, Kourtney slipped into this bump-hugging lace catsuit, which she accessorized with a metallic clutch, at a party in the Hamptons.

			 Following the designer's suicide on Tuesday, the brand wrote that she'll "remain in our hearts forever."  Frances Valentine, the accessory line launched by the late Kate Spade in 2015, paid tribute to its founder with a touching Instagram post on Wednesday, which showed an elegant black-and-white photo of Spade looking away from the camera. The caption reads:  Spade was found dead of an apparent suicide in her Manhattan apartment in New York City on Tuesday, June 5, but is survived by her husband and business partner Andy, and their 13-year-old daughter, Frances (whom Frances Valentine was, in part, named after).  Spade founded her eponymous label in 1993 but left the company in 2006, after selling her stake in the brand to Neiman Marcus, in part to raise her daughter. After almost a decade-long hiatus, she returned to the fashion fold with the launch of Frances Valentine, which focused mainly on handbags and shoes.  In an interview with Business of Fashion, Spade explained, “Frances is a longtime family name on my dad’s side. My grandfather, father, brother and my daughter’s name is Frances. And then Valentine was my mom’s dad’s middle name because he was born on Valentine’s Day.”  After the news broke, many celebrities, fashion insiders, and women on Twitter offered their condolences and reminisced about their first Kate Spade bag. Frances Valentine's post was just the latest tribute after the Kate Spade Instagram account reacted to her passing, as well as an emotional statement her husband Andy gave to The New York Times. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

			 Mmmmm, knits. My friends, it is time to recognize a very superior loungewear item that is both polished/put-together and comfy as heck. Of course I’m talking to you about knit sets, which are sweaters, but for your entire body.  These matching two-piece looks consist of a top and skirt, a top and pants, or a dress and cardigan and they’re just as cozy as your fave pair of pajamas or your go-to athleisure style. They’re typically monochrome or coordinated in some other way with patterns and colors. What’s so great about ’em apart from their softness and general vibe? Obviously the fact that they’re three looks in one. You can wear them together, wear just the top, or just the bottom and be super chic and cute. Oh, this old thing? Just threw it on! 
  Anyway, these bbs have been popping up all over, on your fave street style stars, celebs, and all over your fave e-retail sites.  See how effortless, yet comfy, yet sleek they are? I can’t wait to cuddle up on my next movie-night date in one of these or go to work and be comfy all day or do literally anything and look just really good but feel so hygge. Do you want to do all those things too? Fabulous! Let’s shop together.

			 BRB, never taking these off. Everlane is a clothing brand known for making incredible, high-quality, and comfy basics. They’ve got your staple jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, bags—basically anything you need for a solid wardrobe. The only thing that’s been missing: sneakers. That is, until today, because Everlane just launched their first sneaker line called Tread by Everlane. The trendy leather sneakers come in seven different colors, including neutrals like gray, white, and black, along with fun pink and yellow hues. The sneakers are totally unisex, available in men’s sizes 7–13 and women’s sizes 5–12. What’s more, these ring in at a pretty sweet price tag: just $98 for a pair.  And like the rest of the brand’s clothing and accessories, these shoes are designed to last.  According to their press release, Everlane devotees have been asking “When are you going to launch a sneaker?” for years. But the brand didn’t want to release just any sneaker—they wanted to create something as sustainable as it is stylish. Their solution: the Tread, which is made from leather produced in the “world's cleanest tannery.”  The brand claims it’s the “lowest impact” shoe of its kind, using less waste, less energy, and 54 percent less virgin plastic. And for any waste they couldn’t eliminate on their own, Everlane teamed up with two third-party firms to “measure the Trainer’s carbon footprint and offset 100% of those emissions,” reads the press release.  So if you’re in the market for a durable, fashionable shoe that’s also good for the Earth, Everlane has you covered.

			 His show was a powerful celebration of women.  #MeToo founder Tarana Burke sat in the front row at Prabal Gurung's Fall 2018 runway show during New York Fashion Week on Sunday night. Gurung is known for expressing powerful statements — his collection in February 2017 included slogan T-shirts reading, "The Future is Female" and "This is What a Feminist Looks Like" — so Burke was an obvious choice for the designer to invite to his show, which once again celebrated strong women.  Backstage, the models were surrounded by signs that read, "You the present / You are the future / You rule the world / Walk with intention." For the show's finale, they walked out on the runway carrying white roses in a statement of female solidarity.   Our opening act. A moment backstage with #pgmuse @gigihadid 💖. 📸 @kylarae_  #pgworld #femininitywithabite #beautywithsubstance #pgnyfw #nyfw #gigihadid A post shared by  Prabal Gurung (@prabalgurung) on Feb 11, 2018 at 7:05pm PST  Le grand finale.  This is the #pgworld, where we celebrate female solidarity, we share the colours of Prabal’s home in the east, and we present a vision for our collective future, a future that is #StrongerInColour. 📸 @voguerunway  Sand Mandala paintings and set design by artist @joemangrum 💐 @central_park_flowers  #pgworld #pgnyfw #femininitywithabite #nyfw A post shared by  Prabal Gurung (@prabalgurung) on Feb 11, 2018 at 8:19pm PST In an interview with WWD, Burke said she has no plans on attending any other fashion shows, but that it was important to show support for Gurung because “he’s shown a real interest and desire to amplify the voices of women and women’s issues. He has a real connection to what’s happening in the world around women.”  Gurung, who was raised by a single mother in Nepal, said his collection was inspired by the matriarchal Mosuo tribe of China and India’s women-led Gulabi Gang, who are known for their pink saris and defending other women.  “Where I am from," he said in an interview with The New York Times, "color can be a show of strength, as well."  Huma Abedin and transgender rights activist Janet Mock were also seated in the front row next to Burke. Other celebs in attendance included Olivia Palermo and Cardi B. Burke's last big event was attending the Golden Globes with Michelle Williams in January, when she was invited with other women's rights activists and wore a black dress to stand with the #MeToo movement.

			 This might be the most jaw-dropping one yet! Khloé Kardashian has grown up in the spotlight, meaning that a lot of photos are out there documenting her style transformation. Click through to see all the looks Khloé’s worn over the years. 22-year-old Khloé shows up to the pink-carpet premiere of House Bunny in a fitted white mini and black peep-toe heels. She keeps her chestnut-colored hair in loose waves and completes the look with a thin black belt around her waist.  More than a year later, she switches her hair color in favor of a darker tone and sweeps it up in a casual updo. She attends Motorola’s 9th Annual Anniversary Party in Los Angeles wearing a one-shoulder dress with a very large floral detail and peep-toe slingbacks.  One month later, she’s spotted in South Beach, Miami, wearing a gold sequin dress and silver sandals. But if you’re in Miami, an OTT, glittery ensemble is basically a necessity.  In an unexpectedly casual outfit, Khloé wears wide-leg jeans, Converse, a green top, and a drapey duster to attend a celebrity event benefiting the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in Los Angeles. This outfit, especially with the extremely large sunglasses perched atop her head, is the epitome of 2008 L.A.  Khloé attends a clambake (not kidding) in Malibu wearing a brown crochet maxi dress and Fendi logo purse. The handbag is a great example of trends making a comeback—10 years later, the logo print is so in. A couple months later, she hits the catwalk at the  Dash & Smooch Spring 2009 fashion show during New York Fashion Week wearing a striped bustier top, leather jacket, black tube skirt, and strappy heels.  LOL, remember slide phones? Toward the end of 2008, Khloé makes an appearance at a T-Mobile event in New York City to celebrate the launch of its new G1 model. She poses with the phone and wears a multicolor maxi with a handkerchief hem and a leather jacket. She’s then spotted in December blowing kisses at the camera at Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz’s New Year’s Eve party at Las Vegas’ PURE Nightclub in a metallic minidress with patent-leather neutral pumps.  In true sportsmanlike fashion, she wears a blue DirecTV jersey to its third annual Celebrity Beach Bowl in St. Petersburg, Florida. Are you even ready to play football if you’re not rocking some striped knee-length crew socks? And she goes all out for a themed party! Here, she attends a Pepsi throwback party at World on Wheels in Los Angeles wearing bright-blue leg warmers, leggings, and a yellow headband.  Making her appearance rounds in Vegas, she attended a grand opening party of Sapphire Pool in the city donning a black strapless dress with pink accents and black sandals. She also styled her hair in a curlier-than-usual look. In a casual jet-setter outfit, Khloé gets off a plane in Miami in her best Inspector-Gadget-on-vacation outfit, which includes a black beach hat, sunnies, a Louis Vuitton carry-on bag, and a belted khaki trench dress. With then-boyfriend Lamar Odom, she keeps it simple in a black sheath dress and platform pumps with her hair worn down in textured waves. The pair married the same month.  She then makes an appearance at Rachel Pally’s pop-up boutique in Los Angeles in a black-and-white maxi wrap dress. Inexplicably wearing a furry hat complete with ears and paws, she arrives at Dash’s Soho store in New York City. Hey, at least she’s warm.  Khloé definitely stands out at the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in this eye-catching courtside outfit, complete with cheetah-print pants, a sheer black top, and strappy black heels.  Khloé strays from her usual black and neutral color palettes and pops in this bright-pink V-neck dress while shopping at Vera Wang in West Hollywood.  She’s a big fan of animal prints. At the Teen Choice Awards, she wears a gray leopard-print dress with a leg slit and long sleeves.  In a more casual street-style outfit, Khlo is seen on the streets of New York City in a baseball cap, neon purse, and black Christian Louboutin lace-up boots.   Back to her animal-print roots, Khlo wears these eye-catching stilettos with a simple navy dress.  At The Today Show, she chooses an extremely colorful outfit consisting of a multicolor sleeveless dress and matching neon-orange accessories. Khloé also debuts a lighter hair color, keeping it sleek and straight.  She shows up to the HPNOTIQ Glam Louder Program launch event in Beverly Hills wearing a fun orange-and-white striped midi dress with statement white heels.  Khloé arrives to the Kardashian Kollection (RIP) cocktail party in a bold floral dress with mesh sleeves and black pumps.  Back in Vegas—this time, for the opening of the now-closed Kardashian Khaos store in the Mirage Hotel—Khloé poses in a matching striped set with printed heels. She adds to her look with a dramatic red lip and an exaggerated side part.  And speaking of dramatic, she goes full-on glam a couple months later at  Elton John’s Oscars viewing party wearing a velvet gown with a plunging neckline and silver jewelry.  Toward the end of the year, she’s spotted at a DreamWorks event in medium-wash skinnies, a tan jacket, and neutral heels.  Khlo definitely makes an ARRIVAL at Watch What Happens Live! in this figure-hugging metallic catsuit with black heels. It very closely resembles the infamous catsuit Bella Hadid wears to the Met Gala one year later. Khloé attends Kanye West’s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show at Madison Square Garden in New York City wearing a pink full-length coat and tight beige bodysuit codesigned by Balmain’s creative director  Olivier Rousteing and West. The entire Kardashian-Jenner fam wears custom looks to the runway show.  For Scott Disick’s 33rd birthday bash at 1OAK in Las Vegas, Khlo pulls out all the stops in this Barbie-esque pink latex dress by House of CB. She styles her now-blonde hair in effortless waves.  She’s basically glowing in this bright-orange midi at the launch of House of CB’s flagship store in West Hollywood. She wears minimal  accessories, like neutral pumps and subtle gold jewelry, to really let her dress stand out.

			 Oh, this boot is goooood. Does fall even begin before you buy a new pair of boots? Answer: No. The crisp autumn air requires indulging in a much-needed set of booties. While a sugary, pumpkin-flavored latte can be found on every corner, a good boot is hard to find. Everlane, the San Francisco–based clothing brand, is known for designing for all your practical needs, from chic work bags that actually fit your laptop to vintage mom jeans made for childless adults and moms alike. Today, it launched the perfect ankle boot.  They’re called the Editor Boot, and as an actual editor, I feel it is aptly named. Everlane designed the Goldilocks of ankle boots, with subtle nods to high-fashion details that don’t overpower its simple silhouette. It’s thoroughly modern yet absolutely timeless. Here, I’m breaking down all the reasons this shoe is your new must-have.   Some designers go super hard on the pointy toe, coming close to some sort of hybrid between clown shoes and wearing your mother’s heels as a child. These are not too large nor too small—they’re just right and super on-trend.    The kitten heel is a delicate shape and reads more elegant than a block heel. The 1-inch height is comfortable enough to commute on the train to work, but your heel/arch/footbed will be pain-free by the time you get to happy hour.  Some brands place a kitten heel in the middle, which can give the style a witchy vibe. I’m not against a Salem shoe, but Everlane’s style feels more Copenhagen Fashion Week than Salem, Massachusetts, circa 1692. Because the Editor’s heel is situated toward the back of the shoe, it is refreshingly modern.   Too tall a boot shaft, and your jeans awkwardly scrunch on top. Too short, and you’re baring an ankle like a Victorian harlot. Here we have the golden ratio of ankle-boot-to-denim-jeans: This boot hits right above your Achilles’ heel and delicately kisses the top of your skinny jeans. Perfection. Alongside the rest of Everlane’s heeled footwear collection, the Editor Boot is handcrafted in a small, family-owned factory in Val D’Arno, Italy. It comes in three colors: buttery black, bone white, and a chocolate brown suede, all for $225. If the price seems steep, think of all the future PSLs you can now buy, because you’ll wear these boots for a lifetime.

			 Also, your feet will love how comfy these are. Just sayin’.  While sky-high heels are losing their status as the It Shoe, the humble sneaker is definitely picking up momentum in their place. Why? Whether you’re all about that athleisure life or you simply want to be comfortable, you can wear ’em for hours on end and they go with so many outfits. Here, 20 fashionable sneaker brands that’ll make your feet so, so happy.  Don’t knock Dr. Scholl’s. Yes, the shoes have memory foam insoles, but they’re anything but orthopedic-looking—just look at these cute perforated slip-ons! Odds are, you’ve seen tons of people wearing FILA’s Disruptor sneakers, and that’s because they are super padded and have a thick sole that cushions each step. The brand’s kicks definitely have an edgy streetwear aesthetic, and the same rings true with its clothing. Soludos is known for its beachy-looking smoking slippers, sandals, and espadrilles, but it also has cute sneaks, like this embroidered rainbow pair that’s perfect for summer. The brand’s name is a nod to the fact that there’s no new plastic in any of its shoes. All designs are made with 100 percent recycled post-consumer plastic. Impressive, right? It has low-tops and high-tops in a variety of shades with a simple logo on the tongue. While Vans is synonymous with skate culture, it doesn’t mean you have to know how to pop an ollie to wear them. The checkerboard pattern, seen on these slip-ons, is a signature of the brand, and its Old Skool style with white contrast striping is a widely known silhouette great for everyday wear too. White Converse high-tops made a huge comeback circa 2016 and continue to be popular today. Both high and low styles from the brand come in an array of colors, so you can pick your favorite (or even multiple!) to wear with any outfit. Consider Saucony if you’re looking for a more retro shoe. Its vintage-y styles make for a fashionable look, while the durable rubber sole and cushioning are great for activewear. And if you need more of a traditional running shoe, the brand also offers sleeker designs with shock-absorbing features. From the brand’s Samba style (pictured here) to its recognizable Stan Smiths, Adidas has no shortage of trendy “fashion” sneakers in addition to its traditional running and workout shoes. The iconic designs look just as good with a pair of jeans as they do with leggings. The brand launched its minimal-looking sneakers in 2013 and specializes in low-top shoes featuring perforated leather, patent leather, suede, and knit material. Greats’ best-selling silhouette is the Royale, seen here and available in a range of hues. This Brazilian-based sustainable brand has been around since 2004, and Meghan Markle also happens to be a fan. “Veja,” in Portuguese, means “look,” (which you don’t have to tell me twice—these tricolored kicks totally stand out). The popular V10, shown here, and Esplar silhouettes totally have a sporty ’90s aesthetic if that’s what you’re looking for. You may have seen Cariuma on your Instagram feed, and that’s because influencers can’t get enough of the Brazilian brand—Grown-ish’s Luka Sabbat often wears them. To simplify the selection process, it makes only four core styles (two low-tops and two high-tops) but offers them in various fabrics and colors. If you love the comfortability of sneakers but want a range of styles, Tretorn might be the brand for you. It has everything from these retro-looking two-tone ones to leopard-print, gingham, and sequined designs. The brand launched in 2016 and immediately blew up thanks to its sustainable vision and because Time Magazine dubbed it “the world’s most comfortable shoes.” Allbirds’ most popular styles are the wool runners (shown here) and the tree runners, named for the materials from which they’re made. While Puma is known for its athletic wear and sports shoes, it’s also a great go-to if you’re in the market for trendy kicks—take, for instance, these suede monochromatic ones. Rihanna’s Fenty Puma collection helped solidify the creeper as an It Shoe, and the brand also offers velvet and metallic designs for a luxe vibe. The brand’s handcrafted sneakers are made in Italy, and while its classic Capri low-tops (pictured here) are one of its core styles, it also offers high-tops, trendy thick-soled shoes, platforms, and slides. Superga’s 2750 Cotu canvas style, seen here, is one of Kate Middleton’s go-to shoes and has an impressive array of sneakers from platforms to espadrilles to slides. Plus, the range of colors ensures you can pair them with practically any outfit. Name a more immediately recognizable brand, I’ll wait. Keds has been making canvas shoes since 1916—Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Yoko Ono all wore them. I mean, even my grandma has been wearing the signature white pair since I was born. They’re undoubtedly timeless thanks to their iconic low-top silhouette. Nike’s fashion sneakers are perfect for double duty—their lightweight cushioning makes them great for the gym, but they also transition to everyday life, whether you’re running errands post-workout or you simply want to complete your street-style ensemble. The brand’s Air Max 97 style, seen here, is one of the most popular among women with its ripple-like lines and functional hidden laces. If you’re into super-simplistic sneakers that aren’t completely boring, opt for a pair of Common Projects. The brand gained a cultlike following when it launched in 2004—Drake, Nick Jonas, and Jennifer Aniston all have sported pairs, which feature gold-stamped numbers that represent the article number, size, and color. Yes, Golden Goose kicks are an investment. But the slightly worn-in look and its signature star details set them apart from the pack. If you find yourself trying to scuff new sneakers to make them look more distressed (guilty), consider this brand that already does it for you. How convenient!

			 It’s harder than you may think! Hair bows. We haven’t talked about ’em since our childhood days. Late last year, though, people like Kate Middleton started wearing them, and now they’re back. But, like, how do you wear them without looking like a child...or a cheerleader?  I gotchu.   When in doubt, go for velvet. This seems to be the most universally acceptable hair-bow material. When velvet is out of season or you just can’t find it, something with a cool pattern or texture is an okay replacement.   Wear it lower, not higher.* The higher you wear a bow on your head, the more likely you are to be chanting “Be aggressive, B-E aggressive....”—this has been scientifically proven. SO, with that in mind, stick that thing on the lower half of your skull—the closer to the nape of your neck, the better. Keep the strings of the bow longer than the loops, my fren. This is just a pretty look that makes bouncy ponytails seem even BOUNCIER.  ...UNLESS you’re going for *drama*. Then it’s ALL about the loops. I said what I said. Use one that’s connected to a scrunchie.   Bows are in. Scrunchies are in. You can’t go wrong here. *This is also the one exception to the rule of not wearing high bows. Now that you’re armed with all the info you need, get out there and live your best bow-wearing life!

			 These are the ones actually worth that subscription. Is it just me, or are people now carrying around those navy Rent the Runway return bags like they’re actual accessories? And it’s not just RTR that’s everywhere. Fashion rental services are clogging up my feeds, offering free trials, discounts, and exclusive labels, and…let’s just say, sorting through them is a liiittle bit overwhelming. Like, some sites want you to create an account before you even browse the selection (no thank you?), while others offer only one brand (hard pass, it’s called variety, look it up).  Still, since the general idea is clearly genius, I volunteered to go down an internet black hole and test-drive each one. Yeah, it’s hard work, but somebody’s gotta wear sequins on a Monday.  Listen up if you fancy: This site carries only luxury designers, which, yes, $$. But it’s kinda worth it to feel like you’re having a true red-carpet moment. Anyone whose life goal is to end up in a “Who wore it better?” side-by-side with Meghan Markle will drool over the puff-sleeve Rodarte gowns and Missoni minidresses. Armarium can also hook you up with a legit celeb stylist for a phone consult. (Suggestion: Pour a glass of bubbly while you take the call.) You know how half your closet is made up of stuff from Free People, Urban, and Anthro? This site is the brainchild of their parent company, so I obviously love it. Renting felt like sampling the next-season version of my own wardrobe. I borrowed pieces I probs would have bought but now don’t have to. They also stock vintage clothes, which feels a ­little more special. Your dream purse is calling! Bag Romance loans the kind of purses people spend a lifetime saving up for. Yes, like Chanel. Prices vary—this Charlotte Elizabeth top-handle (appears throughout) is $140 for a week or $200 for a month.  Quick gripe first: You get only three things at a time and have to send them all back before you receive your next set. But…for the price? Worth it. I love their non-boring staples, like this Modcloth top with fun piping that I wore to work, plus silky midis and jackets for those weirdly too-cold days between fall and winter.  The OG rental company is a classic for a reason: Its selection is killer, from flowy pieces like this Reformation number to normally $1,500 boss-bitch Derek Lam shifts (plus ­jewelry and bags). Since it’s so popular, you do risk renting the same look as your bestie or coworker (been there). My solution: shopping the “new arrivals” drop every Saturday a.m. They’re so fresh that they’ll often arrive with the price tags still intact.

			 Business in the front, party also in the front.  On Monday, Kim Kardashian  attended the inaugural Business of Fashion West Coast Summit in Century City, California, wearing an interesting maxi shirtdress with a plunging neckline, and WOW, was it something.    The dress was a hybrid of a  full-length column skirt and a button-down, but Kim K. wore it without a bra because that's just her style! She really emphasized the plunging neckline with a long gold chain and pendant. During the event she spoke with BoF's editor-in-chief, Imran Amed, along with her mom, Kris Jenner, to discuss starting and running a business.    Since the BoF event was held at Westfield Century City — the same shopping mall in which the KKW Beauty pop-up is taking place — Kim also paid a visit to the space in the only way she knew how: by posing in a cut-out of her perfume bottle, which is based on her own naked body. Incredible.  The beauty mogul and reality star has been pretty busy over the past few days: She won "Best Reality Show" at the MTV Movie & TV Awards, which aired Monday night, and, yeah, her next stop could be the 2020 election. Big week for Kim! Follow Lauren on Instagram.

			 Those chilly temps hang around through April, you know. Unless you live in California or something, looking outside around late March and early April is depressing, because it's still winter — 40 degrees or lower and snowing — and yet everyone's talking about spring fashion. But just because the weather sucks doesn't mean your wardrobe has to follow suit. Go ahead and ditch your boring gray scarf for something more fresh and fun. Scroll on to see how to breathe a little life into your cold-weather clothing simply by the kind of scarf you choose. Add Color I know, I know. Gray is great, and it goes with everything. And while it's definitely fine to have a neutral scarf in your repertoire, think about wearing something more colorful now that spring is getting closer. What's great about wearing a multicolor item is that, just like a neutral, it coordinates with a bunch of outfits. Take the striped stole above: It lends itself perfectly to the midi dress the model is wearing, because both pieces feature common hues. Same goes for the color-block rectangular scarf below: Since it has swatches of rust and blush, the model's monochrome getup is a great choice — and the accessory becomes the statement piece of the entire look.  $230 SHOP NOW $245 SHOP NOW $350 SHOP NOW $50 SHOP NOW $155 SHOP NOW $68 SHOP NOW $68 SHOP NOW $148 SHOP NOW $185 SHOP NOW  First photo: Faux-Fur Stole, J.

Don’t forget this in the early spring, when the bad weather breaks but temps are still on the chilly side. As the model above demonstrates, a bandana can protect your neck and goes wonderfully with any transitional jacket, including light puffers, leather motos, and oversize denim. A skinny scarf can have the same effect but has the added bonus of looking like a sleek choker — the perfect accessory to wear all day long, whether you're outside or not.  $8 SHOP NOW $18 SHOP NOW $30 SHOP NOW $175 SHOP NOW $18 SHOP NOW $88 SHOP NOW $125 SHOP NOW $5 SHOP NOW $14 SHOP NOW  First photo: Star Bandana, AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS, not available for purchase; SCOTCH & SODA, not available for purchase; Puffer, AMERICAN EAGLE, not available for purchase.

			 The Fug Girls reveal who rocked the red carpet. The 2019 Grammy Awards was a night full of PDA, teleprompter flubs, lip syncing accusations,  and awkward moments—oh, and there was a red carpet, too. Stars decided to go bold, as is Grammys tradition, and some of 'em, well, some of them missed the mark. Here, the Fug Girls break down their favorite and least favorite looks of the night.  God bless Cardi B. On an otherwise underwhelming red carpet, she chose to emerge triumphant in this clamshell extravaganza from Mugler's 1995 couture show, like The Birth of Venus as witnessed by Ryan Seacrest. If you need one thing from the Grammys to mention to a co-worker in order to make awkward small talk while you both wait for the elevator, this is it. We can't figure out why we're not in love with this; maybe it's because that ruffle looks like she accidentally stapled her sleeve to her bodice. But one look at Cardi B being helped into the Grammys with a very nervous-looking entourage, and you just know Gaga was thinking, "Ugh, remember when I needed a staff just to get anywhere in my outfits? This is SO MUCH EASIER." OK, this is a bit of a cheat, because technically this did not happen on the red carpet—although she did at least BRIEFLY pass across it, as the CBS cohosts squealed about her mere seconds before they cut to the broadcast, potentially ruining the surprise—but if we can bend the rules for anyone, we can do it for this former FLOTUS. Especially because she looks so spectacular in this sparkly suit. Sure, Michelle was surrounded by celebrities, but she was the star.   Jennifer Lopez's commitment to doing The Very Most is a relaxing surety in this uncertain world. And this hat is truly a hoot—not the least because when she was onstage, the lights reflected off the jewels around her neck and onto the inside of her hat, making her look like she was inside her own tiny disco. However, the huge brim also rendered J. Lo incapable of getting too physically close to people, which meant she wasn't really able to hug Michelle Obama when they were onstage together. Was it worth it, Jennifer?!  This skirt is a super surreal head-trip of an experience. We admittedly want to touch it—so alluringly textured!—but we're also afraid to love it, in case we piss off The Lorax.  OK, "restrained" might be a weird comment about a pink sparkly column with a sexy open back, but hear us out: Camila is a young former girl-bander who's nominated for her star-making song, "Havana." This choice, guaranteed to make all the pictorials, is a stunning assertion that she is—if we may adapt from The Book of Britney—not a girl, but wholly a woman. This is two tiny design changes away from being a fashion straitjacket, and we've never been more claustrophobic. From her hat's rakish tilt to the plunging vee and sharp sleeves, Janelle makes us wish we paid more attention in geometry all those years ago.  That's a gorgeous cut with a perfect touch of sparkle. We were JUST thinking we'd love to see a lady who shares Chadwick Boseman's taste in coats, and lo, here she is. Heidi is no longer on Project Runway, but she and Tim Gunn are pairing up for another fashion TV project. So is this...a cheeky ode to resurrection?  Yeah, that's a cape. But who's to say that it isn't also the wallpaper from her downstairs powder room? There's basically no color Tracee can't wear, and even when they're brighter than the sun on their own, she somehow manages to enliven them. We also love the slinky snake detail wrapping around her waist. Draco Malfoy wishes anyone in Slytherin had been this rad. When sleeping bags attack!   OK, OK! Maybe boot-cut pants are back.   Ella burst onto the scene with "Boo'd Up" and casually won a Grammy for it last night for Best R&B Song. And just in case that all happened too fast for you to catch who she is, Ella hit the red carpet in this enormous confection that is simply impossible to miss: a dream gown for a dream night. (One might say she got all blue'd up, if one were a hopeless punner, which...we are, so.)  This is so sweet that it's given us, collectively, cavities...but it's also perfectly fitted to her, a Valentine in a mini-dress. 'Tis the season, after all.  We weren't technically wondering what Cher Horowitz would wear to a Prince-themed costume party, but now that we know, we're kind of into it. Bebe Rexha was very open about the fact that several designers declined to dress her for this event because she didn't fit into their sample sizes. The good news is she looks great in this fluffy red ballgown. The bad news is that it feels a bit like a Giambattista Valli knockoff. Maybe next year, they'll get with the program and give her a real one. Visit the Fug Girls on their website, or follow them on Twitter. Their book, The Royal We, is available here.
